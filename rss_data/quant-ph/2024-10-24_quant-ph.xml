      <title>What resources do agents need to acquire knowledge in Quantum Thermodynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst the complexity of acquiring knowledge of a quantum state has been extensively studied in the fields of quantum tomography and quantum learning, a physical understanding of the role of knowledge in quantum thermodynamics is lacking. Knowledge is central to thermodynamics as exemplified by the Maxwell's demon thought experiment where a demonic agent is able to extract paradoxical amounts of work--reconciled by the cost of acquiring this knowledge. In this work, we address this gap by extending known unitary models for the acquisition of quantum knowledge to account for the resources an agent has access to; in particular the dimension of their probe system. We view an agent's knowledge of a quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily. In our model an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system with copies of a lower $k$-dimensional probe, which they then use to reconstruct estimates of the state in $d$-dimensional memories. We find that this framework is a unitary representation of coarse-grained POVMs, connecting thermodynamics and state estimation. As applications it allows us to investigate the role of knowledge in work extraction and state transformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear system algorithm with optimal queries to initial state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for linear systems produce the solution state $A^{-1}|b\rangle$ by querying two oracles: $O_A$ that block encodes the coefficient matrix and $O_b$ that prepares the initial state. We present a quantum linear system algorithm making $\mathbf{\Theta}\left(1/\sqrt{p}\right)$ queries to $O_b$, which is optimal in the success probability, and $\mathbf{O}\left(\kappa\log\left(1/p\right)\left(\log\log\left(1/p\right)+\log\left({1}/{\epsilon}\right)\right)\right)$ queries to $O_A$, nearly optimal in all parameters including the condition number and accuracy. Notably, our complexity scaling of initial state preparation holds even when $p$ is not known $\textit{a priori}$. This contrasts with recent results achieving $\mathbf{O}\left(\kappa\log\left({1}/{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ complexity to both oracles, which, while optimal in $O_A$, is highly suboptimal in $O_b$ as $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily larger than $1/\sqrt{p}$. In various applications such as solving differential equations, preparing ground states of operators with real spectra, and estimating and transforming eigenvalues of non-normal matrices, we can further improve the dependence on $p$ using a block preconditioning scheme to nearly match or outperform best previous results based on other methods, which also furnishes an extremely simple quantum linear system algorithm with an optimal query complexity to $O_A$. Underlying our results is a new Variable Time Amplitude Amplification algorithm with Tunable thresholds (Tunable VTAA), which fully characterizes generic nested amplitude amplifications, improves the $\ell_1$-norm input cost scaling of Ambainis to an $\ell_{\frac{2}{3}}$-quasinorm scaling, and admits a deterministic amplification schedule for the quantum linear system problem.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum chaos without chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is a quantum many-body phenomenon that is associated with a number of intricate properties, such as level repulsion in energy spectra or distinct scalings of out-of-time ordered correlation functions. In this work, we introduce a novel class of "pseudochaotic" quantum Hamiltonians that fundamentally challenges the conventional understanding of quantum chaos and its relationship to computational complexity. Our ensemble is computationally indistinguishable from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of strongly-interacting Hamiltonians, widely considered to be a quintessential model for quantum chaos. Surprisingly, despite this effective indistinguishability, our Hamiltonians lack all conventional signatures of chaos: it exhibits Poissonian level statistics, low operator complexity, and weak scrambling properties. This stark contrast between efficient computational indistinguishability and traditional chaos indicators calls into question fundamental assumptions about the nature of quantum chaos. We, furthermore, give an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate Hamiltonians from our ensemble, even though simulating Hamiltonians from the true GUE is known to require exponential time. Our work establishes fundamental limitations on Hamiltonian learning and testing protocols and derives stronger bounds on entanglement and magic state distillation. These results reveal a surprising separation between computational and information-theoretic perspectives on quantum chaos, opening new avenues for research at the intersection of quantum chaos, computational complexity, and quantum information. Above all, it challenges conventional notions of what it fundamentally means to actually observe complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cooling limits of coherent refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refrigeration limits are of fundamental and practical importance. We here show that quantum systems can be cooled below existing incoherent cooling bounds by employing coherent virtual qubits, even if the amount of coherence is incompletely known. Virtual subsystems, that do not necessarily correspond to a natural eigensubspace of a system, are a key conceptual tool in quantum information science and quantum thermodynamics. We derive universal coherent cooling limits and introduce specific protocols to reach them. As an illustration, we propose a generalized algorithmic cooling protocol that outperforms its current incoherent counterpart. Our results provide a general framework to investigate the performance of coherent refrigeration processes.</description>

      <title>$2+1$ dimensional Floquet systems and lattice fermions: Exact bulk spectral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.</description>

      <title>Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</description>

      <title>Floquet Codes from Coupled Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel construction of the Floquet 3D toric code and Floquet $X$-cube code through the coupling of spin chains. This approach not only recovers the coupling layer construction on foliated lattices in three dimensions but also avoids the complexity of coupling layers in higher dimensions, offering a more localized and easily generalizable framework. Our method extends the Floquet 3D toric code to a broader class of lattices, aligning with its topological phase properties. Furthermore, we generalize the Floquet $X$-cube model to arbitrary manifolds, provided the lattice is locally cubic, consistent with its Fractonic phases. We also introduce a unified error-correction paradigm for Floquet codes by defining a subgroup, the Steady Stabilizer Group (SSG), of the Instantaneous Stabilizer Group (ISG), emphasizing that not all terms in the ISG contribute to error correction, but only those terms that can be referred to at least twice before being removed from the ISG. We show that correctable Floquet codes naturally require the SSG to form a classical error-correcting code, and we present a simple 2-step Bacon-Shor Floquet code as an example, where SSG forms instantaneous repetition codes. Finally, our construction intrinsically supports the extension to $n$-dimensional Floquet $(n,1)$ toric codes and generalized $n$-dimensional Floquet $X$-cube codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability Geometrically Realized in Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principal goal of this paper is to pass all quantum probability formulas to the projective space associated to the complex Hilbert space of a given quantum system. Quantum events have consecutive and conditional probabilities, which have been used in the author's previous work to clarify `collapse' and to generalize the concept of entanglement by incorporating it into quantum probability theory. Also all (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operators will be passed to the projective space setting. In this way all of standard textbook quantum theory can be understood as a geometric theory of projective subspaces without any special role for the zero-dimensional projective subspaces, which are also called pure states. The upshot is that quantum theory is the probability theory of projective subspaces, or equivalently, of quantum events. The ideas are developed here in the context of a type I factor, but comments will be given about how to adopt this approach to more general von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Reinforcement Learning in Latent Observation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum machine learning has sparked interest in using quantum methods to tackle classical control problems via quantum reinforcement learning. However, the classical reinforcement learning environments often scale to high dimensional problem spaces, which represents a challenge for the limited and costly resources available for quantum agent implementations. We propose to solve this dimensionality challenge by a classical autoencoder and a quantum agent together, where a compressed representation of observations is jointly learned in a hybrid training loop. The latent representation of such an autoencoder will serve as a tailored observation space best suited for both the control problem and the QPU architecture, aligning with the agent's requirements. A series of numerical experiments are designed for a performance analysis of the latent-space learning method. Results are presented for different control problems and for both photonic (continuous-variable) and qubit-based agents, to show how the QNN learning process is improved by the joint training.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gaussian interferometric power, entanglement and Gaussian quantum steering in magnonics system with squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a scheme to improve quantum correlations (QCs) between two magnons in a tripartite magnonical system. We use Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) to quantify QCs beyond entanglement. Additionally, Gaussian quantum steering is discussed. We investigate the enhancement of QCs via a squeezing parameter and an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The Mancini criterion is considered to confirm the presence of shared entanglement between the two magnons. We observed a squeezing of about 7dB for the first magnon. Additionally, the squeezed vacuum field and the OPA improve the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement. We hope that current experimental technology will allow the proposed scheme to be implemented.</description>

      <title>Hidden variable theory for non-relativistic QED: the critical role of selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory, despite its remarkable success, struggles to represent certain experimental data, particularly those involving integer functions and deterministic relations between quantum jumps. We address this limitation by proposing a hidden variable theory compatible with non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED). Our approach introduces logical variables to describe propositions about the occupation of stationary states, based on three key assumptions: (i) the probabilities of propositions are predictable by quantum theory, (ii) the truth values of propositions conform to Boolean logic, and (iii) propositions satisfy a novel selection rule: ${\rm{Tr}}[\hat{K}(t)\hat{\rho}\hat{K}^{\dagger}(t)]={\rm{Tr}}[({\mathcal{P}}\hat{K}(t)) \hat{\rho}({\mathcal{P}}\hat{K}(t))^{\dagger}]$. Here, $\hat{K}(t)$ is the product of projection operators for the given propositions, and ${\mathcal{P}}\hat{K}(t)$ denotes $\hat{K}(t)$ rearranged arbitrarily. This selection rule extends the consistency condition in the Consistent Histories approach, relaxing constraints imposed by no-go theorems on logical variable representation, joint probability existence, and measurement contextuality. Consequently, our theory successfully describes the essential properties of individual trials, including the discreteness of quantum jumps, the continuity of classical trajectories, and deterministic relations between entangled subsystems. It achieves this without conflicting with quantum equations of motion, canonical commutation relations, or the operator ordering in quantum coherence functions. The direct description of individual trials made possible by this approach sheds new light on the discrete nature of quantum phenomena and the essence of reality.</description>

      <title>Quantum set theory: Equality and order of internal reals defined through different quantum conditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum logic, there is a well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for conditionals. We currently have three candidates: the Sasaki conditional, the contrapositive Sasaki conditional, and the relevance conditional. A fundamental problem is to show how the form of the conditional follows from an analysis of experimental concepts in quantum theory. Here, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory. For each of the above conditionals, we previously introduced an interpretation of quantum set theory, a quantum logical truth value assignment to every set-theoretical statement, that satisfies both the full forms of De Morgan's laws and the transfer principle. In the present study, we explore the structure of the internal reals based on the new interpretations with different conditionals. We show that the externally defined set of the internal reals is identical for each choice among the above three conditionals, and that for the logic represented by a projection lattice on a Hilbert space, the internal reals are in one-to-one correspondence with the self-adjoint operators (or equivalently, quantum observables) affiliated with the von Neumann algebra generated by the logic. Moreover, we show that the truth values for their equality are also irrespective of the choice among the conditionals. Interestingly, however, the truth values for the order relation significantly depend on the underlying conditionals, whereas the order relation holds with the full truth value if and only if their corresponding self-adjoint operators satisfy Olson's spectral order relation irrespective of the choice of the conditional. We describe the difference of the interpretations of the order relation for two internal reals in terms of the order relation, well defined in quantum mechanics, of outcomes from the successive projective measurements of the corresponding two quantum observables.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Binary-Input Multi-Valued Output Optical Cascades for Reversible and Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

      <title>How to correct Ehrenfest nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems: Ehrenfest plus random force (E$+$$\sigma$) dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key challenge in the study of nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems is to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Although Ehrenfest dynamics (ED) is computationally efficient and well-suited for large complex systems, ED often yields inaccurate results. To address these limitations, we improve the accuracy of the traditional ED by adding a random force (E$+$$\sigma$). In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E$+$$\sigma$ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, E$+$$\sigma$ model still retains the high efficiency of ED and does not incur much additional computation. We believe that this method provides an alternative to accurately describe mixed quantum-classical dynamics in open quantum systems, particularly for large complex systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics for SCTS in the Jaynes-Cummings model with atoms in Werner state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of entanglement within the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), focusing on the behavior of atoms in both Bell and Werner states when subjected to thermal and squeezed photons. We study the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD), atomic inversion, and how various interactions (such as Ising-type, dipole-dipole, and Kerr-nonlinearity) affect these dynamics. This work compares the effects of these interactions and photons on the atomic and field subsystems, providing insights into how thermal and quantum noise impact entanglement behavior in these systems</description>

      <title>Operator entanglement in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric dissipative quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries can lead to nontrivial dynamics of operator entanglement in open quantum many-body systems, which characterizes the cost of an matrix product operator (MPO) representation of the density matrix and provides a measure for the classical simulability. One example is the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric open quantum systems with dephasing, in which the operator entanglement increases logarithmically at late times instead of being suppressed by the dephasing. Here we numerically study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of operator entanglement in a dissipative quantum many-body system with the more complicated $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry and dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that after the initial rise and fall, the operator entanglement also increases again in a logarithmic manner at late times in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric case. We find that this behavior can be fully understood from the corresponding $\mathrm{U}(1)$ subsymmetry by considering the symmetry-resolved operator entanglement. But unlike the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric case with dephasing, both the classical Shannon entropy associated with the probabilities for the half system being in different symmetry sectors and the corresponding symmetry-resolved operator entanglement have nontrivial contributions to the late time logarithmic growth of operator entanglement. Our results show evidence that the logarithmic growth of operator entanglement at long times is a generic behavior of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ as the symmetry or subsymmetry and for more broad dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that the latter is valid even for open quantum systems with only $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry by breaking the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry of our quantum dynamics to $\mathrm{U}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of all superconducting circuits up to 5 nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear superconducting circuits can be used as amplifiers, transducers, and qubits. Only a handful of superconducting circuits have been analyzed or built, so many high-performing configurations likely remain undiscovered. We seek to catalog this design space by enumerating all superconducting circuits -- up to five nodes in size -- built of capacitors, inductors, and Josephson junctions. Using graph isomorphism, we remove redundant configurations to construct a set of unique circuits. We define the concept of a ``Hamiltonian class'' and sort the resulting circuit Hamiltonians based on the types of variables present and the structure of their coupling. Finally, we search for novel superconducting qubits by explicitly considering all three node circuits, showing how the results of our enumeration can be used as a starting point for circuit design tasks.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Dunkl-Pauli Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent Dunkl-Pauli oscillator in two dimensions. We constructed the Dunkl-Pauli Hamiltonian, which incorporates a time-varying magnetic field and a harmonic oscillator characterized by time-dependent mass and frequency, initially in Cartesian coordinates. Subsequently, we reformulated the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates and analyzed the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl angular operator, deriving exact solutions using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. Our findings regarding the total quantum phase factor and wave functions reveal the significant impact of Dunkl operators on quantum systems, providing precise expressions for wave functions and energy eigenvalues. This work enhances the understanding of quantum systems with deformed symmetries and suggests avenues for future research in quantum mechanics and mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interface is an important building block for long-distance quantum networks. Towards a scalable quantum network with high-rate quantum information processing, it requires to develop integrated light-matter interfaces with broadband and multiplexing capacities. Here we demonstrate a light-matter interface at telecom band in an integrated system. A five-spectral-channel atomic-frequency-comb photonic memory is prepared on a laser-written Er3+:LiNbO3 chip. The bandwidth of each channel is 4 GHz with a channel spacing of 15 GHz. The signal photons from time-bin entangled photon pairs at telecom band are sent into the on-chip memory and recalled after a storage time of 152 ns. The entanglement-preserving nature of our integrated quantum interface is assessed by an input/output fidelity of &gt;92% for all the five spectral channels. Our light-matter interfaces constitute a notable step forward toward a high-rate quantum network involving integrated device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a theoretical model for generating microwave beams with non-zero orbital angular momentum utilizing the atomic vapor medium combined with coherent control techniques. Our method involves a difference frequency generation process within a centrosymmetric medium subjected to a dc electric field, enabling frequency conversion and parametric amplification. We have developed a Controlled NOT gate based on a three-level atomic system by satisfying phase-matching conditions and ensuring the conservation of orbital angular momentum. The generation of Laguerre-Gaussian fields in the microwave domain opens up novel possibilities for advanced information processing in wireless communication and offers exciting potential for applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Suppressing chaos with mixed superconducting qubit devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. This result supports designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of quantum methods in the resolution of track findings instances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Track finding can be considered as a complex optimization problem initially introduced in particle physics involving the reconstruction of particle trajectories. A track is typically composed of several consecutive segments (track segments) that resembles a smooth curve without bifurcations. In this paper various modeling approaches are explored in order to assess both their impact and their effectiveness in solving them using quantum and classical methods. We present implementations of three classical models using CPLEX, two quantum models running on actual D-Wave quantum computers, and one quantum model on a D-Wave simulator. To facilitate a fair comparative study and encourage future research in this area, we introduce a new set of benchmark instances, categorized into small, medium, and large scales. Our evaluation of these methods on the benchmark instances indicates that D-Wave methods offer an excellent balance between computation time and result quality, outperforming CPLEX in numerous cases.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in the Spectral Riemann Surfaces of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic training for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model composed of three elements: a classical computer in charge of the data preparation and interpretation; a Gate-based Quantum Computer running the Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) representing the Quantum Neural Network (QNN); and an adiabatic Quantum Computer where the optimization function is executed to find the best parameters for the VQA.
  As of the moment of this writing, the majority of QNNs are being trained using gradient-based classical optimizers having to deal with the barren-plateau effect. Some gradient-free classical approaches such as Evolutionary Algorithms have also been proposed to overcome this effect. To the knowledge of the authors, adiabatic quantum models have not been used to train VQAs.
  The paper compares the results of gradient-based classical algorithms against adiabatic optimizers showing the feasibility of integration for gate-based and adiabatic quantum computing models, opening the door to modern hybrid QML approaches for High Performance Computing.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the generic problem of state preparation for open quantum systems. As is well known, open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation problem becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The SOC problem requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is generally challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by sampling. We derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that can be solved with PI control. Since our method only requires the propagation of state vectors $\psi$, it presents a quadratic advantage over density-centered approaches, such as PMP-based methods. Unlike most conventional quantum control algorithms, it does not require computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal controls. Instead, the optimal control is computed by iterative importance sampling. The SOC setting allows in principle for a state feedback control solution, whereas Lindblad-based methods are restricted to open-loop control. Here, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through some examples of open loop control solutions for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>A distributed and parallel $(k, n)$ QSS scheme with verification capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel Quantum Secret Sharing scheme with $( k, n )$ threshold and endowed with verification capability. The new protocol exploits the power of entanglement and evolves in three phases. The primary novelty of the new protocol lies in its ability to operate completely parallelly in a fully distributed setup, where the spymaster and her agents all are in different locations, in contrast to the vast majority of analogous protocols that assume a localized scenario in which all agents are at the same place. The spymaster sends all necessary information to all intended recipients simultaneously in one step. All phases are executed in parallel, minimizing the overall execution cost of the protocol. Given its comparative complexity, we provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis to establish its information-theoretic security in the sense of preventing both outside eavesdroppers from obtaining any useful information and inside rogue agents from sabotaging its successful completion. The protocol eliminates the need for a quantum signature scheme or pre-shared keys, thereby simplifying the process and lowering complexity. Finally, the possibility of its implementation by contemporary quantum computers is promising because the protocol relies exclusively on CNOT and Hadamard gates and all players operating on similar or identical quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Metro-scale QKD using multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle realisation of a decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol with phase encoding over a record-breaking 17 km of MMF at a rate of 193 kbits/s, as well as over 1 Mbit/s at a distance of 1 km. These results suggest that QKD can be deployed over MMF in metropolitan-scale telecommunication connections. Such MMF metropolitan networks are ubiquitous - thus this advance could pave the way to wide scale metropolitan deployment. We also assess the advantages of adapting the OM3 channel using mode-matching photonic lanterns on the QBER, signal gain, and key rate and compare different encoding techniques in light of MMF propagation effects. This work confirms the suitability of current QKD technology for use in existing MMF links, unlocking new opportunities for quantum applications using legacy fibre.</description>

      <title>Gate Efficient Composition of Hamiltonian Simulation and Block-Encoding with its Application on HUBO, Fermion Second-Quantization Operators and Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a simple formalism which unifies Hamiltonian simulation techniques from different fields. This formalism leads to a competitive method to construct the Hamiltonian simulation with a comprehensible, simple-to-implement circuit generation technique. It leads to a gate decomposition and a scaling different from the usual strategy based on a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) reformulation of the problem. It can significantly reduce the quantum circuit number of rotational gates, multi-qubit gates, and the circuit depth. This method leads to one exact Hamiltonian simulation for each summed term and Trotter step. Each of these Hamiltonian simulation unitary matrices also allows the construction of the non-exponential terms with a maximum of six unitary matrices to be Block-encoding (BE). The formalism is easy to apply to the widely studied High-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO), fermionic transition Hamiltonian, and basic finite difference method instances. For the HUBO, our implementation exponentially reduces the number of gates for high-order cost functions with respect to the HUBO order. The individual electronic transitions are implemented without error for the second-quantization Fermionic Hamiltonian. Finite difference proposed matrix decompositions are straightforward, very versatile, and scale as the state-of-the-art proposals.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically find quantitative, non-perturbative bounds to the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for the multi-atom generalization of the quantum Rabi model: the Dicke model. Precisely, we bound the norm of the difference between the evolutions of states generated by the Dicke model and its rotating-wave approximated counterpart, that is, the Tavis-Cummings model. The intricate role of the parameters of the model in determining the bounds is discussed and compared with numerical results. Our bounds are intrinsically state-dependent and, in particular, are significantly different in the cases of entangled and non-entangled states; this behaviour also seems to be confirmed by the numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes and hyperbolic planes, to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces. We show that the codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations via geometric rotations of the surfaces. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal models capture cause-effect relations both qualitatively - via the graphical causal structure - and quantitatively - via the model parameters. They offer a powerful framework for analyzing and constructing processes. Here, we introduce a tool - the flow of causal structures - to visualize and explore the dynamical aspect of classical-deterministic processes, arguably like those present in general relativity. The flow describes all possible ways in which the causal structure of a process can evolve. We also present an algorithm to construct its supergraph - the superflow - from the causal structure only. Consequently, the superflow of a given process may describe additional unrealizable evolutions of its causal structure. As an application, we show that if all leafs of a flow are trivial, then the corresponding process produces causal correlations only, i.e., correlations where past data influences future events only. This strengthens the result that processes, where the cycles in their causal structure are chordless, establish causal correlations only. We also discuss the main difficulties for the quantum generalization.</description>

      <title>Error convergence of quantum linear system solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm (HHL algorithm) for solving linear problems and of a variant of this algorithm (HHL variant) commonly encountered in literature. This variant relieves the algorithm of preparing an entangled initial state of an auxiliary register. We prove that the computational error of the variant algorithm does not always converge to zero when the number of qubits is increased, unlike the original HHL algorithm. Both algorithms rely upon two fundamental quantum algorithms, the quantum phase estimation and the amplitude amplification. In particular, the error of the HHL variant oscillates due to the presence of undesired phases in the amplitude to be amplified, while these oscillations are suppressed in the original HHL algorithm. Then, we propose a modification of the HHL variant, by amplifying an amplitude of the state vector that does not exhibit the above destructive interference. We also study the complexity of these algorithms in the light of recent results on simulation of unitaries used in the quantum phase estimation step, and show that the modified algorithm has smaller error and lower complexity than the HHL variant. We supported our findings with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Variational Tensor Network Simulation of Gaussian Boson Sampling and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous variable quantum computing platform constitutes a promising candidate for realizing quantum advantage, as exemplified in Gaussian Boson Sampling. While noise in the experiments makes the computation attainable for classical simulations, it has been suggested that the addition of non-linear elements to the experiment will help retain the quantum advantage. We propose a classical simulation tool for general continuous variable sampling problems, including Gaussian Boson Sampling and beyond. We reformulate the sampling problem as that of finding the ground state of a simple few-body Hamiltonian. This allows us to employ powerful variational methods based on tensor networks and to read off the simulation error directly from the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. We validate our method by simulating Gaussian Boson Sampling, where we achieve results comparable to the state of the art. We also consider a non-Gaussian sampling problem, for which we develop novel local basis optimization techniques based on a non-linear parameterization of the implicit basis, resulting in high effective cutoffs with diminished computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Practical implementation of a single-qubit rotation algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Toffoli is an important universal quantum gate, and will alongside the Clifford gates be available in future Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing hardware. Many quantum algorithms rely on performing arbitrarily small single-qubit rotations for their function, and these rotations may also be used to construct any unitary from a limited (but universal) gate set; it is then of significant interest how to carry out such rotations. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed single-qubit rotation algorithm using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set by implementation on both a real and simulated quantum computer. We test the algorithm under various simulated noise levels utilizing a per-qubit depolarizing error noise model, finding that the errors are seemingly explained by a binomial distribution wherein these errors change controlling ancilla measurements from $0$ into $1$. Similar observations appear to hold when conducting live runs; noise levels here make further meaningful conclusions difficult, although for the smallest possible number of ancillary controls we do note that error mitigation is helpful. Our results suggest that the algorithm will perform well under up to $1\%$ noise, under the noise model we chose. Our results also suggest the algorithm could be used as a benchmark for Quantum Processing Units, given its linear increase in total number of qubits and Toffoli gates required.</description>

      <title>Temporally correlated quantum noise in driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous effects of the environment on quantum-mechanical systems generally cause temporally correlated fluctuations. This particularly holds for systems of interest for quantum computation where such effects lead to correlated errors. The Markovian approximation neglects these correlations and thus fails to accurately describe open-system dynamics where these correlations become relevant. In driven open systems, yet another approximation is persistently used, often unknowingly, in which one describes the decay effects independently from the time-dependent controlling fields acting on the system, thereby ignoring further temporally correlated effects. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop a quantum master equation for driven systems weakly coupled to quantum environments that avoids the aforementioned field-independent approximation, as well as the Markovian approximation. Our method makes it possible to track all occurring decay channels and their time-dependent generalized rates which we illustrate in the example of a generally driven two-level system. We also demonstrate that correlated and field-dependent dissipative effects can lead to an increase in the performance of single-qubit gate operations.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Force from an NV center Ensemble on a Microlever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of spin-dependent force induced by Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers embedded in a diamond crystal attached to a tethered oscillator. This result was obtained using a spin-dependent torque generated by a micro-diamond containing billions of NV centers, placed at the end of a commercially available silicon cantilever. We demonstrate that the fundamental flexural mode of the cantilever is excited by the spins of the NV centers. These spins are uniformly coupled to an externally applied homogeneous magnetic field, which enables the NV centers to exert a measurable spin-dependent torque on the cantilever, driving its center of mass motion. Our experiment highlights the intricate interplay between the spin properties of NV centers and the mechanical behavior of the oscillator in the presence of a pure torque, providing a set of tools for exploring quantum effects in state of the art mechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a single-qubit quantum measurement engine fuelled by backaction energy input. To reduce energetic costs associated with information processing, the measurement outcomes are only used with a prescribed laziness probability in the feedback step. As a result, we show that the work extracted over consecutive cycles is a second-order Markov process, analogous to a run-and-tumble process with transient anomalous diffusion. We derive exact analytical expressions for the work finite-time moments and first-passage-time statistics. Furthermore, we find the optimal laziness probability maximizing the mean power extracted per cycle.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Feature Extraction approach for Image Classification using Autoencoders and Quantum SVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to leverage quantum computers for machine learning tasks such as image classification, careful consideration is required: NISQ-era quantum computers have limitations, which include noise, scalability, read-in and read-out times, and gate operation times. Therefore, strategies should be devised to mitigate the impact that complex datasets can have on the overall efficiency of a quantum machine learning pipeline. This may otherwise lead to excessive resource demands or increased noise. We apply a classical feature extraction method using a ResNet10-inspired convolutional autoencoder to both reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and extract abstract and meaningful features before feeding them into a quantum machine learning block. The quantum block of choice is a quantum-enhanced support vector machine (QSVM), as support vector machines typically do not require large sample sizes to identify patterns in data and have short-depth quantum circuits, which limits the impact of noise. The autoencoder is trained to extract meaningful features through image reconstruction, aiming to minimize the mean squared error across a training set. Three image datasets are used to illustrate the pipeline: HTRU-1, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. We also include a quantum-enhanced one-class support vector machine (QOCSVM) for the highly unbalanced HTRU-1 set, as well as classical machine learning results to serve as a benchmark. Finally, the HTRU-2 dataset is also included to serve as a benchmark for a dataset with well-correlated features. The autoencoder achieved near-perfect reconstruction and high classification accuracy for MNIST, while CIFAR-10 showed poorer performance due to image complexity, and HTRU-1 struggled because of dataset imbalance. This highlights the need for a balance between dimensionality reduction through classical feature extraction and prediction performance using quantum methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable entanglement swapping protocol using linear optics and homodyne measurements, capable of producing a large number of high-fidelity Bell pairs per signal, with an approximate $0.5$ probability of success. The effectiveness of the protocol is determined by the squeezing strength. To increase the number of Bell pairs, approximately 3 dB of extra squeezing is needed for each additional Bell pair. The protocol also generates single Bell pairs with an approximate $0.75$ probability for squeezing strengths $\lessapprox 15dB$, achievable with current technology.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging my lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of spin defects in van der Waals material GeS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) attract significant attention for their potential quantum applications. The layered host materials not only facilitate seamless integration with optoelectronic devices but also enable the formation of heterostructures with on-demand functionality. Furthermore, their atomic thickness renders them particularly suitable for sensing applications. However, the short coherence times of the spin defects in hBN limit them in quantum applications that require extended coherence time. One primary reason is that both boron and nitrogen atoms have non-zero nuclear spins. Here, we present another 2D material germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS$_2$) characterized by a wide bandgap and potential nuclear-spin-free lattice. This makes it as a promising host material for spin defects that possess long-coherence time. Our findings reveal the presence of more than two distinct types of spin defects in single-crystal $\beta$-GeS$_2$. Coherent control of one type defect has been successfully demonstrated at both 5 K and room temperature, and the coherence time $T_2$ can achieve tens of microseconds, 100-folds of that of negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) in hBN, satisfying the minimal threshold required for metropolitan quantum networks--one of the important applications of spins. We entatively assign the observed optical signals come from substitution defects. Together with previous theoretical prediction, we believe the coherence time can be further improved with optimized lattice quality, indicating $\beta$-GeS$_2$ as a promising host material for long-coherence-time spins.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing approach to fixed-node Monte Carlo using classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful approaches for solving electronic structure problems. Although they often provide high-accuracy solutions, the precision of most QMC methods is ultimately limited by a trial wave function that must be used. Recently, an approach has been demonstrated to allow the use of trial wave functions prepared on a quantum computer [Nature 603, 416 (2022)] in the auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) method, using classical shadows to estimate the required overlaps. However, this approach has an exponential post-processing step to construct these overlaps, when performing classical shadows obtained using random Clifford circuits. Here, we study an approach to avoid this exponentially scaling step by using a fixed-node Monte Carlo method, based on full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). This method is applied to the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz. We consider H$_4$, ferrocene and benzene molecules using up to 12 qubits as examples. Circuits are compiled to native gates for typical near-term architectures, and we assess the impact of circuit-level depolarizing noise on the method. We also provide a comparison of AFQMC and fixed-node approaches, demonstrating that AFQMC is more robust to errors, although extrapolations of the fixed-node energy reduce this discrepancy. Although the method can be used to reach chemical accuracy, the sampling cost to achieve this is high even for small active spaces, suggesting caution for the prospect of outperforming conventional QMC approaches.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Processes In Quantum Thermodynamics: The Limits Of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in physical processes, despite the fundamentally reversible nature of quantum mechanics, remains an open question in physics. This thesis explores the intricate relationship between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, with a particular focus on minimizing entropy production in finite-time processes. By employing tools from quantum information theory and geometric thermodynamics, we tackle the challenge of deriving irreversible thermodynamic behavior from the reversible microscopic framework of quantum mechanics. We begin with a comprehensive review of the laws of thermodynamics, setting the stage for the subsequent analyses. We introduce novel developments in quantum thermodynamics through a generalized framework for geometric thermodynamics, which enables the derivation of finite-time corrections beyond the Markovian regime. Building on this foundation, we extend Landauer's principle by incorporating a finite-time correction that highlights the necessity of strong coupling for optimal information erasure processes. This result underscores the emergence of Planckian time as a fundamental speed limit to thermalization. Additionally, we explore how collective effects can be harnessed to reduce energy dissipation in thermodynamic operations, revealing that classical correlations between systems can significantly mitigate dissipation, though this may pose new questions regarding the third law of thermodynamics. Finally, we optimize thermodynamic processes in mesoscopic systems, including quantum dot engines and information engines. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the fundamental limits of irreversibility but also open new avenues for research. Future works will focus on fully exploiting collective effects, aligning these with the third law of thermodynamics, and understanding the thermodynamic consistency of master equations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing conical intersections of nucleobases on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms offer significant potential for accelerating the calculation of the electronic structure of strongly correlated molecules. In this work, we present the first quantum simulation of conical intersections (CIs) in a biomolecule, cytosine, using a superconducting quantum computer. We apply the Contracted Quantum Eigensolver (CQE) -- with comparisons to conventional Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) -- to compute the near-degenerate ground and excited states associated with the conical intersection, a key feature governing the photostability of DNA and RNA. The CQE is based on an exact ansatz for many-electron molecules in the absence of noise -- a critically important property for resolving strongly correlated states at CIs. Both methods demonstrate promising accuracy when compared with exact diagonalization, even on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, highlighting their potential for advancing the understanding of photochemical and photobiological processes. The ability to simulate these intersections is critical for advancing our knowledge of biological processes like DNA repair and mutation, with potential implications for molecular biology and medical research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</description>

      <title>How to Design a Quantum Streaming Algorithm Without Knowing Anything About Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of work [GKK+08, Kal22, KPV24] has shown that asymptotic advantages in space complexity are possible for quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts in the streaming model. We give a simple quantum sketch that encompasses all these results, allowing them to be derived from entirely classical algorithms using our quantum sketch as a black box. The quantum sketch and its proof of correctness are designed to be accessible to a reader with no background in quantum computation, relying on only a small number of self-contained quantum postulates.</description>

      <title>Learning $k$-body Hamiltonians via compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $k$-body Hamiltonian with $M$ unknown Pauli terms that are not necessarily geometrically local. We propose a protocol that learns the Hamiltonian to precision $\epsilon$ with total evolution time ${\mathcal{O}}(M^{1/2+1/p}/\epsilon)$ up to logarithmic factors, where the error is quantified by the $\ell^p$-distance between Pauli coefficients. Our learning protocol uses only single-qubit control operations and a GHZ state initial state, is non-adaptive, is robust against SPAM errors, and performs well even if $M$ and $k$ are not precisely known in advance or if the Hamiltonian is not exactly $M$-sparse. Methods from the classical theory of compressed sensing are used for efficiently identifying the $M$ terms in the Hamiltonian from among all possible $k$-body Pauli operators. We also provide a lower bound on the total evolution time needed in this learning task, and we discuss the operational interpretations of the $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ error metrics. In contrast to previous works, our learning protocol requires neither geometric locality nor any other relaxed locality conditions.</description>

      <title>The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory.
  Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.</description>

      <title>Casimir repulsion turned into attraction by the nonlocal response of salted water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii (DLP) theory of Casimir forces predicts a repulsion between two material surfaces separated by a third medium with an intermediate dielectric function. This DLP repulsion paradigm constitutes an important example with many applications. We show here that it is broken when the surfaces interact across salted water due to the nonlocal response of the ions in solution. We consider the interaction between silica and gold and show that the zero-frequency contribution, which is the only one affected by the nonlocal response, is dominant for distances in the range near $100\,{\rm nm}$ and beyond. As a result, the total Casimir force between gold and silica surfaces in salted water is always attractive in spite of the DLP repulsion paradigm.</description>

      <title>Self-similar phase diagram of the Fibonacci-driven quantum Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stroboscopic quantum Ising model with Fibonacci dynamics. Focusing on boundary spin correlation functions in long but finite chains, our simulations as well as analytical arguments reveal a self-similar phase diagram exhibiting regions with Majorana zero modes (MZM) as well as Majorana golden-ratio modes (MGM). We identify the self-similarity transform which governs the evolution of the phase diagram with increasing simulation time. Integrability-breaking perturbations lead to a temporal decay of the boundary spin correlations, ultimaltely limiting the self-similarity of the phase diagram. Our predictions are testable with current quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>KMS states of Information Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field facing a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further exacerbating the regional talent gap due to deficiencies in educational infrastructure and limited financial support. This work presents the efforts of the Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence research group at Universidad Nacional de Colombia to integrate quantum computing into higher education using the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>

      <title>Scale-tailored localization and its observation in non-Hermitian electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect are two paradigmatic wave localization phenomena, resulting from wave interference and the intrinsic non-Hermitian point gap, respectively. In this study, we unveil a novel localization phenomenon associated with long-range asymmetric coupling, termed scale-tailored localization, where the number of induced localized modes and their localization lengths scale exclusively with the coupling range. We show that the long-range coupling fundamentally reshapes the energy spectra and eigenstates by creating multiple connected paths on the lattice. Furthermore, we present experimental observations of scale-tailored localization in non-Hermitian electrical circuits utilizing adjustable voltage followers and switches. The circuit admittance spectra possess separate point-shaped and loop-shaped components in the complex energy plane, corresponding respectively to skin modes and scale-tailored localized states. Our findings not only expand and deepen the understanding of peculiar effects induced by non-Hermiticity but also offer a feasible experimental platform for exploring and controlling wave localizations.</description>

      <title>How High a Field Can Be and Has Been Achieved in Superconducting Bulk Niobium Cavities Across Different RRR Values?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Brief Note explores the relationship between residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and the maximum surface magnetic field in superconducting bulk niobium (Nb) cavities. Data from the 1980s to 2020s, covering RRR values from 30 to 500, are compared with theoretical performance limits, including the lower critical field (Bc1), superheating field (Bsh), and thermal runaway field (Brun). The results show that modern Nb cavities are approaching Brun and the metastability region above Bc1 across the entire RRR range but remain below the fundamental limit at Bsh. Achieving Bsh requires not only advanced high-gradient surface processing but also improved thermal stability with low surface resistance, ultra-pure Nb, and optimized Kapitza conductance to ensure Brun &gt; Bsh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic quantum information processing (QIP) has advanced rapidly due to progress in various nanophotonic platforms. Single photon detectors have been the subject of intense study due to their ubiquity in QIP systems, yet many state-of-the art detectors operate at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum and suffer from long dead times. We propose and demonstrate a single photon detection scheme based on optical parametric amplification in nanophotonic lithium niobate (LN) combined with a classical photodetector. We use quantum detector tomography and experimentally demonstrate an efficiency of 26.5% with a 2.2% dark count rate. We show that by improving the nonlinearity-to-loss ratio in nanophotonics and using homodyne detection on a squeezed pump, the detector can achieve 69% efficiency with 0.9% dark count rate. The detector operates at room temperature, has no intrinsic dead time, and is readily integrated in LN nanophotonics, in which many other components of photonic QIP are available. Our results represent a step towards all-optical ultrafast photon detection for scalable nanophotonic QIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that, the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small, and future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as the precision tests of the SM advances, rarer processes with a greater number of final-state particles will require consideration, which will in turn require the analysis of a multitude of observables. As an inherent consequence of the high luminosity, the generation of a large amount of experimental data in a large feature space presents a significant challenge for data processing. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose a variational quantum searching neighbor~(VQSN) algorithm to search for NP. As an example, we apply the VQSN in the phenomenological study of the gluon quartic gauge couplings~(gQGCs) at the Large Hadron Collider. The results suggest that VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <title>Preempting Fermion Sign Problem: Unveiling Quantum Criticality through Nonequilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, constitutes one of the main obstacles of deciphering quantum many-body systems by numerical approach. The progress in overcoming sign problem will definitely lead to a great leap in various areas of modern physics. Here, by deviating from the conventional cognition that nonequilibrium studies should be more complicated than equilibrium cases, we propose an innovative framework based on nonequilibrium critical dynamics to preempt sign problem and investigate quantum critical point in fermionic model through numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation. By virtue of universal scaling theory of imaginary-time relaxation dynamics, we demonstrate that accurate critical point and critical exponents can be obtained in the short-time stage, in which the sign problem is not severe such that the QMC is accessible. After confirming the effectiveness of the method in two typical interacting fermionic models featuring Dirac quantum critical point (QCP), we for the first time reveal the quantum phase diagram in the Hubbard model hosting $\rm SU(3)$-symmetric Dirac fermions, and find that the QCP between Dirac semi-metal and a $\lambda_8$-antiferromagnetic phase belongs to a new universality class different from the previously known Gross-Neveu transitions.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of gauge-invariant Projected Entangled Pair States</title>

Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are very useful in the description of strongly correlated systems, partly because they allow encoding symmetries, either global or local (gauge), naturally. In recent years, PEPS with local symmetries have increasingly been used in the study of non-perturbative regimes of lattice gauge theories, most prominently as a way to construct variational ansatz states depending only on a small number of parameters and yet capturing the relevant physical properties. For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (Matrix Product States - MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the internal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of the constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only been done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known only how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies on the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this missing piece and study the internal structure of projected entangled pair states with a gauge symmetry. The PEPS we consider consist of matter and gauge field tensors placed on the vertices and edges, respectively, of arbitrary graphs.</description>

Abstract: Solutions for scalable, high-performance optical control are important for the development of scaled atom-based quantum technologies. Modulation of many individual optical beams is central to the application of arbitrary gate and control sequences on arrays of atoms or atom-like systems. At telecom wavelengths, miniaturization of optical components via photonic integration has pushed the scale and performance of classical and quantum optics far beyond the limitations of bulk devices. However, these material platforms for high-speed telecom integrated photonics are not transparent at the short wavelengths required by leading atomic systems. Here, we propose and implement a scalable and reconfigurable photonic architecture for multi-channel quantum control using integrated, visible-light modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate. Our approach combines techniques in free-space optics, holography, and control theory together with a sixteen-channel integrated photonic device to stabilize temporal and cross-channel power deviations and enable precise and uniform control. Applying this device to a homogeneous constellation of silicon-vacancy artificial atoms in diamond, we present techniques to spatially and spectrally address a dynamically-selectable set of these stochastically-positioned point emitters. We anticipate that this scalable and reconfigurable optical architecture will lead to systems that could enable parallel individual programmability of large many-body atomic systems, which is a critical step towards universal quantum computation on such hardware.</description>

      <title>Comparing Three Generations of D-Wave Quantum Annealers for Minor Embedded Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a novel type of analog computation that aims to use quantum mechanical fluctuations to search for optimal solutions of Ising problems. Quantum annealing in the Transverse Ising model, implemented on D-Wave QPUs, are available as cloud computing resources. In this article we report concise benchmarks across three generations of D-Wave quantum annealers, consisting of four different devices, for the NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems unweighted maximum clique and unweighted maximum cut on random graphs. The Ising, or equivalently QUBO, formulation of these problems do not require auxiliary variables for order reduction, and their overall structure and weights are not highly complex, which makes these problems simple test cases to understand the sampling capability of current D-Wave quantum annealers. All-to-all minor embeddings of size $52$, with relatively uniform chain lengths, are used for a direct comparison across the Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr device topologies. A grid search over annealing times and the minor embedding chain strengths is performed in order to determine the level of reasonable performance for each device and problem type. Experiment metrics that are reported are approximation ratios for non-broken chain samples and chain break proportions. How fairly the quantum annealers sample optimal maximum cliques, for instances which contain multiple maximum cliques, is also quantified using entropy of the measured ground state distributions. The newest generation of quantum annealing hardware, which has a Zephyr hardware connectivity, performed the best overall with respect to approximation ratios and chain break frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the unique energy level structure of the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian in combination with standard rotations, we propose the implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage scheme on the Dicke state basis. The method permits to drive Dicke states of the many-atom system into entangled states with maximum quantum Fisher information. The designed states allow to overcome the classical limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology and sensing. We show how to generate superpositions of Dicke states, which maximize metrological gain for a Ramsey interferometric measurement. The proposed scheme is remarkably robust to variations of the driving field and has favorable time scaling, especially for small to moderate (~ 1000) number of atoms, where the total time does not depend on the number of atoms.</description>

      <title>Network-Device-Independent Certification of Causal Nonseparability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal nonseparability is the property underlying quantum processes incompatible with a definite causal order. So far it has remained a central open question as to whether any process with a clear physical realisation can violate a causal inequality, so that its causal nonseparability can be certified in a device-independent way, as originally conceived. Here we present a method solely based on the observed correlations, which certifies the causal nonseparability of all the processes that can induce a causally nonseparable distributed measurement in a scenario with trusted quantum input states, as defined in [Dourdent et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 090402 (2022)]. This notably includes the celebrated quantum switch. This device-independent certification is achieved by introducing a network of untrusted operations, allowing one to self-test the quantum inputs on which the effective distributed measurement induced by the process is performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments in Rydberg atoms have recently found unusually slow decay from a small number of special initial states. We investigate the robustness of such long-lived states (LLS) by studying an ensemble of locally constrained random systems with tunable range $\mu$. Upon varying $\mu$, we find a transition between a thermal and a weakly non-ergodic (supporting a finite number of LLS) phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLS observed in the experiments disappear upon the addition of small perturbations so that the transition reported here is distinct from known ones. We then show that the LLS dynamics explores only part of the accessible Hilbert space, thus corresponding to localisation in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Simulating 2D lattice gauge theories on a qudit quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle physics underpins our understanding of the world at a fundamental level by describing the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories. Yet, despite their unmatched success, the intrinsic quantum mechanical nature of gauge theories makes important problem classes notoriously difficult to address with classical computational techniques. A promising way to overcome these roadblocks is offered by quantum computers, which are based on the same laws that make the classical computations so difficult. Here, we present a quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields and matter. This computation is made possible by the use of a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in $d$ different states per ion, rather than in two states as in qubits. Qudits are ideally suited for describing gauge fields, which are naturally high-dimensional, leading to a dramatic reduction in the quantum register size and circuit complexity. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we find the ground state of the model and observe the interplay between virtual pair creation and quantized magnetic field effects. The qudit approach further allows us to seamlessly observe the effect of different gauge field truncations by controlling the qudit dimension. Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations with qudits in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a random search technique to find quantum gate sequences that implement perfect quantum state preparation or unitary operator synthesis with arbitrary targets. This approach is based on the recent discovery that there is a large multiplicity of quantum circuits that achieve unit fidelity in performing a given target operation, even at the minimum number of single-qubit and two-qubit gates needed to achieve unit fidelity. We show that the fraction of perfect-fidelity quantum circuits increases rapidly as soon as the circuit size exceeds the minimum circuit size required for achieving unit fidelity. This result implies that near-optimal quantum circuits for a variety of quantum information processing tasks can be identified relatively easily by trying only a few randomly chosen quantum circuits and optimizing their parameters. In addition to analyzing the case where the CNOT gate is the elementary two-qubit gate, we consider the possibility of using alternative two-qubit gates. In particular, we analyze the case where the two-qubit gate is the B gate, which is known to reduce the minimum quantum circuit size for two-qubit operations. We apply the random search method to the problem of decomposing the 4-qubit Toffoli gate and find a 15 CNOT-gate decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing combined with quantum eigenvalue transformation has recently emerged as a unifying framework for several quantum algorithms. In its standard form, it consists of two separate routines: block encoding, which encodes a Hamiltonian in a larger unitary, and signal processing, which achieves an almost arbitrary polynomial transformation of such a Hamiltonian using rotation gates. The bottleneck of the entire operation is typically constituted by block encoding and, in recent years, several problem-specific techniques have been introduced to overcome this problem. Within this framework, we present a procedure to block-encode a Hamiltonian based on its matrix product operator (MPO) representation. More specifically, we encode every MPO tensor in a larger unitary of dimension $D+2$, where $D = \lceil\log(\chi)\rceil$ is the number of subsequently contracted qubits that scales logarithmically with the virtual bond dimension $\chi$. Given any system of size $L$, our method requires $L+D$ ancillary qubits in total, while the number of one- and two-qubit gates decomposing the block encoding circuit scales as $\mathcal{O}(L\cdot\chi^2)$.</description>

Abstract: Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order differential equation, system of differential equations, and nonlinear Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Several recent studies have demonstrated the utility of the quantum SWITCH as an important resource for enhancing the performance of various information processing tasks. In a quantum SWITCH, the advantages appear significantly due to the coherent superposition of alternative configurations of the quantum components which are controlled by an additional control system. Here we explore the impact of increasing the Hilbert-space dimension of the control system on the performance of the quantum SWITCH. In particular, we focus on a quantifier of the quantum SWITCH through the emergence of non-Markovianity and explicitly study their behavior when we increase the Hilbert-space dimension of the control system. We observe that increasing the Hilbert-space dimension of the control system leads to the corresponding enhancement of the non-Markovian memory induced by it. Our study demonstrates how the dimension of the control system can be harnessed to improve the quantum SWITCH-based information processing or communication tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13877v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation, which requires deterministically generated large-scale cluster state, is a promising candidate for practical, scalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this work, based on our compact and scalable scheme of generating a two-dimensional spatiotemporal cluster state, a complete architecture including cluster state preparation, gate implementations, and error correction, is demonstrated. First, a scheme for generating two-dimensional large-scale continuous-variable cluster state by multiplexing both the temporal and spatial domains is proposed. Then, the corresponding gate implementations for universal quantum computation by gate teleportation are discussed and the actual gate noise from the generated cluster state is considered. After that, the quantum error correction can be further achieved by utilizing the square-lattice Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. Finally, a fault-tolerant quantum computation can be realized by introducing bias into the square-lattice GKP code (to protect against phase-flip errors) and concatenating a repetition code (to handle the residual bit-flip errors), with a squeezing threshold of 12.3 dB. Our work provides a possible option for a complete fault-tolerant quantum computation architecture in the future.</description>

Abstract: The development of quantum acoustics has enabled the cooling of mechanical objects to their quantum ground state, generation of mechanical Fock-states, and Schrodinger cat states. Such demonstrations have made mechanical resonators attractive candidates for quantum information processing, metrology, and macroscopic tests of quantum mechanics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a direct quantum-acoustic equivalent of a single-atom laser. A single superconducting qubit coupled to a high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator is used to drive the onset of phonon lasing. We observe the absence of a sharp lower lasing threshold and characteristic upper lasing threshold, unique predictions of single-atom lasing. Lasing of an object with a 25 ug mass represents a new regime of laser physics. It provides a possible tool for generating large amplitude coherent states in circuit quantum acoustodynamics, which is important for fundamental and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Low-excitation transport and separation of high-mass-ratio mixed-species ion chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate low-excitation transport and separation of two-ion crystals consisting of one beryllium and one calcium ion, with a high mass ratio of $4.4$. The full separation involves transport of the mixed-species chain, splitting each ion into separate potential wells, and then transport of each ion prior to detection. We find the high mass ratio makes the protocol sensitive to mode crossings between axial and radial modes, as well as to uncontrolled radial electric fields that induce mass-dependent twists of the ion chain. By controlling these stages, we achieve excitation as low as $\bar{n}=1.40 \pm 0.08$ phonons for the calcium ion and $\bar{n}=1.44 \pm 0.09$ phonons for the beryllium ion. Separation and transport of mixed-species chains are key elements of the QCCD architecture, and may also be applicable to quantum-logic-based spectroscopy of exotic species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this paper, we introduce Lie quandles as the minimal mathematical structure needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on the notion of a quandle used most famously in knot theory, whose main defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$. We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras.
  We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of self-distributivity.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Data Storage and Visualization Platform for Collaborative Qubit Control</title>

Abstract: Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce QubiCSV (Qubit Control Storage and Visualization), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Depth Quantum Circuits for Hamming Weight Projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pure state of fixed Hamming weight is a superposition of computational basis states such that each bitstring in the superposition has the same number of ones. Given a Hilbert space of the form $\mathcal{H} = (\mathbb{C}_2)^{\otimes n}$, or an $n$-qubit system, the identity operator can be decomposed as a sum of projectors onto subspaces of fixed Hamming weight. In this work, we propose several quantum algorithms that realize a coherent Hamming weight projective measurement on an input pure state, meaning that the post-measurement state of the algorithm is the projection of the input state onto the corresponding subspace of fixed Hamming weight. We analyze a depth-width trade-off for the corresponding quantum circuits, allowing for a depth reduction of the circuits at the cost of more control qubits. For an $n$-qubit input, the depth-optimal algorithm uses $O(n)$ control qubits and the corresponding circuit has depth $O(\log (n))$, assuming that we have the ability to perform qubit resets. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm construction uses only one- and two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>

      <title>ML-Powered FPGA-based Real-Time Quantum State Discrimination Enabling Mid-circuit Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to reading the transistor state in classical computers, identifying the quantum bit (qubit) state is a fundamental operation to translate quantum information. However, identifying quantum state has been the slowest and most susceptible to errors operation on superconducting quantum processors. Most existing state discrimination algorithms have only been implemented and optimized "after the fact" - using offline data transferred from control circuits to host computers. Real-time state discrimination is not possible because a superconducting quantum state only survives for a few hundred us, which is much shorter than the communication delay between the readout circuit and the host computer (i.e., tens of ms). Mid-circuit measurement (MCM), where measurements are conducted on qubits at intermediate stages within a quantum circuit rather than solely at the end, represents an advanced technique for qubit reuse. For MCM necessitating single-shot readout, it is imperative to employ an in-situ technique for state discrimination with low latency and high accuracy. This paper introduces QubiCML, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based system for real-time state discrimination enabling MCM - the ability to measure the state at the control circuit before/without transferring data to a host computer. A multi-layer neural network has been designed and deployed on an FPGA to ensure accurate in-situ state discrimination. For the first time, ML-powered quantum state discrimination has been implemented on a radio frequency system-on-chip FPGA platform. The deployed lightweight network on the FPGA only takes 54 ns to complete each inference. We evaluated QubiCML's performance on superconducting quantum processors and obtained an average accuracy of 98.5% with only 500 ns readout. QubiCML has the potential to be the standard real-time state discrimination method for the quantum community.</description>

Abstract: Two-party secure quantum remote sensing (SQRS) protocols enable quantum-enhanced measurements at remote locations with guaranteed security against eavesdroppers. This idea can be scaled up to networks of nodes where one party can directly measure functions of parameters at the different nodes using entangled states. However, the security on such networks decreases exponentially with the number of nodes. Here we show how this problem can be overcome in a hybrid protocol that utilises both entangled and separable states to achieve quantum-enhanced measurement precision and security on networks of any size.</description>

      <title>Signatures of superradiance in intensity correlation measurements in a two-emitter solid-state system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform intensity correlation ($g^{(2)}(\tau)$) measurements on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) emitters embedded in diamond nanopillars. We observe an increase in transition rates from both the singlet and triplet states by a factor of $\approx 6$, indicating cooperative effects between the multiple emitters in the pillar, at room temperature. We simultaneously observe a $g^{(2)}(0) &gt; 0.5 (\to 1$) as opposed to $g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.5$ for others (and as expected for single emitters), indicating the presence of at least two emitters. Furthermore, we observe a triple exponential behaviour for the $g^{(2)}$ in contrast to the standard double exponential behaviour seen for single NV emitters. To understand our experimental observations, we developed a theoretical model. We solve the Lindblad master equation, tailored for single and two NV centers, to study their dissipative dynamics when coupled to a common electromagnetic field, at a finite temperature. Through this, we identify superradiant emission from a two-emitter system as the most likely explanation for our observed data. We also find that random number generation using the coupled emitter system performs better under the NIST test suite and explain it in terms of an entropy-driven model for a coupled emitter system. Our results provide a new signature for multiphotonic states, such as superradiant states, using intensity correlation measurements, that will become important for quantum photonic technologies progress.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize machine learning, offering significant efficiency gains in tasks such as clustering and distance estimation. Additionally, it provides enhanced security through fundamental principles like the measurement postulate and the no-cloning theorem, enabling secure protocols such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution. While advancements in secure quantum machine learning are notable, the development of secure and distributed quantum analogues of kernel-based machine learning techniques remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present a novel approach for securely computing common kernels, including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and Laplacian kernels, when data is distributed, using quantum feature maps. Our methodology introduces a robust framework that leverages quantum teleportation to ensure secure and distributed kernel learning. The proposed architecture is validated using IBM's Qiskit Aer Simulator on various public datasets.</description>

Abstract: Simulating chemistry is likely to be among the earliest applications of quantum computing. However, existing digital quantum algorithms for chemical simulation require many logical qubits and gates, placing practical applications beyond existing technology. Here, we use an analog approach to carry out the first quantum simulations of chemical reactions. In particular, we simulate photoinduced non-adiabatic dynamics, one of the most challenging classes of problems in quantum chemistry because they involve strong coupling and entanglement between electronic and nuclear motions. We use a mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) analog simulator, which encodes information in both the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom of a trapped ion. We demonstrate its programmability and versatility by simulating the dynamics of three different molecules as well as open-system dynamics in the condensed phase, all with the same quantum resources. Our approach requires orders of magnitude fewer resources than equivalent digital quantum simulations, demonstrating the potential of analog quantum simulators for near-term simulations of complex chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>How to integrate a miniature optical cavity in a linear ion trap: shielding dielectrics and trap symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One method of scaling up quantum systems is to adopt a modular approach. In the ion trap architecture, an efficient photonic interface between independent linear ion traps would allow for such expansion. To this end, an optical cavity with a small mode volume can be utilised to enhance the photon emission probability from the ion. Miniature fibre-based Fabry-Perot cavities have been integrated into three-dimensional Paul traps that hold a single ion, whereas an efficient interface between an optical cavity and a linear trap that can keep multiple ions has remained elusive. This presents a barrier for combining the benefits of the motional coupling in a chain of ions with optical interface between ion traps. In this paper, we show that simple electrically conductive shielding of the fibres could provide substantial advantage in mitigating the adverse effects of stray charges and motional heating by dielectrics. We also reveal that the conductive shields are not compatible with the conventional radio frequency (rf) drive in ion traps but using two rf signals with opposite phases can solve this issue. Furthermore the role played by the symmetry of the electrodes when incorporating an element that disrupts the translational symmetry of a linear trap is elucidated analytically. As a result it is realized that two-dimensional implementation of a linear ion trap such as a surface trap is inherently not suitable for integrating a shielded miniature optical cavity due to the lack of geometrical symmetry. Based on the insights obtained through the analysis, we identify essential components and a design strategy that should be incorporated in a linear ion trap for successful integration of a miniature optical cavity.</description>

      <title>CountCrypt: Quantum Cryptography between QCMA and PP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QCMA but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution exist. We also construct an oracle relative to which BQP = QMA, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QMA but pseudorandom state generators (a quantum variant of pseudorandom generators) exist. We also show that QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of "quantum samplable" one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if BQP = PP. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if BQP = QCMA, but are broken if BQP = PP. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class "CountCrypt".</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum as a diagnostic of chirality of Topological Spin Liquids: Analysis of an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ PEPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the key question of representation of chiral topological quantum states in (2+1) dimensions (i.e., with non-zero chiral central charge) by Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). A noted result (due to Wahl, Tu, Schuch, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 236805 (2013)], and Dubail and Read [Phys. Rev. B 92, 205307 (2015)]) says that this is possible for non-interacting fermions, but the answer is as yet unknown for interacting systems. Characteristic counting of degeneracies of low-lying states in the entanglement spectrum (ES) at fixed transverse momentum of bipartitioned long cylinders ("Li-Haldane counting") provides often-used supporting evidence for chirality. However, non-chiral PEPS (with zero chiral central charge), yet with strong breaking of time-reversal and reflection symmetries, with invariance under the product of these two operations (i.e., "apparently" chiral states), are known whose low-lying ES exhibits the same Li-Haldane counting as a chiral state in certain topological sectors [Kure\v{c}i\'c, Vanderstraeten, and Schuch, Phys. Rev. B 99, 045116 (2019); Arildsen, Schuch, and Ludwig, Phys. Rev. B 108, 245150 (2023)]. In the present work, we identify a distinct indicator and hallmark of chirality in the ES of PEPS with global $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry: the splittings of conjugate irreps. We prove that in the ES of the chiral states conjugate irreps are exactly degenerate, because the operators that would split them [related to the cubic Casimir invariant of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$] are forbidden. By contrast, in the ES of non-chiral states, conjugate splittings are demonstrably non-vanishing. Such a diagnostic provides an unambiguous and powerful tool to distinguish chiral and non-chiral topological states in (2+1) dimensions via their entanglement spectra.</description>

      <title>Topological frequency conversion in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Eigenstates of Nonintegrable Spin Chains at Infinite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most fundamental sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions -- closed for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations which induce large impurity-impurity correlations, that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to localized impurity clusters. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second Order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Industrially fabricated single-electron quantum dots in Si/Si-Ge heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.</description>
