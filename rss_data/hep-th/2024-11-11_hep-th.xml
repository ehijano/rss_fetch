      <title>Exploring entanglement and spectral split correlations in three-flavor collective neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In environments with prodigious numbers of neutrinos, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early universe, neutrino-neutrino interactions are dynamically significant. They can dominate neutrino flavor evolution and force it to be nonlinear, causing collective neutrino oscillations. Such collective oscillations have been studied numerically, for systems with up to millions of neutrinos, using mean-field or one-particle effective approximations. However, such a system of interacting neutrinos is a quantum many-body system, wherein quantum correlations could play a significant in the flavor evolution-thereby motivating the exploration of many-body treatments which follow the time evolution of these correlations. In many-body flavor evolution calculations with two neutrino flavors, the emergence of spectral splits in the neutrino energy distributions has been found to be correlated with the degree of quantum entanglement across the spectrum. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the emergence of spectral-splits in the three-flavor many-body collective neutrino oscillations. We find that the emergence of spectral splits resembles the number and location found in the mean-field approximation but not in the width. Moreover, unlike in the two-flavor many-body calculations, we find that additional degrees of freedom make it more difficult to establish a correlation between the location of the spectral splits and the degree of quantum entanglement across the neutrino energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Intersection theory, relative cohomology and the Feynman parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for loop integral reduction in the Feynman parametrization using intersection theory and relative cohomology. In this framework, Feynman integrals correspond to boundary-supported differential forms in the language of relative cohomology. The integral reduction can then be achieved by computing intersection numbers. We apply our method in several examples to demonstrate its correctness, and discuss the subtleties in certain degenerate limits.</description>

      <title>CPT Symmetry and its Breaking in the chiral fermion formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a revision of the discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP, and CPT), within an approach that treats 2-component Weyl spinors as the fundamental building blocks. Then, we discuss some salient aspects of the discrete symmetries within quantum field theory (QFT). Besides the generic discussion, we also consider aspects arising within specific renormalizable theories (such as QED and YM). As a new application of the chiral formulation, we discuss the discrete symmetries for the Rarita-Schwinger (RS) spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ field. For the sake of completeness, the elements of linearized gravity (LG) and RS theories are discussed, as they are fundamental to Supergravity (SUGRA). We also discuss the advantages of using the 2-component spinors as the basic building blocks for the formulation of CPT-violating QFTs. Following this formalism, we establish an extension of the general RS theory with terms that violate the Lorentz symmetry and/or CPT symmetry, as well as the one already established in LG.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative AdS black hole and the IR holographic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a noncommutative (NC) AdS$_4$-charged black hole with a planar horizon topology. The NC effects of this geometry are captured by a Gaussian distribution of black hole mass codified in a dust-like energy-momentum tensor. A natural bound in radial coordinate is established, below which the scalar curvature changes its sign and defines a NC cutoff that embeds the point singularity. We study in detail the thermodynamic structure of this scenario, finding a well-defined black hole mass and an analytic criterion for its stability. Focusing on the AdS$_{2}$ structure near the horizon, we find a novel effective curvature radius with dependency on the NC cutoff. These results motivate us to explore the holographic superconducting system in terms of the nearness from the cutoff. The behavior of the magnetic field in the deep IR geometry is studied and we found semi-analytical novel expressions for the upper critical magnetic fields of a dual type-II superconductor in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. The condensation in the form of hair is studied in terms of the bound states of the associated Schr\"odinger potential of the scalar field, interpreted as the dual to the density of Cooper pairs. The NC effects increase the hair formation due to a steeper AdS$_2$ throat comparable to the commutative case. Finally, we obtain the effective IR scalar field equation on the near horizon and near extremal NC Schwarzschild AdS$_2$ geometry and confirm that NC effects promote bound states that the commutative version forbids.</description>

      <title>A Twist on Heterotic Little String Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we significantly expand the web of T-dualities among heterotic NS5-brane theories with eight supercharges. This is achieved by introducing twists involving outer automorphisms of discrete gauge/flavor factors and tensor multiplet permutations along the compactification circle. We assemble field theory data that we propose as invariants across T-dual theories, comprised of twisted Coulomb branch dimensions, higher group structures and flavor symmetry ranks. Using this data, we establish a detailed field theory correspondence between singularities of the compactification space, the number five-branes in the theory, and the flavor symmetry factors. The twisted theories are realized via M-theory compactifications on non-compact genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds without section. This approach allows us to prove duality of twisted and (un-)twisted theories by leveraging M/F-theory duality and identifying inequivalent torus fibrations in the same geometry. We construct several new 5D theories, including a novel type of CHL-like twisted theory where the two M9 branes are identified. Using their field theory invariants, we also construct their dual theories.</description>

      <title>The moduli of the universal geometry of heterotic moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moduli of the universal geometry of $d=4$ $N=1$ heterotic vacua. Universal geometry refers to a family of heterotic vacua fibered over the moduli space. The equations of universal geometry, remarkably, mimic the F-terms and Bianchi identities of heterotic theories. In doing so, they capture otherwise complicated algebraic relations of the original heterotic theory. Here we study first order deformations of the universal geometry. The equations governing the moduli of the universal geometry are remarkably similar to the equations of the underlying heterotic theory and we find a fascinating double extension structure that mirrors the original heterotic problem. As an application we find first order universal deformations determine second order deformations of the original heterotic theory. This gives a shortcut to determining results that are otherwise algebraically unwieldy. The role of the D-terms is closely related to the existence of flat connections on the moduli space. Finally, we re-derive some of these results by direct differentiation - this direct approach requires significantly more calculation.</description>

      <title>A Finite Tension for the $\phi^4_4$ Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1+1 dimensions, it is well known that the quantum states corresponding to solitons are well described by coherent states. In his 1975 Erice lectures, Coleman observed that this construction does not extend to higher dimensions, as the coherent states have infinite energy density. He challenged the students to construct the quantum states corresponding to solitons in higher dimensions, a problem which remains unsolved today. However, even in 1+1 dimensions, the correct quantum states are actually given by deformations of coherent states. In the 3+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ double-well model, we show that the leading deformation, which is just a squeeze, already cancels the one-loop divergence in the energy density of the domain wall soliton.</description>

      <title>No-Go theorem in the cubic subclass of Horndeski theory for spherically symmetric dynamical background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general dynamical, spherically symmetric background in the cubic subclass of Horndeski theory and obtain the quadratic action for the perturbations using the DPSV approach. We analyse the stability conditions for high-energy modes and study the issue of the no-go theorem in the current subclass of Horndeski theory. We formulate the no-go theorem for weak dependence on one variable (time or radial) and derive its generalization to the cases which could be reduced by coordinate transformation to scenarios where the scalar field has weak dependence on one of the coordinates. Moreover we show that wide class of singular solutions are also prohibited within the cubic subclass of Horndeski theory.</description>

      <title>Selection rules of topological solitons from non-invertible symmetries in axion electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a relation between non-invertible symmetries and selection rules of topological solitons such as axionic domain walls and magnetic strings in the $(3+1)$-dimensional axion electrodynamics with a massive axion or a massive photon. In the low-energy limit of the phases where either the axion or the photon is massive, we identify non-invertible 0- or 1-form symmetry generators as axionic domain walls or magnetic strings, respectively. By non-invertible transformations on magnetic monopoles or axionic strings, we give constraints on possible configurations of topological solitons in the presence of the monopoles or axionic strings. Our results are consistent with a solution to the axionic domain wall problem by the magnetic monopole. Further, we give a new constraint on a linked configuration of the magnetic and axionic strings.</description>

      <title>Holographic model for color superconductivity in d-dimension bulk without confinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of holography for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase by considering $d$-dimensional Anti de Sitter (AdS) space instead of the traditional 6 dimensions. The corresponding dual field theory is a gauge theory with $SU(N_c)$ symmetry defined in $(d-1)$-dimensions that, despite lacking a confinement phase, retains characteristics consistent with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) CSC. We then use a holographic model based on Einstein-Maxwell gravity and the standard Maxwell interaction in $d$-dimensional AdS space to investigate this phenomenon for the number of colors $N_c\geq 2$ without confinement phase, identifying the dimensions where the model remains valid for $N_c = 2$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical predictions to differential cross sections and decay rates from the loop-tree duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared singularities in perturbative quantum field theory is of central importance for the development and automation of various theoretical tools that make accurate predictions for observables at high-energy colliders. The loop-tree duality aims to find an efficient solution by treating loop and tree-level contributions under the same foot to achieve a local cancellation of singularities at the integrand level, and thus avoiding dimensional regularisation. In this talk, we exploit the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality representation to present different applications to physical processes at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections to entropy of 3D cosmological solutions from celestial dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a one dimensional Schwarzian type theory was proposed as an effective dual theory of pure gravity in (2+1) dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes. This codimension two `celestial' dual captures the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of bulk flat cosmologies in semiclassical limit. In this paper, we extend this analysis beyond semiclassical approximation and evaluate the one loop partition function of this dual celestial theory. Our analysis results in novel nontrivial logarithmic corrections appearing from the one-loop path integral.</description>

Abstract: We study mathematical aspects concerning two site tree-level cosmological correlators with massive internal and external states in a de Sitter universe. We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>The St\"uckelberg Path to Pure de Sitter Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., whose speed of sound at the rest frame is different from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch and imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <title>On Unitary 2-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global internal symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to extended observables by considering unitary actions of finite global 2-group symmetries $\mathcal{G}$ on line operators. We propose that the latter transform in unitary 2-representations of $\mathcal{G}$, which we classify up to unitary equivalence. Our results recover the known classification of ordinary 2-representations of finite 2-groups, but provide additional data interpreted as a type of reflection anomaly for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum groupoids from moduli spaces of $G$-bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we have constructed the Yangian $Y_\hbar (\mathfrak{d})$ of the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d}=T^*\mathfrak{g}$ for a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, from the geometry of the equivariant affine Grassmanian associated to $G$ with $\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. In this paper, we construct a quantum groupoid $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$ associated to $\mathfrak{d}$ over a formal neighbourhood of the moduli space of $G$-bundles and show that it is a dynamical twist of $Y_\hbar(\mathfrak{d})$. Using this dynamical twist, we construct a dynamical quantum spectral $R$-matrix, which essentially controls the meromorphic braiding of $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$.
  This construction is motivated by the Hecke action of the equivariant affine Grassmanian on the moduli space of $G$-bundles in the setting of coherent sheaves. Heuristically speaking, the quantum groupoid $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$ controls this action at a formal neighbourhood of a regularly stable $G$-bundle. From the work of Costello-Witten-Yamazaki, it is expected that this Hecke action should give rise to a dynamical integrable system. Our result gives a mathematical confirmation of this and an explicit $R$-matrix underlying the integrability.</description>

      <title>Bubble-wall speed with loop corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the nucleating scalar field during the first-order phase transitions by incorporating one-loop corrections of classical fluctuations. We assume that a high-temperature expansion is valid\te where the mass of the scalar field is significantly smaller than the temperature\te so that we can treat the bubble-wall dynamics in a regime where quantum fluctuations can be integrated out. We present a systematic framework for calculating classical loop corrections to the wall speed; contrast our results with traditional methods based on the derivative expansion; show that the latent heat can differ from the effective-potential result; and discuss general hydrodynamic corrections. Finally, we show an application of the presented framework for a simple scalar field model, finding that the one-loop improvement decreases the wall speed and that an effective-potential approximation underestimates full one-loop corrections by about a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of 3d $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found "extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <title>Radiative and exchange corrections for two-neutrino double-beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of radiative and atomic exchange corrections in the two-neutrino double-beta ($2\nu\beta\beta$)-decay of $^{100}$Mo. In the calculation of the exchange correction, the electron wave functions are obtained from a modified Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater self-consistent framework that ensures orthogonality between continuum and bound states. The atomic exchange correction causes a steep increase in the low-energy region of the single-electron spectrum, consistent with previous studies on $\beta$-decay, while the radiative correction primarily accounts for a 5\% increase in the decay rate of $^{100}$Mo. When combined, the radiative and exchange effects cause a leftward shift of approximately 10 keV in the maximum of the summed electron spectrum. This shift may impact current constraints on parameters governing potential new physics scenarios in $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay. The exchange and radiative corrections are introduced on top of our previous description of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay, where we used a Taylor expansion for the lepton energy parameters within the nuclear matrix elements denominators. This approach results in multiple components for each observable, controlled by the measurable $\xi_{31}$ and $\xi_{51}$ parameters. We explore the effects of different $\xi_{31}$ and $\xi_{51}$ values, including their experimental measurements, on the total corrected spectra. These refined theoretical predictions can serve as precise inputs for double-beta decay experiments investigating standard and new physics scenarios within $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1] the asymptotic charges of p-form gauge theories in any dimension are studied. Here we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for the duality map linking asymptotic electric-like charges of the dual descriptions and we give it an algebraic topology interpretation. As a result the duality map has a topological nature and ensures the charge of a description has information of the dual description. The result of the theorem could be generalized to more generic gauge theories where the gauge field is a mixed symmetry tensor leading to a deeper understanding of gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended gravitational models have gained large attention in the last couple of decades. In this work, we examine the solution space of vacuum, static, and spherically symmetric spacetimes within $F(R)$ theories, introducing novel methods that reduce the vacuum equations to a single second-order equation. For the first time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions in terms of the arbitrary functional $F(R)$, providing detailed insight into how the gravitational action impacts the structure of spacetime. We analyze conditions under which solutions are asymptotically flat, regular at the core, and contain an event horizon, obtaining explicit expressions for entropy, temperature, and specific heat in terms of $F(R)$. By using a single metric degree of freedom, we identify the most general solution and examine its (un)physical properties, showing that resolving singularities is not possible within this restricted framework in vacuum. For the general case involving two metric functions, we use several approximation schemes to explore corrections to Schwarzschild-(anti)de Sitter spacetimes, finding that $F(R)$ extensions to General Relativity induce instabilities that are not negligible. Finally, through an analysis of axial perturbations, we derived a general expression for the potential of quasinormal modes of a black hole as a function of the arbitrary Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Echoes from Beyond: Detecting Gravitational Wave Quantum Imprints with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA. In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Conformal Boundary as Holographic Dual to the Hyperbolic Fracton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to describing our universe, gravitational theories profoundly inspire the study of emergent properties of exotic phases of matter. While the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is one of the most celebrated examples, the field of fractonic matter -- driven in part by gapless phases resembling linearized gravity -- has also seen rapid developments. Despite the deep implications of both areas, connections between them remain sparse, primarily due to the difficulty in constructing explicit models that encapsulate both fields' essential features. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of the recently proposed Hyperbolic Fracton Model as a concrete model for AdS/CFT duality. Using explicit numerical and analytical calculations on the discrete hyperbolic lattice, we show that the boundary state exhibits conformal field theory properties. Our main result is that bulk defects induce an emergent temperature for the boundary state, proportional to the defect perimeter, in quantitative agreement with the expected behaviour of a black hole in AdS spacetime. The Hyperbolic Fracton Model thus emerges as a unique lattice model of holographic principle equipped with a well-defined bulk Hamiltonian, and offers a promising gateway for studying a wide range of holographic phenomena.</description>

      <title>(3+1)d boundary topological order of (4+1)d fermionic SPT state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate (3+1)d topological orders in fermionic systems with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry, where its $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ subgroup is the fermion parity. Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Guided by the crystalline correspondence principle, we construct (3+1)d symmetry-preserving gapped states on the boundary of a closely related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N\nmid \nu$, our construction cannot produce any topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; but for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological orders inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</description>

      <title>Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new diagrammatic techniques on $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theories, termed chain and cyclic quiver polymerisation are introduced. These gauge a diagonal $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ subgroup of the Coulomb branch global symmetry of a quiver (or pair of quivers) with multiple legs. The action on the Coulomb branch is that of a $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ hyper-K\"ahler quotient. The polymerisation techniques build and generalise known composition methods from class $\mathcal S$. Polymerisation is used to generate a wide range of magnetic quivers from various physical contexts. These include polymerisation constructions for Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers, which generalise the ADHM construction for the moduli space of $k\;\mathrm{SU}(N)$ instantons on $\mathbb C^2$ to A-type singularities. Also a polymerisation construction of the magnetic quiver for the $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ coming from two $\frac{1}{2}$ M5 branes probing an $E_6$ Klein singularity. We find a method of extending magnetic quivers for Class $\mathcal S$ theories to cure the incomplete Higgsing that arises when gluing punctures into the loops associated with higher genus theories. Other novel constructions include a unitary magnetic quiver for the closure of a height four nilpotent orbit of $\mathrm{SO}(7)$. We explore the relationships between the Coulomb and Higgs branches of quivers under polymerisation.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra, quantum entanglement, and emergent geometry from matrix degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For matrix model and QFT, we discuss how dual gravitational geometry emerges from matrix degrees of freedom (specifically, adjoint scalars in super Yang-Mills theory) and how operator algebra that describes an arbitrary region of the bulk geometry can be constructed. We pay attention to the subtle difference between the notions of wave packets that describe low-energy excitations: QFT wave packet associated with the spatial dimensions of QFT, matrix wave packet associated with the emergent dimensions from matrix degrees of freedom, and bulk wave packet which is a combination of QFT and matrix wave packets. In QFT, there is an intriguing interplay between QFT wave packet and matrix wave packet that connects quantum entanglement and emergent geometry. We propose that the bulk wave packet is the physical object in QFT that describes the emergent geometry from entanglement. This proposal sets a unified view on two seemingly different mechanisms of holographic emergent geometry: one based on matrix eigenvalues and the other based on quantum entanglement. Further intuition comes from the similarity to a traversable wormhole discussed as the dual description of the coupled SYK model by Maldacena and Qi: the bulk can be seen as an eternal traversable wormhole connecting boundary regions.</description>

Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of massless fields and kinematic duality between interior null cones and null infinity</title>

Abstract: The relation between two branches of solutions (radiative and subradiative) of wave equations on Minkowski spacetime is investigated, for any integer spin, in flat Bondi coordinates where remarkable simplifications occur and allow for exact boundary-to-bulk formulae. Each branch carries a unitary irreducible representation of the Poincare group, though an exotic one for the subradiative sector. These two branches of solutions are related by an inversion and, together, span a single representation of the conformal group. While radiative modes are realised in the familiar holographic way (either as boundary data at null infinity or as bulk fields with radiative asymptotic behavior), the whole tower of subradiative modes forms an indecomposable representation of the usual Poincare group, which can be encoded into a single boundary field living on an interior null cone. Lorentz transformations are realised in both cases as conformal transformations of the celestial sphere. The vector space of all subradiative modes carries a unitary representation of a group isomorphic to the Poincare group, where bulk conformal boosts play the role of bulk translations.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach developed by the authors and Ponds in 2022. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance as completeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the physical meaning of modular invariance for unitary conformal quantum field theories in d=2. For QFT models, while T invariance is necessary for locality, S invariance is not mandatory. S invariance is a form of completeness of the theory that has a precise meaning as Haag duality for arbitrary multi-interval regions. We present a mathematical proof as well as derive this result from a physical standpoint using Renyi entropies and the replica trick. For rational CFT's, the failure of modular invariance or Haag duality can be measured by an index, related to the quantum dimensions of the model. We show how to compute this index from the modular transformation matrices. The index also appears in a limit of the Renyi mutual informations. Cases of infinite index are briefly discussed. Part of the argument can be extended to higher dimensions, where the lack of completeness can also be diagnosed using the CFT data through the thermal partition function and measured by an index.</description>

Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analog of Mirzakhani's recursion relation for hyperbolic string vertices and investigate its implications for closed string field theory. Central to our construction are systolic volumes: the Weil-Petersson volumes of regions in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces whose elements have systoles $L \geq 0$. These volumes can be shown to satisfy a recursion relation through a modification of Mirzakhani's recursion as long as $L \leq 2 \sinh^{-1} 1$. Applying the pants decomposition of Riemann surfaces to off-shell string amplitudes, we promote this recursion to hyperbolic string field theory and demonstrate the higher order vertices are determined by the cubic vertex iteratively for any background. Such structure implies the solutions of closed string field theory obey a quadratic integral equation. We illustrate the utility of our approach in an example of a stubbed scalar theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities and prove the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renyi entropy of 2d CFT in KdV generalized ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in chaotic two dimensional CFTs is subtle due to infinitely many conserved KdV charges. Previous works have demonstrated that primary CFT eigenstates have flat entanglement spectrum, which is very different from the microcanonical ensemble. This result is an apparent contradiction to conventional ETH, which does not take KdV charges into account. In a companion paper \cite{KdVETHgeneral}, we resolve this discrepancy by studying the subsystem entropy of a chaotic CFT in KdV-generalized Gibbs and microcanonical ensembles. In this paper, we carry out parallel computations in the context of AdS/CFT. We focus on the high density limit, which is equivalent to thermodynamic limit in conformal theories. In this limit holographic Renyi entropy can be computed using the so-called gluing construction. We explicitly study the KdV-generalized microcanonical ensemble with the densities of the first two KdV charges $\langle \mathcal{Q}_1\rangle = q_1,\langle \mathcal{Q}_3\rangle = q_3$ fixed and obeying $q_3-q_1^2 \ll q_1^2$. In this regime we found that the refined Renyi entropy $\tilde{S}_n$ is $n$-independent for $n&gt;n_{cut}$, where $n_{cut}$ depends on $q_1,q_3$. By taking the primary state limit $q_3\to q_1^2$, we recover flat entanglement spectrum characteristic of fixed-area states, in agreement with the primary state behavior. This provides a consistency check of the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study and generalize the spacetime banana proposal for computing correlation functions of huge operators. First, we introduce time-like and space-like EOW branes into the proposal and demonstrate that: 1) a holographic dual of the one-point function in a BCFT can be obtained and its modified on-shell action reproduces the expected BCFT result; and 2) the GHY term on the stretched horizon can be replaced by the action of an EOW brane which wraps the horizon. Next, we discuss the two (one)-point function of huge spinning operators described by a rotating black hole in the bulk. We show that simply adding a GHY term on the stretched horizon is insufficient to reproduce the CFT results; instead, the appropriate modified action should be the micro-canonical action. Finally. we revisit the existing approaches for computing correlation functions using the gravity on-shell action of conical geometry or Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries. Surprisingly, we find that the on-shells actions of the Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries or the gravity solutions in the Fefferman-Graham gauge yield unexpected incorrect results.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Casimir Effect of Scalar Field: Revisit and New Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For both the one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields at finite temperature, we find the analytic expressions of Gibbs free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy. These results show that the widely used low-temperature approximation of thermal correction of Casimir force, $\pi{T}e^{-\pi{v}\hbar/aT}/2a^3$, have large errors with the exact solution. Here $T$, $v$ and $a$ represent the finite temperature, the velocity of scalar field, and the distance between the two boundaries of the fields, respectively. $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. For three-dimensional scalar field, we find the leading order thermal correction of Gibbs free energy density, $F(a,T)=3\zeta(7/2)aT^4/8\pi^{3/2}(v\hbar)^3$, where $\zeta(.)$ represents the Riemann $\zeta$ function. This thermal correction can not be cancelled by the blackbody radiation density, $\pi^2{a}T^4/90(v\hbar)^3$.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental question in QCD is the existence of a phase transition at large doping of quarks over antiquarks. We present the first prediction of a QCD critical point (CP) from a Bayesian analysis constrained by first principle results at zero doping. We employ the gauge/gravity duality to map QCD onto a theory of dual black holes. Predictions for the CP location in different realizations of the model overlap at one sigma. Even if many prior samples do not include a CP, one is found in nearly 100\% of posterior samples, indicating a strong preference for a CP.</description>

Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis in modified Galileon cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>Flea on the elephant: Tidal Love numbers in subsolar primordial black hole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence from hyper-invariant tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), following hyper-invariant tensor network. The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HaPPY code, including complementary recovery. This framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>Interrelations between dualities in classical integrable systems and classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>$O(N)\times O(2)$ scalar models: including $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$ corrections in the Functional Renormalization Group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.</description>
