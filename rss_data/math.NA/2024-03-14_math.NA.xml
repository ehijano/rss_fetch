      <title>Efficient Matching Boundary Conditions of Two-dimensional Honeycomb Lattice for Atomic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a series of matching boundary conditions for a two-dimensional compound honeycomb lattice, which has an explicit and simple form, high computing efficiency and good effectiveness of suppressing boundary reflections. First, we formulate the dynamic equations and calculate the dispersion relation for the harmonic honeycomb lattice, then symmetrically choose specific atoms near the boundary to design different forms of matching boundary conditions. The boundary coefficients are determined by matching a residual function at some selected wavenumbers. Several atomic simulations are performed to test the effectiveness of matching boundary conditions in the example of a harmonic honeycomb lattice and a nonlinear honeycomb lattice with the FPU-$\beta$ potential. Numerical results illustrate that low-order matching boundary conditions mainly treat long waves, while the high-order matching boundary conditions can efficiently suppress short waves and long waves simultaneously. Decaying kinetic energy curves indicate the stability of matching boundary conditions in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Linear, Exponential-Discontinuous Scheme for Discrete-Ordinates Calculations in Slab Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presented here is a preliminary study of a strictly linear, discontinuous-Petrov-Galerkin scheme for the discrete-ordinates method in slab geometry. By ``linear'', we mean the discretization does not depend on the solution itself as is the case in classical ``fix-up'' schemes and other nonlinear schemes that have been explored to maintain positive solutions with improved accuracy. By discontinuous, we mean the angular flux $\psi$ and scalar flux $\phi$ are piecewise continuous functions that may exhibit discontinuities at cell boundaries. Finally, by ``Petrov-Galerkin,'' we mean a finite-element scheme in which the ``trial'' and ``test'' functions differ. In particular, we find that a trial basis consisting of a constant and exponential function that exactly represents the step-characteristic solution with a constant and linear test basis produces a scheme (1) with slightly better local errors than the linear-discontinuous (LD) scheme (for thin cells), (2) accuracy that approaches the linear-characteristic (LC) scheme (when the LC solution is positive), and (3) is positive as long as the first two source Legendre moments satisfy $|s_1| &lt; 3 s_0$.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Robust a posteriori error control for the Allen-Cahn equation with variable mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a $\gamma$-robust a posteriori error estimator for finite element approximations of the Allen-Cahn equation with variable non-degenerate mobility. The estimator utilizes spectral estimates for the linearized steady part of the differential operator as well as a conditional stability estimate based on a weighted sum of Bregman distances, based on the energy and a functional related to the mobility. A suitable reconstruction of the numerical solution in the stability estimate leads to a fully computable estimator.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Differential Equations Using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations have a wide range of applications in modeling multiple physical, biological, or social phenomena. Therefore, we need to approximate the solutions of these equations in computationally feasible terms. Nowadays, among the most popular numerical methods for solving partial differential equations in engineering, we encounter the finite difference and finite element methods. An alternative numerical method that has recently gained popularity for numerically solving partial differential equations is the use of artificial neural networks.
  Artificial neural networks, or neural networks for short, are mathematical structures with universal approximation properties. In addition, thanks to the extraordinary computational development of the last decade, neural networks have become accessible and powerful numerical methods for engineers and researchers. For example, imaging and language processing are applications of neural networks today that show sublime performance inconceivable years ago.
  This dissertation contributes to the numerical solution of partial differential equations using neural networks with the following two-fold objective: investigate the behavior of neural networks as approximators of solutions of partial differential equations and propose neural-network-based methods for frameworks that are hardly addressable via traditional numerical methods.
  As novel neural-network-based proposals, we first present a method inspired by the finite element method when applying mesh refinements to solve parametric problems. Secondly, we propose a general residual minimization scheme based on a generalized version of the Ritz method. Finally, we develop a memory-based strategy to overcome a usual numerical integration limitation when using neural networks to solve partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>High-order numerical integration on regular embedded surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order surface quadrature (HOSQ) for accurately approximating regular surface integrals on closed surfaces. The initial step of our approach rests on exploiting square-squeezing--a homeomorphic bilinear square-simplex transformation, re-parametrizing any surface triangulation to a quadrilateral mesh. For each resulting quadrilateral domain we interpolate the geometry by tensor polynomials in Chebyshev--Lobatto grids. Posterior the tensor-product Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is applied to compute the resulting integral. We demonstrate efficiency, fast runtime performance, high-order accuracy, and robustness for complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Rectified deep neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of gradient-dependent semilinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical experiments indicate that deep learning algorithms overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating solutions of semilinear PDEs. For certain linear PDEs and semilinear PDEs with gradient-independent nonlinearities this has also been proved mathematically, i.e., it has been shown that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN increases at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. The main contribution of this paper is to rigorously prove for the first time that deep neural networks can also overcome the curse dimensionality in the approximation of a certain class of nonlinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Long-time weak convergence analysis of a semi-discrete scheme for stochastic Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known from the monograph [1, Chapter 5] that the weak convergence analysis of numerical schemes for stochastic Maxwell equations is an unsolved problem. This paper aims to fill the gap by establishing the long-time weak convergence analysis of the semi-implicit Euler scheme for stochastic Maxwell equations. Based on analyzing the regularity of transformed Kolmogorov equation associated to stochastic Maxwell equations and constructing a proper continuous adapted auxiliary process for the semi-implicit scheme, we present the long-time weak convergence analysis for this scheme and prove that the weak convergence order is one, which is twice the strong convergence order. As applications of this result, we obtain the convergence order of the numerical invariant measure, the strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem related to the numerical solution, and the error estimate of the multi-level Monte Carlo estimator. As far as we know, this is the first result on the weak convergence order for stochastic Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>The Fekete problem in segmental polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Fekete problem in segmental and combined nodal-segmental univariate polynomial interpolation by investigating sets of segments, or segments combined with nodes, such that the Vandermonde determinant for the respective polynomial interpolation problem is maximized. For particular families of segments, we will be able to find explicit solutions of the corresponding maximization problem. The quality of the Fekete segments depends hereby strongly on the utilized normalization of the segmental information in the Vandermonde matrix. To measure the quality of the Fekete segments in interpolation, we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized Lebesgue constant linked to the interpolation problem. For particular sets of Fekete segments we will get, similar to the nodal case, a favourable logarithmic growth of this constant.</description>

      <title>Enhanced One-Step Neville Algorithm with Access to the Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recursive Neville algorithm allows one to calculate interpolating functions recursively. Upon a judicious choice of the abscissas used for the interpolation (and extrapolation), this algorithm leads to a method for convergence acceleration. For example, one can use the Neville algorithm in order to successively eliminate inverse powers of the upper limit of the summation from the partial sums of a given, slowly convergent input series. Here, we show that, for a particular choice of the abscissas used for the extrapolation, one can replace the recursive Neville scheme by a simple one-step transformation, while also obtaining access to subleading terms for the transformed series after convergence acceleration. The matrix-based, unified formulas allow one to estimate the rate of convergence of the partial sums of the input series to their limit. In particular, Bethe logarithms for hydrogen are calculated to 100 decimal digits.</description>

      <title>Dynamically accelerating the power iteration with momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose, analyze and demonstrate a dynamic momentum method to accelerate power and inverse power iterations with minimal computational overhead. The method is appropriate for real, diagonalizable matrices, and does not require a priori spectral knowledge. We review and extend background results on previously developed static momentum accelerations for the power iteration through the connection between the momentum accelerated iteration and the standard power iteration applied to an augmented matrix. We show that the augmented matrix is defective for the optimal parameter choice. We then present our dynamic method which updates the momentum parameter at each iteration based on the Rayleigh quotient and two previous residuals. We present convergence and stability theory for the method by considering a power-like method consisting of multiplying an initial vector by a sequence of augmented matrices. We demonstrate the developed method on a number of benchmark problems, and see that it outperforms both the power iteration and often the static momentum acceleration with optimal parameter choice. Finally, we present and demonstrate an explicit extension of the algorithm to inverse power iterations.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Hamiltonian simulation with explicit commutator scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-conditioned multi-product formula (MPF), proposed by [Low, Kliuchnikov, and Wiebe, 2019], is a simple high-order time-independent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm that implements a linear combination of standard product formulas of low order. While the MPF aims to simultaneously exploit commutator scaling among Hamiltonians and achieve near-optimal time and precision dependence, its lack of a rigorous error bound on the nested commutators renders its practical advantage ambiguous. In this work, we conduct a rigorous complexity analysis of the well-conditioned MPF, demonstrating explicit commutator scaling and near-optimal time and precision dependence at the same time. Using our improved complexity analysis, we present several applications of practical interest where the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve a polynomial speedup in both system size and evolution time, as well as an exponential speedup in precision, compared to second-order and even higher-order product formulas. Compared to post-Trotter methods, the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve polynomially better scaling in system size, with only poly-logarithmic overhead in evolution time and precision.</description>

      <title>An FFT based approach to account for elastic interactions in OkMC: Application to dislocation loops in iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object kinetic Montecarlo (OkMC) is a fundamental tool for modeling defect evolution in volumes and times far beyond atomistic models. The elastic interaction between defects is classically considered using a dipolar approximation but this approach is limited to simple cases and can be inaccurate for large and close interacting defects. In this work a novel framework is proposed to include "exact" elastic interactions between defects in OkMC valid for any type of defect and anisotropic media. In this method, the elastic interaction energy of a defect is computed by volume integration of its elastic strain multiplied by the stress created by all the other defects, being both fields obtained numerically using a FFT solver. The resulting interaction energies reproduce analytical elastic solutions and show the limited accuracy of dipole approaches for close and large defects.
  The OkMC framework proposed is used to simulate the evolution in space and time of self-interstitial atoms and dislocation loops in iron. It is found that including the anisotropy has a quantitative effect in the evolution of all the type of defects studied. Regarding dislocation loops, it is observed that using the "exact" interaction energy result in higher interactions than using the dipole approximation for close loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the context of the signal plus random Gaussian noise matrix model. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Wedin-Davis-Kahan theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, extending previous results of O'Rourke, Vu and the author. We also obtain the fine-grained results, which encompass the $\ell_\infty$ analysis of singular vectors, the $\ell_{2, \infty}$ analysis of singular subspaces, as well as the exploration of linear and bilinear functions related to the singular vectors. Moreover, we explore the practical implications of these findings, in the context of the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the minimization of the pseudospectral abscissa of a matrix-valued function dependent on parameters analytically. The problem is motivated by robust stability and transient behavior considerations for a linear control system that has optimization parameters. We describe a subspace procedure to cope with the setting when the matrix-valued function is of large size. The proposed subspace procedure solves a sequence of reduced problems obtained by restricting the matrix-valued function to small subspaces, whose dimensions increase gradually. It possesses desirable features such as the global convergence of the minimal values of the reduced problems to the minimal value of the original problem, and a superlinear convergence exhibited by the decay in the errors of the minimizers of the reduced problems. In mathematical terms, the problem we consider is a large-scale nonconvex minimax eigenvalue optimization problem such that the eigenvalue function appears in the constraint of the inner maximization problem. Devising and analyzing a subspace framework for the minimax eigenvalue optimization problem at hand with the eigenvalue function in the constraint require special treatment that makes use of a Lagrangian and dual variables. There are notable advantages in minimizing the pseudospectral abscissa over maximizing the distance to instability or minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm; the optimized pseudospectral abscissa provides quantitative information about the worst-case transient growth, and the initial guesses for the parameter values to optimize the pseudospectral abscissa can be arbitrary, unlike the case to optimize the distance to instability and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm that would normally require initial guesses yielding asymptotically stable systems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory for mass lumping and its generalization with applications to isogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit time integration schemes coupled with Galerkin discretizations of time-dependent partial differential equations require solving a linear system with the mass matrix at each time step. For applications in structural dynamics, the solution of the linear system is frequently approximated through so-called mass lumping, which consists in replacing the mass matrix by some diagonal approximation. Mass lumping has been widely used in engineering practice for decades already and has a sound mathematical theory supporting it for finite element methods using the classical Lagrange basis. However, the theory for more general basis functions is still missing. Our paper partly addresses this shortcoming. Some special and practically relevant properties of lumped mass matrices are proved and we discuss how these properties naturally extend to banded and Kronecker product matrices whose structure allows to solve linear systems very efficiently. Our theoretical results are applied to isogeometric discretizations but are not restricted to them.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel solver technique for the anisotropic heat flux equation, aimed at the high level of anisotropy seen in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas. Such problems pose two major challenges: (i) discretization accuracy and (ii) efficient implicit linear solvers. We simultaneously address each of these challenges by constructing a new finite element discretization with excellent accuracy properties, tailored to a novel solver approach based on algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods designed for advective operators. We pose the problem in a mixed formulation, introducing the directional temperature gradient as an auxiliary variable. The temperature and auxiliary fields are discretized in a scalar discontinuous Galerkin space with upwinding principles used for discretizations of advection. We demonstrate the proposed discretization's superior accuracy over other discretizations of anisotropic heat flux, achieving error $1000\times$ smaller for anisotropy ratio of $10^9$, for $closed$ $field$ $lines$. The block matrix system is reordered and solved in an approach where the two advection operators are inverted using AMG solvers based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR), which is particularly efficient for upwind discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of advection. To ensure that the advection operators are non-singular, in this paper we restrict ourselves to considering open (acyclic) magnetic field lines for the linear solvers. We demonstrate fast convergence of the proposed iterative solver in highly anisotropic regimes where other diffusion-based AMG methods fail.</description>

      <title>On generalized preconditioners for time-parallel parabolic optimal control</title>

Abstract: The ParaDiag family of algorithms solves differential equations by using preconditioners that can be inverted in parallel through diagonalization. In the context of optimal control of linear parabolic PDEs, the state-of-the-art ParaDiag method is limited to solving self-adjoint problems with a tracking objective. We propose three improvements to the ParaDiag method: the use of alpha-circulant matrices to construct an alternative preconditioner, a generalization of the algorithm for solving non-self-adjoint equations, and the formulation of an algorithm for terminal-cost objectives. We present novel analytic results about the eigenvalues of the preconditioned systems for all discussed ParaDiag algorithms in the case of self-adjoint equations, which proves the favorable properties the alpha-circulant preconditioner. We use these results to perform a theoretical parallel-scaling analysis of ParaDiag for self-adjoint problems. Numerical tests confirm our findings and suggest that the self-adjoint behavior, which is backed by theory, generalizes to the non-self-adjoint case. We provide a sequential, open-source reference solver in Matlab for all discussed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving approximation for the non-isothermal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>

Abstract: In this work we propose and analyse a structure-preserving approximation of the non-isothermal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system using conforming finite elements in space and implicit time discretisation with convex-concave splitting. The system is first reformulated into a variational form which reveal the structure of the equations, which is then used in the subsequent approximation.</description>

      <title>An adaptive mesh refinement strategy to ensure quasi-optimality of the conforming finite element method for the Helmholtz equation via T-coercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the quasi-optimality of the Galerkin finite element method for the Helmholtz equation is dependent on the mesh size and the wave-number. In literature, different criteria have been proposed to ensure quasi-optimality. Often these criteria are difficult to obtain and depend on wave-number explicit regularity estimates. In the present work, we focus on criteria based on T-coercivity and weak T-coercivity, which highlight mesh size dependence on the gap between the square of the wavenumber and Laplace eigenvalues. We also propose an adaptive scheme, coupled with a residual-based indicator, for optimal mesh generation with minimal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>SVD-PINNs: Transfer Learning of Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted significant attention for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in recent years because they alleviate the curse of dimensionality that appears in traditional methods. However, the most disadvantage of PINNs is that one neural network corresponds to one PDE. In practice, we usually need to solve a class of PDEs, not just one. With the explosive growth of deep learning, many useful techniques in general deep learning tasks are also suitable for PINNs. Transfer learning methods may reduce the cost for PINNs in solving a class of PDEs. In this paper, we proposed a transfer learning method of PINNs via keeping singular vectors and optimizing singular values (namely SVD-PINNs). Numerical experiments on high dimensional PDEs (10-d linear parabolic equations and 10-d Allen-Cahn equations) show that SVD-PINNs work for solving a class of PDEs with different but close right-hand-side functions.</description>

      <title>Zero Coordinate Shift: Whetted Automatic Differentiation for Physics-informed Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a critical step in physics-informed machine learning, required for computing the high-order derivatives of network output w.r.t. coordinates of collocation points. In this paper, we present a novel and lightweight algorithm to conduct AD for physics-informed operator learning, which we call the trick of Zero Coordinate Shift (ZCS). Instead of making all sampled coordinates as leaf variables, ZCS introduces only one scalar-valued leaf variable for each spatial or temporal dimension, simplifying the wanted derivatives from "many-roots-many-leaves" to "one-root-many-leaves" whereby reverse-mode AD becomes directly utilisable. It has led to an outstanding performance leap by avoiding the duplication of the computational graph along the dimension of functions (physical parameters). ZCS is easy to implement with current deep learning libraries; our own implementation is achieved by extending the DeepXDE package. We carry out a comprehensive benchmark analysis and several case studies, training physics-informed DeepONets to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) without data. The results show that ZCS has persistently reduced GPU memory consumption and wall time for training by an order of magnitude, and such reduction factor scales with the number of functions. As a low-level optimisation technique, ZCS imposes no restrictions on data, physics (PDE) or network architecture and does not compromise training results from any aspect.</description>
