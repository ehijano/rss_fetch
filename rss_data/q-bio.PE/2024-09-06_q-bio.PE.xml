      <title>A graphical exploration of the relationship between parasite aggregation indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level of aggregation in parasite populations is frequently incorporated into ecological studies. It is measured in various ways including variance-to-mean ratio, mean crowding, the $k$ parameter of the negative binomial distribution and indices based on the Lorenz curve such as the Gini index (Poulin's D) and the Hoover index. Assuming the frequency distributions follow a negative binomial, we use contour plots to clarify the relationships between aggregation indices, mean abundance and prevalence. The contour plots highlight the nonlinear nature of the relationships between these measures and suggest that correlations are not a suitable summary of these relationships.</description>

      <title>Modelling the age distribution of longevity leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human longevity leaders with remarkably long lifespan play a crucial role in the advancement of longevity research. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model to describe the evolution of the age of the oldest person in the world by a Markov process, in which we assume that the births of the individuals follow a Poisson process with increasing intensity, lifespans of individuals are independent and can be characterized by a gamma-Gompertz distribution with time-dependent parameters. We utilize a dataset of the world's oldest person title holders since 1955, and we compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameters iteratively by numerical integration. Based on our preliminary estimates, the model provides a good fit to the data and shows that the age of the oldest person alive increases over time in the future. The estimated parameters enable us to describe the distribution of the age of the record holder process at a future time point.</description>

      <title>Simple measures to capture the robustness and the plasticity of soil microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil microbial communities are known to be robust against perturbations such as nutrition inputs, which appears as an obstacle for the soil improvement. On the other hand, its adaptable aspect has been also reported. Here we propose simple measures for these seemingly contradicting features of soil microbial communities, robustness and plasticity, based on the distribution of the populations. The first measure is the similarity in the population balance, i.e. the shape of the distribution function, which is found to show resilience against the nutrition inputs. The other is the similarity in the composition of the species measured by the rank order of the population, which shows an adaptable response during the population balance is recovering. These results clearly show that the soil microbial system is robust (or, homeostatic) in its population balance, while the composition of the species is rather plastic and adaptable.</description>

      <title>Ecosystem knowledge should replace coexistence and stability assumptions in ecological network modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative population modelling is an invaluable tool for identifying the cascading effects of ecosystem management and interventions. Ecosystem models are often constructed by assuming stability and coexistence in ecological communities as a proxy for abundance data when monitoring programs are not available. However, a growing body of literature suggests that these assumptions are inappropriate for modelling conservation outcomes. In this work, we develop an alternative for dataless population modelling that instead relies on expert-elicited knowledge of species abundances. While time series abundance data is often not available for ecosystems of interest, these systems may still be highly studied or observed in an informal capacity. In particular, limits on population sizes and their capacity to rapidly change during an observation period can be reasonably elicited for many species. We propose a robust framework for generating an ensemble of ecosystem models whose population predictions match the expected population dynamics, as defined by experts. Our new Bayesian algorithm systematically removes model parameters that lead to unreasonable population predictions without incurring excessive computational costs. Our results demonstrate that models constructed using expert-elicited information, rather than stability and coexistence assumptions, can dramatically impact population predictions, expected responses to management, conservation decision-making, and long-term ecosystem behaviour. In the absence of data, we argue that field observations and expert knowledge are preferred for representing ecosystems observed in nature instead of theoretical assumptions of coexistence and stability.</description>
