      <title>Fermionic Dark Matter and New Scalar Production in $e^+e^- \to H^+H^-$ at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pair production process $e^+e^- \to H^+H^-$ in the framework of the scotogenic model. The production mechanism receives contributions at tree level from photon and $Z$-boson exchange, as well as from $t$-channel exchange of the new singlet right-handed fermions $N_{1,2,3}$. where neutrino masses are generated radiatively and one of the singlet right-handed fermions serves as a viable dark matter candidate. We evaluate the individual contributions of these diagrams and compute the total production cross section after imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints on the model parameters, including those associated with dark matter relic abundance and direct detection limits. Our results demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the cross section originates from the exchange of the singlet fermions $N_{1,2,3}$, particularly from the dark matter component of the spectrum. In addition, we examine the dependence of the cross section on the center-of-mass energy for several benchmark scenarios in the allowed parameter space. These predictions can be probed at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, providing a sensitive test of the scotogenic framework and the role of fermionic dark matter, as well as enabling more stringent constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing the $\gamma\gamma^*\to \eta^{(\prime)}$ Transition Form Factors with Newly Derived $\eta^{(\prime)}$-Meson Light-Cone Distribution Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze the properties of the transition form factors (TFFs) for the $\gamma\gamma^*\to \eta^{(\prime)}$ process, employing the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) derived within the light-cone sum rule framework. To this end, we adopt the quark-flavor mixing scheme for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ meson, and compute the TFFs by systematically incorporating transverse-momentum corrections and contributions beyond the leading Fock state. We utilize light-cone harmonic oscillator models to parameterize the longitudinal and transverse behavior of the leading-twist light-cone wavefunction, for which the corresponding LCDA exhibits a unimodal profile. We further examine the potential contributions of intrinsic charm components to the scaled TFFs $Q^2 F_{\eta\gamma}(Q^2)$ and $Q^2 F_{\eta^\prime \gamma}(Q^2)$. Leveraging a range of values for the decay constant $f_{\eta_{c_0}}$ and implementing the $\eta$-$\eta'$-$\eta_c$ and $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$-$G$-$\eta_c$ mixing mechanisms accordingly, together with the recently updated mixing angles, we investigate the impact of the intrinsic $c\bar{c}$ and gluonic component on these observables. In high-$Q^2$ regime, $Q^2 F_{\eta^\prime\gamma}(Q^2)$ exhibits a marked increase in sensitivity to the charm quark component, whereas $Q^2F_{\eta\gamma}(Q^2)$ becomes notably stabilized. A detailed discussion of $\chi^2/d.o.f$ and $p$-values indicates that the intrinsic charm quark component is important and yields a substantial, non-negligible contribution across the entire $Q^2$ range.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Recoil Geometry and Infrared Holonomies in Heavy-Quark Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric formulation of heavy-quark transitions in which infrared-dressed states are adiabatically transported in the multidimensional recoil space and acquire Berry holonomies. Within this framework, single-step decays are governed by an abelian geometric phase and reproduce the standard Isgur-Wise behaviour, while sequential decays probe genuinely non-Abelian holonomies associated with a two-dimensional recoil space. The resulting geometric structure correlates different decay channels and provides a unified interpretation of mixing effects and quasi-degenerate states in heavy-quark phenomenology. This approach suggests that several long-standing puzzles arise as geometric consequences of infrared dressing rather than as accidental features of the microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed description of the calculation of the 2-loop self-energy for a scalar particle is presented. By employing a simple sector decomposition method, the ultraviolet divergent part is efficiently separated from the finite part. The resulting expression can be used for both analytic and numerical computation to renormalize the divergence and to provide finite results for physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical study of $\pi N\to \pi\pi N$ reactions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Argonne National Laboratory-The University of Osaka (ANL-Osaka) DCC model of meson-nucleon reactions, we extend the study of Phys. Rev. C 79, 025206 (2009) and Phys. Rev. C 88, 045203 (2013) to predict the cross sections of the $\pi N \to \pi \pi N$ reactions. The model was constructed by fitting only the two-body reactions: $\pi N,\gamma N \to \pi N, \eta N, K\Lambda, K\Sigma$. Thus, the results for $\pi N \to \pi \pi N$ presented here are predictions of the ANL-Osaka DCC model, which serve to examine the extent to which the forthcoming data from J-PARC can be described. This study provides information for improving the extraction of nucleon resonances that have large decay widths to $\pi\pi N$ states. We present results for the total cross sections, invariant mass distributions, and angular distributions. We also identify the observables and energy regions where the higher mass nucleon resonances in the $S_{31}$, $P_{33}$, $D_{33}$, $F_{37}$, $D_{13}$, $D_{15}$, and $F_{15}$ partial waves can be most effectively investigated.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Dirac-Majorana Confusion Theorem: The Role of CP-Violating Phases in New Physics Vector Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``Practical Dirac-Majorana Confusion Theorem'' said that phenomenological differences between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos are suppressed by $(m_\nu/E)^2$ in lepton-number-conserving processes, making them experimentally indistinguishable at high energies. In this work, we propose a generalization of this theorem by introducing a New Physics vector boson ($Z'$) with CP-violating couplings. We demonstrate that the Majorana condition imposes that only CP-violating imaginary part contributes to the vector neutral interaction. Consequently, the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in cross-section becomes directly dependent on the CP-violating phase $\phi$. We apply this framework to Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS), showing that for spin-zero targets, the distinguishability of the neutrino nature is determined by the CP structure of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Gluon Generalized TMD signatures at the EIC from exclusive heavy (axial-)vector meson production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential experimental signatures of gluon generalized transverse momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs) are proposed via exclusive heavy (axial-)vector meson production in lepton-proton collisions. Within the framework of collinear twist-3 factorization, we show that specific azimuthal-angle-dependent observables can provide sensitivity to the gluon GTMDs $F_{1,4}^g$ and $G_{1,1}^g$, which are related to partonic orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit correlations, respectively. These functions represent a unique sector of nucleon structure with no counterparts in the generalized parton distribution or transverse-momentum-dependent frameworks. We show that interference between different virtual-photon polarizations leads to distinct azimuthal modulations, including the polarization-independent $\cos 2\phi$ and polarization-dependent $\sin 2\phi$ terms, with $\phi$ defined as the angle between the lepton scattering plane and the hadron production plane. These observables provide signatures of the elusive gluon GTMDs $F_{1,4}^g$ and $G_{1,1}^g$, opening a new channel to access the spin structure of the nucleon at the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Production of high-spin $\omega_J/\rho_J$ ($J=3,4,5$) mesons in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the production of high-spin $\omega_J$ and $\rho_J$ mesons ($J=3,4,5$) in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions using an effective Lagrangian approach. By constructing the relevant $t$-channel processes and calibrating the model with a single adjustable parameter fitted to existing data, we successfully reproduce the measured total and differential cross sections for the $J=3$ states $\omega_3(1670)$ and $\rho_3(1690)$. Within the same framework, we predict the production cross sections for the higher-spin partners $\omega_4(2250)$, $\rho_4(2230)$, $\omega_5(2250)$, and $\rho_5(2350)$. Our results show that these states exhibit measurable cross sections with characteristically forward-peaked angular distributions, underscoring their strong potential for observation in future $\pi p$ meson-beam experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement of dynamical fields can be attributed to the absence of corresponding asymptotic states. Thermodynamical properties of such system are more appropriately formulated in terms of collective excitations of these fields, if they appear as particles. This mechanism is investigated in the mean-field quark model of confinement and hadronization. In this model, deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry happen simultaneously at certain critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of decuplet hyperons in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor form factors encode essential information about the internal spin structure and tensor dynamics of baryons. In this work, we investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon hyperons $\Omega^-$, $\Sigma^{*+}$, and $\Xi^{*-}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. For the $\Sigma^{*+}$ and $\Xi^{*-}$ baryons, both isosinglet and isovector tensor currents are considered, allowing us to disentangle flavor-dependent tensor contributions. The complete set of tensor form factors is numerically evaluated in the momentum transfer region $0&lt;Q^2&lt;10~\text{GeV}^2$. In addition, the quark tensor charges of the considered hyperons are extracted in the forward limit. The results provide new non-perturbative insight into the tensor structure and spin content of spin-$3/2$ baryons and offer valuable theoretical input for future phenomenological analyses and experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the chiral unitarity approach to investigate the decay process $\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^+K^+K^-$. by considering that the low lying nucleon resonance $\Xi(1/2^-)$ and the low lying scalar meson $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ that could be dynamically generated through $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon and the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions, respectively. In the invariant mass distributions of $\Sigma^+K^-$ and $K^+K^-$, we observe a distinct peak structure associated with the resonant state $\Xi(1/2^-)$ and a bit enhancement near the $K^+K^-$ threshold that is corresponding to the mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$, respectively. Consequently, we recommend more precise experimental measurements of this process in the future.</description>

      <title>Scattering lengths of the $J/\psi \pi$ and $J/\psi K$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy interactions between the charmonium state $J/\psi$ and the light pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$ and $K$) within the framework of dispersion relations.We demonstrate that the symmetry-breaking terms in the chiral Lagrangian induce mixing between the bare charmonium fields, necessitating a diagonalization procedure to correctly identify the physical $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ states. Following this diagonalization, we relate the threshold scattering amplitudes of $J/\psi{\cal P}~({\cal P}=\pi,K)$, which determine the scattering lengths, to the $J/\psi J/\psi \to {\cal P}\bar{\cal P}$ amplitudes via crossing symmetry. The ${\cal P}\bar{\cal P}$ rescattering effects are incorporated using dispersion relations. We obtain the $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_{J/\psi\pi} \lesssim -0.0021$~fm and $a_{J/\psi K} \lesssim -0.028$~fm, where the negative sign indicates an attractive interaction. Our results show that the $J/\psi K$ interaction is moderately enhanced relative to the pion channel, driven by explicit chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of the coupled-channel mechanism, where $J/\psi\pi$ couples to $D\bar{D}^*$ and $J/\psi K$ couples to $D^*\bar{D}_s/D\bar{D}_s^*$, reveals that both $J/\psi\pi$ and $J/\psi K$ scatterings are predominantly governed by the soft-gluon exchange mechanism.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarkonium Spectrum and Decay Constants from a Neural-Network-Based Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven inverse construction of the dilaton field in a bottom-up AdS/QCD description of heavy vector quarkonia. Instead of adopting an \emph{ad hoc} analytic ansatz, we use a multilayer perceptron to learn \(\Phi'(z)\) as a smooth function of the holographic coordinate, with \(\Phi(0)=0\) imposed to ensure ultraviolet consistency. The dilaton and its derivatives obtained by automatic differentiation generate the holographic potential \(U(z)\), and the associated Schr\"odinger-like equation is discretized and diagonalized to extract the low-lying eigenmodes. Masses and decay constants are then evaluated from the eigenvalues and the near-boundary behavior of the bulk-to-boundary modes. Training on PDG data for charmonium and bottomonium yields a non-quadratic dilaton profile that resolves the longstanding difficulty of simultaneously reproducing both the heavy-quarkonium spectrum and the monotonic suppression of leptonic decay constants with radial excitation. The combined fit achieves RMS deviations of \(1.26\%\) (charmonium) and \(3.32\%\) (bottomonium). This work establishes neural-network reconstruction as a flexible tool for holographic modeling and provides a basis for future extensions incorporating additional channels, lattice constraints, or finite-temperature backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Systematic classification of one-loop models addressing the $b \to s \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent evidence for the decay $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ reported by the Belle II collaboration, combined with the existing constraints on the neutral mode $B^0 \to K^{*0} \nu \bar{\nu}$, implies a deviation from the Standard Model prediction that necessitates New Physics contributions to both left- and right-handed vector currents. We perform a systematic topological classification of renormalizable one-loop completions capable of generating the required dimension-six operators while forbidding tree-level mediation. Based on this classification, we identify and construct two minimal benchmark scenarios -- a scalar-rich model and a fermion-rich model -- and perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis. Our study demonstrates that while these one-loop models can yield enhancements in the $b \to s \nu \bar{\nu}$ branching fractions, the attainable magnitudes are significantly restricted by the combined effects of loop suppression and complementary flavor constraints, limiting their ability to fully accommodate the current anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results from the ATLAS and CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider indicate the existence of a top-quark pair bound state near the $\ttbar$ threshold region. We present a method relying on Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction to reconstruct the toponium bound state at the $\ttbar$ threshold region. We propose incorporating two variables in the analysis that can improve sensitivity to the toponium signal. Our results indicate that this method may be useful to gain additional insights into the physics phenomenology of the $\ttbar$ threshold region.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\mu$-$e$ conversion in $R$-parity violating SUSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mu$-$e$ conversion process is one of the most powerful ways to test lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) interactions involving charged leptons. The standard model with massive neutrinos predicts an extremely low rate for $\mu$-$e$ conversion, making this process an excellent probe for testing LFV arising from new physics. Among many theoretical models that can induce LFV, the Supersymmetric model with R-parity violating interactions is one of the most studied for $\mu$-$e$ conversion. In this work, we revisit trilinear R-parity violating interactions for $\mu$-$e$ conversion, considering renormalization group (RG) running effects from high to low energy scales. The $\mu$-$e$ conversion, $\mu \to e \gamma$, and $\mu \to eee$ experimental data are compared to give upper limits on the relevant 15 combinations of the trilinear $\lambda^{\prime}$ couplings and 6 combinations of the $\lambda$ couplings, certain of which are underexplored in previous studies. We find that RG running effects influence the limits by no more than 30\% in most cases, but can improve constraints by $\sim$80\% in certain combinations, which cannot be neglected. In the near future, COMET and Mu2e are expected to begin data-taking and aim to provide the most stringent constraints on $\mu$-$e$ conversion. These next-generation $\mu$-$e$ experiments have the ability to give much more comprehensive examinations on most trilinear coupling combinations than the $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to 3e$ decay experiments. The $\mu$-$e$ experiments will not only deepen our understanding of LFV but also provide a crucial way to examine the underlying new physics contributions.</description>

      <title>A particle on a ring or: how I learned to stop worrying and love $\theta$-vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ai, Cruz, Garbrecht, and Tamarit (ACGT)~\cite{Ai:2020ptm, Ai:2024vfa, Ai:2024cnp, Ai:2025quf} claimed that there is no strong CP problem by adopting a new order of limits in the volume and topological sector. We critically examine this proposal by focusing on simple one-dimensional quantum mechanics on a ring. We demonstrate that consistent results are obtained only when one sums over all topological sectors \textit{before} taking the large $T$ limit. This observation justifies the conventional path integral formulation of gauge theories and implies that the strong CP problem does exist in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A production of a pair of tau leptons in PbPb collisions at the FCC-hh collider is examined. The 95\% C.L. exclusion limits, as well as 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ sensitivity limits on the anomaly magnetic moment of the tau lepton $a_\tau$ and its electric dipole moment $d_\tau$ are obtained. A comparison with bounds on $a_\tau$ and $d_\tau$ for other future colliders are given.</description>

      <title>Analysis of freeze-in scenario with a scalar Leptoquark and a scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Matter relic density generation through \textit{freeze-in} mechanism where dark matter particles interact feebly with visible sector particles, is an alternative approach to well-studied and most popular \textit{freeze-out} paradigm. We study this \textit{freeze-in} scenario in the presence of a scalar leptoquark interacting with both dark matter and Standard Model particles with renormalizable interactions. We discuss the effect of the presence of such heavy particle, a scalar leptoquark with mass $\geq 1.5 \TeV$, in the thermal bath and subsequent relic density generation. We explore the parameter space of such framework, consisting of two masses and three dimensionless couplings. We numerically study the interaction rates and relic density as a function of these parameters and determine their values consistent with the dark matter constraints.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions for spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-1 hadrons contain different aspects of spin physics from the ones of the spin-1/2 nucleon because of the existence of tensor-polarized structure functions. In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics. This paper is a brief overview on the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions, including transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions up to twist 4.</description>

      <title>Testing residual-symmetry-fixed columns of $U_{\rm PMNS}$ at DUNE and T2HK with initial JUNO constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fixed-column predictions of the lepton mixing matrix that arise from residual symmetries originating in a class of discrete flavour and modular symmetries. While the recent high-precision determination of $\sin^{2}\theta_{12}$ by JUNO already constrains part of these predictions, the remaining ones are primarily characterized by non-trivial correlations between $\sin^{2}\theta_{23}$ and the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$, which are currently only weakly constrained. This motivates a detailed investigation using next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. For the viable scenarios, we derive precise $\sin^{2}\theta_{23}$-$\delta_{\rm CP}$ correlations and use them to generate test-event samples, marginalising over the remaining oscillation parameters. We perform detailed simulations for DUNE and T2HK, presenting allowed regions in the $\sin^{2}\theta_{23}$-$\delta_{\rm CP}$ plane and evaluating the CP-violation fraction as a function of exposure. Our results show that the combined sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK provides a robust test of fixed-column lepton-mixing predictions.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic timelike form factors of hyperons at large transfer momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering reactions ($e^+ e^- \to B \bar B$), in the last two decades. Timelike experiments reveal information about the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the hyperons that cannot be obtained in spacelike experiments (electron scattering on baryons). Motivated by the novel data, we extend to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting, a covariant quark model developed for the spacelike region that takes into account the meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. We use the formalism to calculate the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin 1/2 baryons in the large square transfer momentum $q^2$ region. Our calculations are compared with the available data from CLEO and BESIII above $q^2=10$ GeV$^2$. We conclude that our predictions for the effective form factors (combination between $G_E$ and $G_M$) are in good agreement with the $q^2 &gt; 15$ GeV$^2$ data for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^0$, $\Xi^-$ and $\Xi^0$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^-$ can be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the available data for ratio $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ data range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be performed by upcoming data above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications of the nucleon's structure function $F_2^N$ have been investigated mainly since the discovery of the EMC nuclear effect in 1983, and there were many experimental measurements from the deuteron to a heavy nucleus. Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei.</description>

      <title>Interference-induced entanglement in an effectively zero-lifetime particle pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement in high-energy collisions is often obscured by finite lifetimes, dynamical evolution, and final-state interactions, complicating the identification of genuinely quantum correlations. Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions provide a clean benchmark via the Drell-S${\rm\ddot{o}ding}$ production of nonresonant pion pair, realizing an effectively zero-lifetime particle pair whose quantum correlations are fixed at production and remain robust against subsequent elastic scattering. The coherent superposition of photoproduction amplitudes from two indistinguishable nuclei encodes the linear polarization of quasi-real photons in the orbital motion of the pair, generating a nonfactorizable two-particle quantum state. This entanglement leaves a direct experimental imprint: a characteristic second-harmonic azimuthal modulation in momentum space arising from spin-dependent interference between the two sources. In this paper, we establish a quantitative framework for Drell-S${\rm\ddot{o}ding}$ pion-pair production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and predict the magnitude and transverse-momentum dependence of the entanglement-induced azimuthal asymmetry. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures of interference-induced entanglement and a controlled test of quantum coherence in relativistic environments.</description>

Abstract: The precision of the neutrino oscillation parameters measurements has improved and will continue to improve as the next-generation experiments become online. Beyond the more precise measurements of the mixing angles and phases used to parametrize the lepton mixing matrix, tests of its unitarity are of great interest. This paper studies how the amplitudes of the oscillation patterns can be used and combined to construct leptonic unitarity triangles.</description>

      <title>Another relation among the neutrino mass-squared differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining absolute neutrino masses remains a central challenge in particle physics. Relations among the neutrino mass-squared differences could facilitate this determination and shed additional light on the underlying mass-generation mechanism. Inspired by recent global fits of neutrino oscillation parameters, we propose a simple algebraic relation between $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$. It provides a framework to analytically manipulate these parameters and admits specific physical interpretations. In particular, the results may point toward a vanishing $\nu_1$ mass.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes induced stochastic axion-photon oscillations in primordial magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04605v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced in the very early Universe due to the large density fluctuations. The cosmic background of axion-like particles (ALPs) could be non-thermally generated by PBHs. In this paper, we investigate the ALPs emitted by ultra-light PBHs with the mass range $10 \, {\rm g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^9 \, \rm g$, in which PBHs would have completely evaporated before the start of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and can therefore not be directly constrained. In this case, the minimal scenario that ALPs could interact only with photons is supposed. We study the stochastic oscillations between the ALPs and photons in the cosmic magnetic field in detail. The primordial magnetic field (PMF) can be modelled as the stochastic background field model with the completely non-homogeneous component of the cosmic plasma. Using the latest stringent limits on PMF, we show the numerical results of ALP-photon oscillation probability distributions with the homogeneous and stochastic magnetic field scenarios. The PBH-induced stochastic ALP-photon oscillations in the PMF may have the effects on some further phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), and the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Characteristics of a Fermi Gas with an Invariant Energy Scale and its Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a relativistic Fermi gas governed by a modified dispersion relation in the Magueijo Smolin (MS) formulation of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), characterized by the presence of an invariant ultraviolet energy (deformation) scale. We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>EveNet: A Foundation Model for Particle Collision Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning is transforming data analysis in high-energy physics, computational challenges limit its potential. We address these challenges in the context of collider physics by introducing EveNet, an event-level foundation model pretrained on 500 million simulated collision events using a hybrid objective of self-supervised learning and physics-informed supervision. By leveraging a shared particle-cloud representation, EveNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse tasks, including searches for heavy resonances and exotic Higgs decays, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in low-statistics regimes. Crucially, we validate the transferability of the model to experimental data by rediscovering the $\Upsilon$ meson in CMS Open Data and show its capacity for precision physics through the robust extraction of quantum correlation observables stable against systematic uncertainties. These results indicate that EveNet can successfully encode the fundamental physical structure of particle interactions, which offers a unified and resource-efficient framework to accelerate discovery at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Averaging Theory and Dynamical Systems in Cosmology: A Qualitative Study of Oscillatory Scalar-Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological models using dynamical systems and averaging methods, encompassing flat and open FLRW geometries as well as the LRS Bianchi types I, III, and V. Under mild regularity and frequency-scaling assumptions, we obtain a near-identity conjugacy between the oscillatory flow and an averaged slow flow, with $\| \mathbf{x}(t)-\bar {\mathbf{x}}(t)\| =\mathcal{O}(H(t))$. The effective systems preserve the original asymptotics and yield geometry-dependent late-time attractor classifications. A corollary addresses the case in which the leading averaged vector field vanishes, so the system exhibits no autonomous drift at order $H^0$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Tomography of Flux Tubes in (2+1)D Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entangling properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\le N_c\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $\xi_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $\xi_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both R\'{e}nyi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $\lambda$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Dynamics of Large and Small Systems from a 3D Bayesian Calibration of RHIC Top-energy Collision Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the 3D dynamics of high-energy nuclear collisions is presented. We perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using simulations of large and small collision systems, and a broad range of measurements from the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS collaborations spanning nearly two decades of RHIC operations. In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation using the 3D Glauber model, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with MUSIC. We calibrate the model on rapidity- and $p_T$-differential observables and analyze the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties they provide. We emphasize the additional constraints provided by rapidity-dependent measurements, the differences in large and small system calibrations, and the tension exhibited by particular observables. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in p-Au and $^3$He-Au collisions. Furthermore, we facilitate direct comparison of experimental measurements by highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference, as well as the importance of the centrality selection. In particular, we examine the apparent differences between the STAR and PHENIX $v_2$ and $v_3$ measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter with strangeness in an extended RMF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkyonic matter is expected to play a key role for the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in compact stars. Within the framework of the relativistic mean field (RMF) model and equivparticle model with density-dependent quark masses, we construct the ``quark Fermi sea" with a ``baryon Fermi surface" to characterize the properties of the quarkyonic matter. In particular, we develop a comprehensive framework to account for the strangeness degrees of freedom, incorporating $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Sigma$ hyperons as well as strange quarks in a unified quarkyonic framework. Our calculations indicate that the inevitable emergence of hyperons softens the equations of state, leading to a reduction in the speed of sound around $n_{\rm b}\approx 2n_0$, and consequently reducing the masses and radii of neutron stars. When the quark-hadron phase transition is taken into account, the equation of state at high densities exhibits additional softening, leading to a maximum sound velocity of $v_{\rm max} \approx 0.6\,c$, which is close to the ultrarelativistic limit of $0.58\,c$, consistent with current astronomical observational constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the power spectral density of time delay fluctuations in an interferometer as a potential low-energy quantum gravitational observable. We derive a general expression for the spectrum in terms of the Wightman function of linear metric perturbations, which we then apply to a variety of cases. We analyze the intrinsic graviton fluctuations in the vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states, as well as the fluctuations induced by the vacuum stress-energy of a massless scalar field. We find that the resulting spectra are free of ultraviolet divergences and that, while thermal and squeezed states provide a natural amplification mechanism, the spectra remain suppressed by the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Generation of gravitating solutions with Baryonic charge from Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, an exact correspondence between Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theory and gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models in (3+1) dimensions. By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\sim 40\ \text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\sim 10^{-4}\ \msun$ and radius $\sim 1\ \text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>

      <title>The Regge-Gribov model with odderons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model describing interacting pomerons and odderons is proposed with triple reggeon vertices taking into account the negative signature of the odderon. Its simplified version with zero transverse dimensions is first considered. No phase transition occurs in this case at the intercept crossing unity. This simplified model is studied without more approximations by numerical techniques. The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. Five real fixed points are found with singularities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition as the intercepts cross unity. The new phases, however, are not physical, since they violate the projectile-target symmetry. In the vicinity of fixed points the asymptotical behaviour of Green functions and elastic scattering amplitude is found under Glauber approximation for couplings to participants.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the neutrino background for $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter is a primary goal of modern astronomy and particle physics. Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/\psi$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$, an irreducible background to $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our result for the branching fraction is $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma\nu\bar{\nu})=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is our systematic estimate. This work advances lattice-based determinations of neutrino backgrounds to quarkonium invisible decays, delivering an ab initio benchmark for $J/\psi \to \gamma + \textrm{invisible}$. Our approach generalizes to other quarkonium channels (e.g., $\Upsilon/\phi \to \gamma+\textrm{invisible}$) and provides critical theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>

      <title>The phase structure of QCD: Fluctuations and Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong interaction - governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - shapes the structure of the visible universe. At about 10 $\mu$s after the big bang, the primordial matter made up of quarks and gluons plus leptons, photons and neutrinos, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), became cool enough to create, in a phase transition, the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter, along with other strongly interacting unstable hadrons. This phase transition was predicted within the framework of QCD and has been studied in accelerator laboratories world-wide since about 40 years. This review will explore recent breakthroughs in the study of the QCD phase diagram. We will highlight measurements of particle production and fluctuations, and compare them to theoretical predictions. We summarize our current understanding of the QCD structure and outline future experimental opportunities with high energy nuclear collisions at fixed-target and collider facilities world-wide.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast growth of primordial black holes through radiative absorption</title>

Abstract: We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy on hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of the symmetry energy on the properties of compact stars is analyzed considering constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics. A compact star can be a neutron star composed only of nuclear matter or a hybrid star with a quark core. Two typical models (soft and stiff) are considered for the nuclear equation of state, and for the hybrid one, a parameterized first-order phase transition approach, completed with a linear quark matter equation of state, is implemented. We show that the phase transition reduces the tension between GW170817 and NICER observations, and we illustrate the impact of the symmetry energy for the understanding of the nature of the binary system in GW170817. We also confirm our previous findings that the GW170817 waveform is best described as a binary HS with a low-density onset of stiff quark matter. This could also be interpreted as a quarkyonic cross-over.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of Dark Matter: Derivative Portal Dark Matter. This kind of Dark Matter connects to the Standard Model through a massive mediator, which links to the Standard Model in derivative form. The derivative of a mediator in momentum space corresponds to the mediated momentum, which vanishes in the zero momentum transfer limit. As a result, this kind of Dark Matter can evade stringent constraint from the Dark Matter direct detection while fitting the Dark Matter relic density observation naturally. We explore several UV complete models of this kind of Dark matter. What's more, we show that these models also survive from Dark Matter indirect detection and collider search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores fully leptonic WZ and WW production at the LHC within the SMEFT framework at NLO in QCD, focusing on both CP-even and CP-odd triple-gauge-coupling dimension-six operators. We investigate the off-shell processes, contrasting our findings in inclusive setups with those in the presence of realistic fiducial selections. Alongside the conventional kinematic observables, we examine polarisation-sensitive observables and angular coefficients. Moreover, we assess potential SMEFT effects on asymmetry observables. Through a sensitivity analysis, we identify critical LHC observables that are particularly sensitive to SMEFT-induced modifications, thereby shedding light on potential avenues for new-physics searches in diboson production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

      <title>Real Singlet Scalar Benchmarks in the Multi-TeV Resonance Regime</title>

Abstract: Scalar extensions of the Standard Model are of much interest at the LHC and future colliders. In particular, these models can give rise to resonant di-Higgs production and alter the Higgs trilinear coupling. In this paper, we study di-Higgs production in the Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet with no additional symmetries. We determine how large the resonant di-Higgs rate and variation in the Higgs trilinear coupling can be in four scenarios: current LHC results and projected results at the HL-LHC, the HL-LHC combined with a circular $e^-e^+$ collider such as the CEPC or FCC-ee, and the HL-LHC combined with a linear $e^-e^+$ collider such as the ILC. While these are updated results from a previous study using current LHC data, we go further and find benchmark points in the multi-TeV resonance regime for future colliders beyond the HL-LHC. Considering current LHC results, the resonant di-Higgs rate can still be an order of magnitude larger than the SM predicted di-Higgs rate. In the HL-LHC scenario, the Higgs trilinear coupling can still be a factor of three larger than the SM prediction for resonance masses in the $1.5-3.5$ TeV range, where resonant searches may have less reach. This enhancement is just at the projected 2$\sigma$ sensitivity of the HL-LHC. We find there are resonance masses for which the change in the Higgs trilinear is maximized while the resonant rate is negligible. We provide an analytical understanding of these effects with a discussion on the interplay of various constraints on the parameter space and the Higgs trilinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

Abstract: The formation of light nuclei in high-energy collisions provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction and the structure of the particle-emitting source. Understanding this process is crucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where the production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This work presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function formalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By incorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials constrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach improves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to predict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number $A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of nuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of coalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems and energies.</description>

      <title>Strongly electroweak phase transition with $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ gauged non-zero hypercharge triplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers three non-zero hypercharge triplets as an extension of the Standard Model Higgs doublet. Under extra $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry, the triplets are charged. We examine the stability of the electroweak vacuum at the two-loop and tree-levels. The two-loop $\beta$-functions are found to be capable of satisfying the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale. On the other hand, only up to $10^{12}$ GeV can the perturbative unitarity be satisfied because of the increase in the positive influence from triplet degrees of freedom. For the strongly electroweak first-order phase transition, the parameter space permitted by the Planck scale stability is examined. Because the triplet degrees of freedom contribute sufficiently to the cubic term, the model satisfies the strongly first order phase transition for the triplet bare mass parameters up to the TeV scale. For all mass ranges, it is found that this model predicts a strongly first-order phase transition until the degrees of freedom are heavy enough to separate from the thermal bath. The gravitational wave signatures are tested at the benchmark places that fulfill the strongly first-order phase transition. The measurable frequency range of the LISA and BBO experiments also turns out to contain the benchmark points permitted by Planck scale stability, strongly first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Implications of the KM3NeT Ultrahigh-energy Event on Neutrino Self-interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions ($\nu$SI) mediated by light bosonic particles can produce characteristic spectral dips in astrophysical neutrino fluxes, thereby altering the expected energy spectrum. The high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectrum has been extensively used to probe $\nu$SI models through these distinctive features. The recent detection of the ultrahigh-energy event KM3-230213A presents a new opportunity to explore $\nu$SI phenomenology at extreme energies. In this work, we investigate two implications of this observation, assuming the event originates from a diffuse power-law spectrum. First, we find that $\nu$SI-induced spectral distortions can mildly alleviate the tension between the KM3-230213A detection and the previous non-observation of PeV-scale neutrinos in IceCube data. Second, we derive the strongest constraints on the $\tau$-flavored $\nu$SI coupling strength for mediator masses around 100 MeV. Our analysis shows that neutrino telescopes can surpass existing collider bounds in this mass range. In the near future, IceCube-Gen2 is expected to significantly enhance $\nu$SI sensitivity, including regions relevant to alleviating the Hubble and neutrino mass tensions.</description>

      <title>Global fits and the 95 GeV diphoton excesses in the Supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the ATLAS and CMS experiments have reported modest excesses in the diphoton channel at around 95 GeV.~A number of recent studies have examined whether these could be due to an extended electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) sector, including the well known Georgi-Machacek (GM) model.~Here we examine whether the excesses can be explained by a light exotic Higgs boson in the \emph{Supersymmetric} GM (SGM) model which has the same scalar spectrum as the conventional GM model, but with a more constrained Higgs potential and the presence of custodial Higgsino fermions.~We perform a global fit of the SGM model including all relevant production and decay channels, some of which have been neglected in previous studies, which severely constrain the parameter space.~We find that the SGM model can fit the data if the LHC diphoton excesses at 95\,GeV are due to the lightest custodial singlet Higgs boson which contributes $(5-7)\%$ to EWSB, but \emph{cannot} accommodate the LEP $b\bar{b}$ excess, in contrast to other recent studies of the GM model.~Since the SGM model has a highly constrained Higgs potential, the rest of the mass spectrum is sharply predicted, allowing for targeted searches at the LHC or future colliders.~We also compare the SGM model with the non-supersymmetric GM model and identify how they can be distinguished at the LHC or future colliders.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (such as the extended Wald solution motivated by astrophysical environments), we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. The induced EM field exhibits symmetries that are markedly different from those of the background EM field. Consequently, the induced photon cloud forms an unstable bound configuration that emits EM waves to spatial infinity while being replenished by the axion cloud, providing a potential observational signature of both the presence of an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a global lepton number symmetry can result in a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson known as the Majoron. We study a singlet Majoron model that couples to two Higgs doublets in which the lepton number current develops an electromagnetic anomaly, allowing the decay of Majorons into photons. We focus on Majorons at the eV scale with an enhanced anomaly and show that it serves as a dark matter candidate whose decay signals can be probed by space telescope observations. Furthermore, if the decay produces Lyman-Werner photons, heavy black hole seeds can be generated via the direct collapse mechanism and evolve into the active galactic nuclei we observe at high redshifts. Our framework thus simultaneously addresses the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the nature of dark matter, and the formation of high redshift supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing squared transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Convergence in charmonium structure: light-front wave functions from basis light-front quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based (BLFQ) and Lagrangian-based (DSE) methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Drell--Yan lepton pair production at low invariant masses: transverse-momentum resummation and non-perturbative effects in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton pairs produced with invariant masses ($M$) from low values up to the $Z$-boson peak ($4\leq M \leq 116$~GeV). We present perturbative predictions obtained by consistently combining the resummation of logarithmically enhanced QCD corrections at small $q_T$ ($q_T \ll M$) up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with the available fixed-order calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$) valid at large $q_T$. For very low $q_T$ ($q_T\sim \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$), non-perturbative (NP) QCD effects become dominant and have been included through a NP form factor with a small number of free-parameters. We compare our results with multiple experimental datasets from hadron colliders, finding excellent agreement between theory and data. By fitting the NP parameters, we achieve a precise extraction of the NP form factor and the so-called Collins-Soper kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of quark stars with and without a hadronic crust using an equation of state derived from perturbative QCD that incorporates the running of the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Our analysis reveals that bare quark stars cool too rapidly to match the luminosity data, including those of the coldest observed isolated neutron stars, even when the uncertainty from the renormalization scale is taken into account. In contrast, configurations featuring a hadronic crust exhibit slower cooling and improved agreement with observational data. We also observe that the cooling band for bare quark stars narrows significantly after $t \sim 1$ year, whereas the configurations with a crust exhibit a larger uncertainty throughout their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton confronted with Lattice Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the QCD sum rule method to study the semileptonic weak decay of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$ into the single charmed baryon $\Omega_{c}^{*}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$, corresponding to a $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}$ weak transition. A three-point correlation function is calculated in both the physical and theoretical sides to derive the sum rules for the form factors of the transition. The analysis incorporates both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions up to mass dimension six. After determining the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and performing numerical calculations of the sum rules of the form factors, we extract the $q^2$-dependent fit functions for the form factors. The obtained fit functions are then applied to compute the decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in all lepton channels. Our results, when compared with the future experimental data, can test the Standard Model predictions and probe potential deviations from the theoretical expectations in the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*} \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decay.</description>

      <title>Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that approximate U(1)_L and discrete Z_2 symmetries may give rise to tiny masses of the left--handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

      <title>Lepton polarization dependent angular observables and the polarization asymmetries in the four-fold $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda(\rightarrow N \pi) \ell^+\ell^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare decays mediated by flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as $b \to s \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, provide powerful probes of the Standard Model and potential windows into new physics. Particularly, the angular observables in these exclusive decays are valuable because of their sensitivity to short-distance dynamics and their reduced dependence on hadronic uncertainties, which mainly arise from form factors. In this work, we analyze the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda(\to N\pi)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ (with $N\pi=\{p\pi^-,n\pi^0\}$) decay with polarized final-state lepton and derive the corresponding four-fold differential decay distributions. For the longitudinal, normal, and transverse polarization states, we systematically identify the additional angular coefficients that emerge relative to the unpolarized case. We find that the longitudinal polarization preserves the structure of the unpolarized distribution, while the normal and transverse polarizations introduce some new additional angular coefficients. The analytical expressions of all polarized and unpolarized angular coefficients are explicitly derived in terms of the helicity and transversity amplitudes. To compare the variation in the polarized and unpolarized angular observables, we have plotted them against the square of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Additionally, the Standard Model predictions of the polarization asymmetry observables are provided and their sensitivity to new physics is explored under different new physics scenarios. The obtained results, in the current study, for longitudinal and transverse polarization cases, provide a baseline for the lepton polarization dependent observables, which may serve as sensitive probes to test the Standard Model in these decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving interacting field theories at finite densities remains a numerically and conceptually challenging task, even with modern computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</description>

Abstract: $\gamma^* \gamma \to B \bar{B}$ is the golden process to access chiral-even di-baryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) as deeply virtual Compton scattering has proven to be for the generalized parton distributions. In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $\Lambda, \Sigma$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm \gamma \to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- \gamma \to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs. Our results show that a first extraction of baryon-antibaryon GDAs from experimental measurements is feasible at Belle II.</description>

Abstract: We study the purely leptonic decay of the charged $B$-meson within the $U_1$ Vector Leptoquark model at both leading-order and with one-loop QCD corrections. The structure of this amplitude is characterised by direct quark-lepton couplings which allow for lepton flavour universality violation (LFUV) and additional loop-level topologies. The leptoquark channel contributions to the $B$-meson decay constant are computed and accommodated in its lattice-improved uncertainty bounds by constraining the parameter space of this model in two distinct new-physics scenarios. Under these constraints, we provide predictions for both the LFUV and non-LFUV contributions to the branching fractions of this decay.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainties in the parametrization of Parton Distribution Functions are a serious limiting systematic uncertainty in Large Hadron Collider searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics. This is especially true for measurements at high scales induced by quark and anti-quark collisions, where Drell-Yan continuum backgrounds are dominant. In Phys. Rev. D99, 054004 (2019) we presented a unique strategy for improving uncertainties using neutral current Drell-Yan backgrounds and here we update that strategy and include charged current Drell-Yan final states in the program and demonstrate significant improvements. Through a judicious selection of measurable kinematical quantities can reduce the assigned systematic PDF uncertainties by significant factors in limit-setting or discovery for neutral and charged, high mass Intermediate Vector Bosons. This approach will be take advantage of the huge statistical precision of future High Luminosity, Large Hadron Collider Standard Model datasets and could also improve uncertainties in the high statistics results from LHC Run 3.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the concept of partonic entropy of the proton within the Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution scheme of collinear parton distributions. We show that such entropy increases monotonically with the evolution scale. The mechanism underlying this growth is illustrated using a simplified model of DGLAP evolution, highlighting the importance of including saturation effects at small x in the evolution of parton distributions, which tame the otherwise unbounded growth of partonic entropy. Based on existing literature, we present two simplified models of parton saturation at small x. In one of these models, partonic entropy is identified with entanglement entropy and proposed as an experimentally testable observable.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting charged long-lived BSM particles at MoEDAL-MAPP experiment: A mini-review</title>

Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges.</description>

      <title>Axion-like particles from soft supersymmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a supersymmetric effective field theory in which the mass of an axion-like particle (ALP) is generated predominantly by soft supersymmetry-breaking effects. The Peccei--Quinn symmetry is exact in the supersymmetric limit and is explicitly broken only by soft terms induced by supergravity, leading to a naturally heavy ALP whose mass is controlled by the supersymmetry-breaking scale. We analyze the resulting ALP, saxion, and axino spectrum and investigate the phenomenological implications for laboratory searches, astrophysical observations, and cosmology.
  The framework is treated as an effective field theory without specifying a unique ultraviolet completion, and no attempt is made to explain the origin of a small strong CP phase, which is assumed to be suppressed by ultraviolet physics or by an independent mechanism. Instead, the focus is on the generic and testable phenomenology of heavy axion-like particles whose masses arise from supersymmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states within the BFKL formalism. We complete the recent virtual-correction computation presented in JHEP 12 (2024) 129 by that of the real-emission contributions. We observe the cancellation of the soft divergences between these real- and virtual-emission contributions and we note that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from $N$-body simulations of the Eridanus II Stellar Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of old, compact stellar structures provides strong constraints on macroscopic dark matter candidates such as primordial black holes. In view of recent observational data for the Eridanus II dwarf galaxy, we perform the first $N$-body simulations of its central stellar cluster to model dynamical heating by PBHs. We find evidence that such candidates must be lighter than about one solar mass if they constitute the totality of the dark matter. We additionally derive constraints on the fraction of the dark matter in macroscopic objects as a function of mass, by modeling the remainder of the dark matter as standard, fluid-like cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Confinement and Magnetic Traps for Charges and Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-Disk Collisions for Quasiperiodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Curvature with Fast Radio Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 120 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, and use it to obtain angular-diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ directly from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmology. Then, we combine the FRB-based $H(z)$ with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) DESI DR2 measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$, we constrain spatial curvature. Our covariance-based likelihood (accounting for correlated uncertainties) yields $\Omega_k = -0.31\pm0.57$, while a diagonal (Gaussian) treatment gives $\Omega_k = -0.13\pm0.46$. Both estimations are consistent with spatial flatness at the $1\sigma$ level, albeit with a mild preference for negative curvature. Explicitly accounting for the full covariance broadens the intervals and avoids underestimation of uncertainties. These results highlight the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and their synergy with BAO as a powerful, cosmological model-independent probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Log Gaussian Cox Process Background Modeling in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background modeling is one of the most critical components in high energy physics data analyses, and for smooth backgrounds it is often performed by fitting using an analytic functional form. In this paper a novel method based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) is introduced to model smooth backgrounds while making minimal assumptions on the underlying shape. In LGCP, samples are assumed to be drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process, with an intensity function drawn from a Gaussian process. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for optimizing the hyper parameters and drawing the final fit for the background estimate from the posterior. Synthetic experiments comparing background modeling from functional forms and the LGCP are used to compare the different methods.</description>

      <title>Stimulated radiation from superradiant scalar cloud in scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>
