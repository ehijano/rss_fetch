      <title>Strain-Induced Optical and Molecular Transformations in PET Films for Organic Electronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films are widely used in flexible electronics and optoelectronics, where their mechanical durability and optical performance under strain are essential for device reliability. This study investigates the impact of applied mechanical strain on the optical and molecular properties of PET at room temperature,using UV-Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The work explores how varying strain levels, from 0% (unstretched) to 30%, affect the transparency, vibrational modes, and molecular reorganization within PET films. UV-Vis absorbance measurements reveal that strain induces significant changes in the light transmission properties of PET, particularly in the visible range, and increases absorption in the UVA and visible region by up to 100%. Raman spectra indicate that strain levels higher than 5% lead to irreversible shifts of vibrational lines, accompanied by an increase of their full width at half maximum (FWHM), suggesting molecular reorientation and crystallinity changes. The phonon mode coupled with C-O stretching [O-CH2] shows the strongest response to applied mechanical stress. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of strain-induced optical and structural alterations in PET, with implications for improving the mechanical and optical performance of PET-based devices in strainsensitive applications, such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and flexible sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have proposed Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) boundary conditions at the normal shock front, which is passing through the condensed material. These RH conditions are quite general, and their convenient forms for the particle velocity, mass density, pressure, and temperature have been presented in terms of the upstream Mach number and the material parameters for the weak and the strong shocks, respectively. Finally, the effects on the mechanical quantities of the shock-compressed materials, e.g., titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc., have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Strain energy enhanced room-temperature magnetocaloric effect in second-order magnetic transition materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large magnetic entropy change (deltaSM) can realize a prominent heat transformation under the magnetic field and directly strengthen the efficacy of the magnetocaloric effect, which provides a pioneering environmentally friendly solid-state strategy to improve refrigeration capacities and efficiencies. The second-order magnetic transition (SOMT) materials have broader deltaSM peaks without thermal hysteresis compared with most first-order magnetic transition materials, making them highly attractive in magnetic refrigeration, especially in the room temperature range. Here, we report a significant enhancement of deltaSM at room temperature in single-crystal Mn5Ge3. In this SOMT system, we realize a 60% improvement of -deltaSM from 3.5 J/kgK to 5.6 J/kgK at T = 300K. This considerable enhancement of deltaSM is achieved by intentionally introducing strain energy through high-pressure constrained deformation. Both experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the enhancement of deltaSM originates from the microscopic strain and lattice deformation induced by strain energy after deformation. This strain energy will reconstruct the energy landscape of this ferromagnetic system and enhance magnetization, resulting in a giant intensity of magnetocaloric responses. Our findings provide an approach to increase magnetic entropy change and may give fresh ideas for exploring advanced magnetocaloric materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <title>TE optical isolator based on TMOKE coupled-waveguide system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increasingly require more advanced integrated functionalities and devices to meet the key application challenges. This evolution with the serial integration of optical functions in the same photonic circuit often results in internal reflections and optical feedback, which can specifically destabilize lasers. One solution to overcome this issue is to integrate an optical isolator at the output of the lasers. Among various proposed designs, magneto-optical-based isolators have significantly improved over the past decades in terms of compactness, insertion loss, isolation ratio, and spectral isolation bandwidth. Despite these improvements, the TE optical isolator still lacks in performance. This paper introduces a new operational principle for a TE optical isolator based on modal beating in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) coupled-waveguide system. This approach combines evanescent-coupled silicon waveguides and the magneto-optical effect, resulting in a nonreciprocal propagation that can be optimized for optical isolation. This new concept shows promise in achieving a high-performing TE optical isolator, as it does not depend on resonance and is free from constraints associated with interferometers. Based on data from magneto-optical garnet materials, the simulated device has a length of 500 $\mu$m and its 20 dB-isolation bandwidth is as high as 35 nm.</description>

      <title>Gapping the spin-nodal planes of an anisotropic p-wave magnet to induce a large anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA: Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with a Fixed Set of "Virtual" Load-Tunable Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the scattering matrix of an arbitrarily complex linear, passive, time-invariant system with $N$ monomodal lumped ports by inputting and outputting waves only via a fixed set of $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while terminating the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports with tunable individual loads. First, we present a closed-form approach requiring at least three arbitrary, distinct, and known loads at each NDA port; sign ambiguities on off-diagonal scattering coefficients associated with NDA ports are inevitable. Being matrix-valued, our approach is ideally suited to mitigate noise sensitivity using more accessible ports. It also yields $1+2N_\mathrm{S}+N_S(N_S-1)/2$ as upper bound on the number of required measurements $N_\mathrm{cal}$ for $N_\mathrm{A}&gt;1$ in the low-noise regime. Second, we present a gradient-descent approach using random load configurations, enabling flexible adjustments of $N_\mathrm{cal}$ to further mitigate noise. Third, we present an intensity-only gradient-descent approach, dispensing with phase-sensitive detectors at the expense of an additional blockwise phase ambiguity. Then, we discuss in what applications the inevitable remaining ambiguities are problematic and how to lift them. Finally, we experimentally validate all three approaches with an eight-port reverberation chamber and $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, systematically assessing the sensitivity to noise and $N_\mathrm{cal}$. We coin our technique "virtual vector network analyzer (VNA)" because it implies that suitably tunable and characterized individual loads can essentially be interpreted as additional "virtual" VNA ports. Our method can characterize static large antenna systems with many and/or embedded ports, but also reconfigurable wave systems; it may further enable wireless sensing in indoor surveillance, non-destructive testing, and bioelectronics.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An experimental strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% is measured in a set of novel functional bilayer systems. We focus our work on studying the samples in an anechoic chamber under far-field real radar conditions. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with random anisotropy hexaferrite and soft metallic materials (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a submillimetric bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer permittivity, permeability, and thickness leading, therefore, to a strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ambient Drift and Negative-Bias Temperature Instability in Foundry Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Back-end-of-line (BEOL) logic integration is emerging as a complementary scaling path to supplement front-end-of-line (FEOL) Silicon. Among various options for BEOL logic, Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) have been integrated within commercial silicon foundries, and complex CNFET circuits (e.g., RISC-V core, SRAM arrays) have been demonstrated. However, there lacks comprehensive studies that analyze the ambient drift (i.e., air-stability) and reliability of CNFETs. Here, for the first time, we thoroughly characterize and demonstrate how to overcome ambient drift and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CNFETs using the following techniques: (1) Silicon Nitride encapsulation to limit ambient atmosphere induced threshold voltage shift (~8x reduction of median VT shift over 90 days) and (2) AC/pulsed operation to significantly improve CNFET NBTI vs. DC operation across a wide frequency range (e.g., 20% duty cycle AC operation at 10 MHz could extend CNFET NBTI time-to-failure by &gt;10000x vs. DC for a target VT shift tolerance &lt; 100 mV with gate stress bias VGS,stress = -1.2 V at 125 C).</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>
