      <title>Kalman Filter in the Problem of the Exchange and the Inflation Rates Adequacy To Determining Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using introduced concept of the exchange and inflation rates adequacy, the relevance of them to the determining factors is found. We established close positive relation between hryvnia / dollar exchange and inflation rates, fiscal deficit, price level of energy sources, and money supply. On this basis, we give proposals for state macroeconomic policy to stabilize Ukrainian economy.</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of identifying the best non-linear estimator of a given regression model involving a neural network using adversarially corrupted samples. We formulate this problem as a DRO problem and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the proposed robust SGLD algorithm. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the robust SGLD estimator outperforms the estimator obtained using vanilla SGLD in terms of test accuracy, which highlights the advantage of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising with perturbed samples.</description>

      <title>A class of locally state-dependent models for forward curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamic model for forward curves within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework under the Musiela parametrization. The forward curves take values in a function space H, and their dynamics follows a stochastic partial differential equation with state-dependent coefficients. In particular, the coefficients are defined through point-wise operating maps on H, resulting in a locally state-dependent structure. We first explore conditions under which these point-wise operators are well defined on H. Next, we determine conditions to ensure that the resulting coefficient functions satisfy local growth and Lipschitz properties, so to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions. The proposed model captures the behavior of the entire forward curve through a single equation, yet retains remarkable simplicity. Notably, we demonstrate that certain one-dimensional projections of the model are Markovian and satisfy a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation. This connects our Hilbert-space approach to well established models for forward contracts with fixed delivery times, for which existing formulas and numerical techniques can be applied. This link allows us to examine also conditions for maintaining positivity of the solutions. As concrete examples, we analyze Hilbert-space valued variants of an exponential model and of a constant elasticity of variance model.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the market-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price dynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.</description>
