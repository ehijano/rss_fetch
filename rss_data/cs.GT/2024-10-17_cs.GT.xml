      <title>EFX Orientations of Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair division of multigraphs with self-loops. In this setting, vertices represent agents and edges represent goods, and a good provides positive utility to an agent only if it is incident with the agent. Whereas previous research has so far only considered simple graphs, we consider the general setting of multigraphs, specifically focusing on the case in which each edge has equal utility to both incident agents, and edges have one of two possible utilities $\alpha &gt; \beta \geq 0$. In contrast with the case of simple graphs for which bipartiteness implies the existence of an EFX orientation, we show that deciding whether a symmetric multigraph $G$ of multiplicity $q \geq 2$ admits an EFX orientation is NP-complete even if $G$ is bipartite, $\alpha &gt; q\beta$, and $G$ contains a structure called a non-trivial odd multitree. Moreover, we show that non-trivial odd multitrees are a forbidden structure in the sense that even very simple non-trivial odd multitrees can fail to admit EFX orientations, and multigraphs that do not contain non-trivial odd multitrees always admit EFX orientations.</description>

      <title>Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auction is one of the most representative buying-selling systems. A celebrated study shows that the seller's expected revenue is equal in equilibrium, regardless of the type of auction, typically first-price and second-price auctions. Here, however, we hypothesize that when some auction environments vary with time, this revenue equivalence may not be maintained. In second-price auctions, the equilibrium strategy is robustly feasible. Conversely, in first-price auctions, the buyers must continue to adapt their strategies according to the environment of the auction. Surprisingly, we prove that revenue equivalence can be broken in both directions. First-price auctions bring larger or smaller revenue than second-price auctions, case by case, depending on how the value of an item varies. Our experiments also demonstrate revenue inequivalence in various scenarios, where the value varies periodically or randomly. This study uncovers a phenomenon, the breaking of revenue equivalence by the time-varyingness in auctions, that likely occurs in real-world auctions, revealing its underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing MMS for All but One Agent When Allocating Indivisible Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating $m$ indivisible chores to $n$ agents with additive cost functions under the fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). In this work, we propose a notion called $\alpha$-approximate all-but-one maximin share ($\alpha$-AMMS) which is a stronger version of $\alpha$-approximate MMS. An allocation is called $\alpha$-AMMS if $n-1$ agents are guaranteed their MMS values and the remaining agent is guaranteed $\alpha$-approximation of her MMS value. We show that there exist $\alpha$-AMMS allocations, with $\alpha = 9/8$ for three agents; $\alpha = 4/3$ for four agents; and $\alpha = (n+1)^2/4n$ for $n\geq 5$ agents.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria in scalar discrete-time linear quadratic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open problem in linear quadratic (LQ) games has been characterizing the Nash equilibria. This problem has renewed relevance given the surge of work on understanding the convergence of learning algorithms in dynamic games. This paper investigates scalar discrete-time infinite-horizon LQ games with two agents. Even in this arguably simple setting, there are no results for finding $\textit{all}$ Nash equilibria. By analyzing the best response map, we formulate a polynomial system of equations characterizing the linear feedback Nash equilibria. This enables us to bring in tools from algebraic geometry, particularly the Gr\"obner basis, to study the roots of this polynomial system. Consequently, we can not only compute all Nash equilibria numerically, but we can also characterize their number with explicit conditions. For instance, we prove that the LQ games under consideration admit at most three Nash equilibria. We further provide sufficient conditions for the existence of at most two Nash equilibria and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the tightness of our bounds and showcase the increased complexity in settings with more than two agents.</description>

      <title>Decline Now: A Combinatorial Model for Algorithmic Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drivers on food delivery platforms often run a loss on low-paying orders. In response, workers on DoorDash started a campaign, #DeclineNow, to purposefully decline orders below a certain pay threshold. For each declined order, the platform returns the request to other available drivers with slightly increased pay. While contributing to overall pay increase the implementation of the strategy comes with the risk of missing out on orders for each individual driver. In this work, we propose a first combinatorial model to study the strategic interaction between workers and the platform. Within our model, we formalize key quantities such as the average worker benefit of the strategy, the benefit of freeriding, as well as the benefit of participation. We extend our theoretical results with simulations. Our key insights show that the average worker gain of the strategy is always positive, while the benefit of participation is positive only for small degrees of labor oversupply. Beyond this point, the utility of participants decreases faster with increasing degree of oversupply, compared to the utility of non-participants. Our work highlights the significance of labor supply levels for the effectiveness of collective action on gig platforms. We suggest organizing in shifts as a means to reduce oversupply and empower collectives.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning and Free-riding in a Competitive Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative technique for training large-scale models while protecting user data privacy. Despite its substantial benefits, the free-riding behavior raises a major challenge for the formation of FL, especially in competitive markets. Our paper explores this under-explored issue on how the free-riding behavior in a competitive market affects firms' incentives to form FL. Competing firms can improve technologies through forming FL to increase the performance of their products, which in turn, affects consumers' product selection and market size. The key complication is whether the free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating firms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not discourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm wants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the competition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be profitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these interactions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the presence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal to contribute all its available information. Second, the firm with less amount of information always finds it profitable to free ride; whether its rival (with more amount of information) have an incentive to form FL only when the level of competition or when the gap in information volume is not high. Third, when FL is formed, there exists an "All-Win" situation in which all stakeholders (participating firms, consumers, and social planner) benefit. Last, subsidizing by the free-riding firm can align its rival's incentive to form FL only when the level of competition is intermediate.</description>

      <title>Prophet Upper Bounds for Online Matching and Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the online 2-bounded auction problem, we have a collection of items represented as nodes in a graph and bundles of size two represented by edges. Agents are presented sequentially, each with a random weight function over the bundles. The goal of the decision-maker is to find an allocation of bundles to agents of maximum weight so that every item is assigned at most once, i.e., the solution is a matching in the graph. When the agents are single-minded (i.e., put all the weight in a single bundle), we recover the maximum weight prophet matching problem under edge arrivals (a.k.a. prophet matching).
  In this work, we provide new and improved upper bounds on the competitiveness achievable by an algorithm for the general online 2-bounded auction and the (single-minded) prophet matching problems. For adversarial arrival order of the agents, we show that no algorithm for the online 2-bounded auction problem achieves a competitiveness larger than $4/11$, while no algorithm for prophet matching achieves a competitiveness larger than $\approx 0.4189$. Using a continuous-time analysis, we also improve the known bounds for online 2-bounded auctions for random order arrivals to $\approx 0.5968$ in the general case, a bound of $\approx 0.6867$ in the IID model, and $\approx 0.6714$ in prophet-secretary model.</description>

      <title>Voter Participation Control in Online Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News outlets, surveyors, and other organizations often conduct polls on social networks to gain insights into public opinion. Such a poll is typically started by someone on a social network who sends it to her friends. If a person participates in the poll, the poll information gets published on her wall, which in turn enables her friends to participate, and the process continues. Eventually, a subset of the population participates in the poll, and the pollster learns the outcome of that poll. We initiate the study of a new but natural type of election control in such online elections.
  We study how difficult/easy it is to sway the outcome of such polls in one's favor/against (aka constructive vs destructive) by any malicious influencer who nudges/bribes people for seemingly harmless actions like non-participation. These questions are important from the standpoint of studying the power of resistance of online voting against malicious behavior. The destructive version is also important to quantify the robustness of the winner of an online voting. We show that both problems are computationally intractable even if the election is over only two candidates and the influencer has an infinite amount of money to spend (that is, every voter can be persuaded to not participate). We strengthen this result by proving that the computational task remains substantially challenging even if the underlying network is a tree. Finally, we show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for the constructive version of the problem when we have O(1) candidates, and the treewidth of the underlying graph is O(1); the algorithm for the destructive version does not even need to assume O(1) number of candidates. Hence, we observe that the destructive version is computationally easier than the constructive version.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Meets Statistical Mechanics in Deep Learning Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep graphical representation that seamlessly merges principles of game theory with laws of statistical mechanics. It performs feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pattern classification within a single learning framework. Our approach draws an analogy between neurons in a network and players in a game theory model. Furthermore, each neuron viewed as a classical particle (subject to statistical physics' laws) is mapped to a set of actions representing specific activation value, and neural network layers are conceptualized as games in a sequential cooperative game theory setting. The feed-forward process in deep learning is interpreted as a sequential game, where each game comprises a set of players. During training, neurons are iteratively evaluated and filtered based on their contributions to a payoff function, which is quantified using the Shapley value driven by an energy function. Each set of neurons that significantly contributes to the payoff function forms a strong coalition. These neurons are the only ones permitted to propagate the information forward to the next layers. We applied this methodology to the task of facial age estimation and gender classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network models in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Battlefield Transfers in Coalitional Blotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation environments, agents often choose to form alliances; however, for some agents, doing so may not always be beneficial. Is there a method of forming alliances that always reward each of their members? We study this question using the framework of the coalitional Blotto game, in which two players compete against a common adversary by allocating their budgeted resources across disjoint sets of valued battlefields. On any given battlefield, the agent that allocates a greater amount of resources wins the corresponding battlefield value. Existing work has shown the surprising result that in certain game instances, if one player donates a portion of their budget to the other player, then both players win larger amounts in their separate competitions against the adversary. However, this transfer-based method of alliance formation is not always mutually beneficial, which motivates the search for alternate strategies. In this vein, we study a new method of alliance formation referred to as a joint transfer, whereby players publicly transfer battlefields and budgets between one another before they engage in their separate competitions against the adversary. We show that in almost all game instances, there exists a mutually beneficial joint transfer that strictly increases the payoff of each player.</description>

Abstract: Optimistic rollups are a popular and promising method of increasing the throughput capacity of their underlying chain. These methods rely on economic incentives to guarantee their security. We present a model of optimistic rollups that shows that the incentives are not aligned with the expected behavior of the players, thus potentially undermining the security of existing optimistic rollups. We discuss some potential solutions illuminated by our model.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer General Lotto game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the multiplayer General Lotto game across multiple battlefields, a significant variant of the Colonel Blotto game. In this version, each player employs a probability distribution for resource allocation, ensuring that their expected expenditure does not exceed their budget. We first establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium in a general setting, where players' budgets are asymmetric and the values of the battlefields are heterogeneous and asymmetric among players. Next, we provide a detailed characterization of the Nash equilibrium for multiple players on a single battlefield. In this characterization, we observe that the upper endpoints of the supports of players' equilibrium strategies coincide, and that the minimum value of a player's support above zero inversely correlates with his budget. We demonstrate the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium over a single battlefield in some scenarios. In the multi-battlefield setting, we prove that there is an upper bound on the average number of battlefields each player participates in. Additionally, we provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the context of multiple battlefields with multiple players. Finally, we present a solution for the Nash equilibrium in a symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Multi Agent Influence Diagrams for DeFi Governance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) governance models have become increasingly complex due to the involvement of numerous independent agents, each with their own incentives and strategies. To effectively analyze these systems, we propose using Multi Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs) as a powerful tool for modeling and studying the strategic interactions within DeFi governance. MAIDs allow for a comprehensive representation of the decision-making processes of various agents, capturing the influence of their actions on one another and on the overall governance outcomes. In this paper, we study a simple governance game that approximates real governance protocols and compute the Nash equilibria using MAIDs. We further outline the structure of a MAID in MakerDAO.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>

      <title>The Condorcet Dimension of Metric Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Condorcet winning set is a set of candidates such that no other candidate is preferred by at least half the voters over all members of the set. The Condorcet dimension, which is the minimum cardinality of a Condorcet winning set, is known to be at most logarithmic in the number of candidates. We study the case of elections where voters and candidates are located in a $2$-dimensional space with preferences based upon proximity voting. Our main result is that the Condorcet dimension is at most $3$, under both the Manhattan norm and the infinity norm, natural measures in electoral systems.</description>

      <title>AI, Pluralism, and (Social) Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One strategy in response to pluralistic values in a user population is to personalize an AI system: if the AI can adapt to the specific values of each individual, then we can potentially avoid many of the challenges of pluralism. Unfortunately, this approach creates a significant ethical issue: if there is an external measure of success for the human-AI team, then the adaptive AI system may develop strategies (sometimes deceptive) to compensate for its human teammate. This phenomenon can be viewed as a form of social compensation, where the AI makes decisions based not on predefined goals but on its human partner's deficiencies in relation to the team's performance objectives. We provide a practical ethical analysis of the conditions in which such compensation may nonetheless be justifiable.</description>

      <title>Consistent Conjectures in Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework to study stability notions for two-sided dynamic matching markets in which matching is one-to-one and irreversible. The framework gives center stage to the set of matchings an agent anticipates would ensue should they remain unmatched, which we refer to as the agent's conjectures. A collection of conjectures, together with a pairwise stability and individual rationality requirement given the conjectures, defines a solution concept for the economy. We identify a sufficient condition--consistency--for a family of conjectures to lead to a nonempty solution (cf. Hafalir, 2008). As an application, we introduce two families of consistent conjectures and their corresponding solution concepts: continuation-value-respecting dynamic stability, and the extension to dynamic markets of the solution concept in Hafalir (2008), sophisticated dynamic stability.</description>
