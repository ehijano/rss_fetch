      <title>A Liquid-Fueled Reactor Network Model for Enhanced NOx Prediction in Gas Turbine Combustors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a liquid-fueled reactor network (LFRN) framework for reduced-order modeling of gas turbine combustors. The proposed LFRN extends conventional gaseous-fueled reactor network methods by incorporating specialized reactors that account for spray breakup, droplet heating, and evaporation, thereby enabling the treatment of multiphase effects essential to liquid-fueled systems. Validation is performed against detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a liquid-fueled can combustor, with parametric studies conducted across variations in inlet air temperature and fuel flow rate. Results show that the LFRN substantially reduces NOx prediction errors relative to gaseous reactor networks while maintaining accurate outlet temperature predictions. A sensitivity analysis on the number of clusters demonstrates progressive convergence toward the CFD predictions with increasing network complexity. In terms of computational efficiency, the LFRN achieves runtimes on the order of 1-10 seconds on a single CPU core, representing speed-ups generally exceeding 2000\texttimes compared to CFD. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential of the LFRN as a computationally efficient reduced-order modeling tool that complements CFD to enable rapid emissions assessment and design-space exploration for liquid-fueled gas turbine combustors.</description>

      <title>The broken link between space and time in elastic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence (ET), observed in flows of sufficiently elastic polymer solution at small inertia, is characterized by chaotic motions and power-law scaling of energy spectrum ($E$) in both wavenumber ($k$) and frequency ($\omega$): $E(k) \sim k^{-\alpha}$ and $E(\omega) \sim \omega^{-\beta}$. Experiments of ET have obtained a vast range of values for the exponent $\beta$. In inertial turbulence, Taylor's frozen-flow hypothesis implies $\alpha = \beta$, i.e., spatial and temporal scales are linearly related to each other. In contrast, from high-resolution simulation in three different setups, a tri-periodic box, a channel, and a planar jet, we show that in ET $\alpha \approx 4$ while $\beta$ varies significantly. Our analysis shows that in general Taylor's hypothesis does not hold in ET as there is no universal relation, linear or otherwise, between space and time. Thus, we clear the confusion of the different scaling exponents found in ET, and focus the attention of future research on understanding $\alpha$. We introduce a fundamentally new way of looking not only at polymeric turbulence, but also at smooth chaotic flows in general, e.g., active turbulence.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Statistical Consistency in Synthetic Turbulence under Wavenumber Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random Fourier method (RFM) is widely employed for synthetic turbulence due to its mathematical clarity and simplicity. However, deviations remain between prescribed inputs and synthetic results, and the origin of these errors has not been fully evaluated. This study aims to systematically evaluate the effects of spectral coefficient calibration, grid constraints, and wavenumber bounds on the accuracy of RFM-generated turbulence. The results show that the recalibration of spectral coefficients is essential to ensure consistency in turbulent kinetic energy. The upper wavenumber bound, determined by grid resolution, controls the overall turbulent kinetic energy level, whereas the lower bound, set by computational domain size, governs the fidelity of the energy spectrum in the low-wavenumber range. Moreover, extending wavenumber bounds that exceed the grid-constrained bounds may improve turbulent kinetic energy accuracy but simultaneously amplifies spectral deviations. These findings clarify the distinct roles of coefficient calibration and wavenumber bounds in ensuring the statistical consistency of synthetic turbulence, providing practical guidance for selecting parameters in computational fluid dynamics and computational aeroacoustics applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of compressible isothermal turbulence from sub- to supersonic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of the Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local and scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density, velocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out hydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled $Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast, derivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the probability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density gradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails with growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently high $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level determined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited by viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic energy through a compressible form of the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found between subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling applies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more closely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms in the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an additional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales. Moreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour with increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and acting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Stable stratification enhances transient growth in streaky shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has found that the well-known `lift-up' mechanism is not important for, and may even inhibit, the transient growth possible on streaky wall-bounded shear flows which is believed an important process in the near-wall cycle for turbulent flows. Moreover, artificially removing the wall-normal velocity has been found to unleash 3 orders of magnitude more perturbation energy growth in an unbounded streaky flow model. Motivated by this, we examine the effect of introducing stable stratification which naturally suppresses wall-normal velocities (the `vertical' shear case) and find it permits the hugely enhanced linear energy growth predicted by simply removing the wall-normal velocity. Alternatively, imposing stable stratification such that the spanwise velocities are suppressed (`horizontal shear') not surprisingly inhibits transient growth by weakening the active `push over' mechanism. A formula for the critical stratification strength to completely suppress the preferred growth mechanism is determined which proves a useful predictor for what is seen in the full numerical solutions of the model. Implications for a stratified near-wall cycle are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonhomogeneous elastic turbulence in the two-dimensional Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence is a spatially and temporally disordered flow state appearing in viscoelastic fluids at vanishing fluid inertia and large elasticity. The resulting flows have broad technological interest, particularly to enhance mixing and heat transfer in microdevices. Although its experimental characterization is now well established in different setups, its theoretical understanding and numerical reproducibility remain challenging, especially in wall-bounded geometries. By means of extensive numerical simulations, we investigate the onset of elastic turbulence and the characteristics of the developed turbulent-like states in the two-dimensional, confined, Taylor-Couette system. We find that the purely elastic instability is supercritical, which clarifies previously contrasting evidences. We then show that the fully nonlinear dynamics are weakly anisotropic and strongly nonhomogeneous. Indeed, they are confined in a dynamically active region adjacent to the inner wall, akin to the elastic boundary layer from previous predictions. Within this region, the statistical and spectral turbulent properties are close to the theoretical expectations and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Wall-Modelled Large Eddy Simulation of Rotors using Homogenized Lattice Boltzmann Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the dynamic forces acting on rotors as well as their wake effects presents a significant challenge for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to high Reynolds numbers and a large range of spatio-temporal scales. The present work proposes a novel blade-resolved wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) approach based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).
  A homogenized hybrid regularized recursive collision scheme targeting the filtered Brinkman--Navier--Stokes equations is combined with a novel wall-model. This is implemented in the context of a platform-transparent framework for fluid-structure interaction in the open source LBM framework OpenLB.
  Convergence order and accuracy are validated against both experimental and numerical data for a model wind turbine, demonstrating excellent agreement for integral forces and wake velocity profiles. Computational efficiency and parallel scalability was investigated by roofline analysis and weak scaling studies for up to 384 rotors resolved by 41 billion lattice cells on the Karolina supercomputer.
  The proposed framework enables efficient blade-resolved WMLES of entire wind farms and offers a new methodology for other complex wall-modeled fluid-structure interaction applications.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport for wall shear stress fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical structure and the underlying energy budget of wall shear stress fluctuations are studied in both Poiseulle and Couette flows with emphasis on its streamwise component. Using a dimensional analysis and direct numerical simulation data, it is shown that the spectra of streamwise wall dissipation for $\lambda \lesssim 1000 \delta_\nu$ are asymptotically invariant with the Reynolds number ($Re$), whereas those for $\lambda \gtrsim \delta$ decay with $Re$ (here, $\lambda$ is a nominal wall-parallel wavelength, and $\delta_\nu$ and $\delta$ are the viscous inner and outer length scales, respectively). The wall dissipation increases with $Re$ due to the increasing contribution of the spectra at $1000 \delta_\nu \lesssim \lambda \lesssim \delta$. The subsequent analysis of the energy budget shows that the near-wall motions associated with these wall dissipation spectra are mainly driven by turbulent transport and are `inactive' in the sense that they contain very little Reynolds shear stress (or turbulence production). As such, turbulent transport spectra near the wall are also found to share the same $Re$-scaling behaviour with wall dissipation, and this is observed in the spectra of both the wall-normal and inter-scale turbulent transports. The turbulent transport underpinning the increase of wall dissipation with $Re$ is characterised by energy fluxes towards the wall, together with inverse energy transfer from small to large length scales along the wall-parallel directions.</description>

      <title>Gravity-driven viscous flow over partially lubricated bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the response of a viscous fluid flowing over a sloped bed across a spatially finite patch of basal lubrication. We present a simple analytical model that captures the fundamental structure of such lubrication-induced stress and velocity perturbations in Newtonian fluids, as well as scaling arguments and numerical experiments that extend our analysis to power-law fluids. These analyses concisely reveal the underlying relationships between the system parameters (fluid thickness, $h$, slope, $\alpha$, slippery patch length, $\ell$, and sliding condition outside of the slippery patch, $\gamma$) and the magnitude and spatial extent of the resulting perturbed stresses, $\tau_{xx}$, and velocities, $u_p$. From these results, we conclude that the induced stresses are exponentially decaying functions of distance away from the patch location, and show that the amplitude of the perturbations scales linearly with surface slope and patch length while the decay length scales with thickness and patch length, and is critically dependent on the basal boundary condition outside of the slippery patch. These fundamental relationships can be incorporated into more complex models to investigate whether rapid lake drainages on ice sheets, which create a partially lubricated bed, can generate sufficient stress and velocity perturbations in the overlying ice flow to trigger lake drainage cascades.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-free method for mean resolvent analysis of periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean resolvent operator predicts, in the frequency domain, the mean linear response to forcing. As such, it provides the optimal linear time-invariant approximation of the input-output dynamics of time-varying flows in the statistically steady regime (Leclercq &amp; Sipp 2023). In this paper, we introduce an adjoint-free projection-based method for mean resolvent analysis of periodic flows. To evaluate the convergence of the projection-based method against the subspace dimension, we also implement an adjoint-based approach based on the harmonic resolvent framework (Wereley &amp; Hall 1990, 1991; Padovan et al. 2020). Both adjoint-free and adjoint-based approaches may also be implemented in a matrix-free paradigm, using a time-stepper. For a weakly unsteady base flow, the mean-flow resolvent qualitatively approximates the dominant receptivity peak of the mean resolvent but completely fails to capture a secondary receptivity peak. For a strongly unsteady base flow, even the dominant receptivity peak of the mean resolvent associated with vortex-pairing is incorrectly captured by the mean-flow resolvent. The projection method already converges for a subspace dimension of 10 in the weakly unsteady case, but requires at least 100 modes for quantitative predictions in the strongly unsteady case. However, even in this case, using a subspace dimension of 1 is already enough to correctly identify the dominant receptivity peak.</description>

      <title>Influence of ambient temperature on cavitation bubble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of ambient temperature on the dynamics of spark-generated cavitation bubbles over a broad temperature range of 23 to 90$^\circ \text{C}$. Increasing temperature, the attenuation of collapse intensity of a bubble in a free field is quantitatively characterised through the Rayleigh factor, minimum bubble volume, and maximum collapse velocity. In scenarios where the bubble is initiated near a rigid boundary, this temperature-dependent weakening effect manifests further as a reduction in jet velocity and bubble migration. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that when ambient temperature exceeds 70$^\circ \text{C}$, secondary cavitation forms near the bubble surface around the moment of maximum bubble expansion, followed by coalescence-induced surface wrinkles. These perturbations trigger Rayleigh-Taylor instability and enhance bubble fission. We determine the internal gas pressure of the bubble at its maximum expansion via the Rayleigh-Plesset equation with the input of bubble radius from experimental measurements. It reveals that the secondary cavitation is derived from the gas pressure descending below the saturated vapor pressure, which provides nucleation-favorable conditions. This study sheds light on the physics behind erosion mitigation in high-temperature fluids from the perspective of cavitation bubble dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the results of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations, as well as observations of the full-disc solar magnetic field and sunspot number dynamics, it is demonstrated that cross-helicity can dominate the frequency power spectra of the magnetic field generated by a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo in chaotic/turbulent swirling flows. The theoretical consideration is based on a Kolmogorov-like phenomenology within the framework of the distributed chaos concept. It is shown that the solar full-disc magnetic field for the last two solar cycles with weak magnetic activity exhibits deterministic chaotic behavior concentrated around the equator. There is also observational indication that for the past periods of strong solar magnetic activity, there are two regimes of the smooth chaotic (but non-deterministic) cross-helical dynamo (high frequency and low frequency) separated by the 11-year phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Mean velocity profile in stably stratified turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) is a cornerstone of atmospheric science for describing turbulence in stable boundary layers. Extending MOST to stably stratified turbulent channel flows, however, is non-trivial due to confinement by solid walls and the much smaller turbulent length scales involved. In this study, we investigate the applicability of MOST in closed channels and identify where and to what extent the theory remains valid. A key finding is that the ratio of the half-channel height to the Obukhov length serves as a governing parameter for identifying distinct flow regions and determining the scaling of the mean velocity within them. Hence, we propose a closure relation to estimate this ratio directly from the governing input parameters: friction Reynolds and friction Richardson numbers ($Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$). The framework is tested against a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) across a range of $Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$. The reconstructed velocity profiles enable accurate prediction of the skin friction coefficient crucial for quantifying pressure losses in stratified flows in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Boundary Conditions for Flow, Convection-Diffusion and MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general derivation is proposed for several boundary conditions arisen in the lattice Boltzmann simulations of various physical problems. Pair-wise moment conservations are proposed to enforce the boundary conditions with given macroscopic quantities, including the velocity and pressure in flow simulations, concentration in convection-diffusion (CD) simulations, as well as magnetic field components in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. Additionally, the CD and MHD simulations might involve the Robin boundary condition for surface reactions and a Robin-like boundary condition for thin walls with finite electrical conductivities, respectively, both of which can be written in a form with a variable flux term. In this case, the proposed boundary scheme takes the flux term as an increment to the bounced distribution function and a reference frame transformation is used to obtain a correction term for moving boundaries. Spatial interpolation and extrapolation are used for arbitrary boundary locations between computational grid points. Due to using the same approach in derivations, the obtained boundary schemes for different physical processes in a coupled simulation are compatible for arbitrary boundary-to-grid distances (not limited to the popular half-grid boundary layout) and arbitrary moving speeds. Simulations using half-grid and full-grid boundary layouts for flat boundaries are conducted for demonstrations and validations. Moving boundaries are simulated in hydrodynamic and MHD flows, while static boundaries are used in the CD simulations with surface reactions. The numerical and analytical solutions are in excellent agreement in the studied cases. The proposed boundary schemes are also applied in simulating fully coupled MHD pipe flows of a curved boundary with various boundary-to-grid distances and excellent agreement with analytical solutions is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</description>
