      <title>A minimal model of the deep-convection lifecycle and its verification in remote-sensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep convection is one of the most important atmospheric transport mechanisms and associated with various severe weather phenomena. Manifestations of deep convection in the atmosphere are composed of a recurring fundamental building block, called cell, which evolves through a characteristic lifecycle. Despite its importance, no simple, physically consistent quantitative lifecycle model exists that correctly reproduces remote-sensing observations. Based on the standard conceptual model, we develop an analytic minimal model of the convection lifecycle in the form of coupled reaction rules. This reaction scheme is equivalent to a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations that qualitatively agree with the empirically known dynamics. In order to demonstrate quantitative agreement of our convection-lifecycle model, we construct a representative random sample of satellite and radar observations of deep-convection events over Germany. In particular, we introduce a conditional sampling strategy based on an objective timescale criterion to remove events not covered by our model from the random sample. We show that by this procedure, a definite and recurrent temporal signature of the convection lifecycle can be identified. Our model closely reproduces the principal characteristics while essentially staying within one standard deviation of the mean signature. Next to the definite relevance of our model for nowcasting, the approach may be useful for convection parametrisations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Flow Matching for Resolving Small-Scale Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditioning diffusion and flow models have proven effective for super-resolving small-scale details in natural images.However, in physical sciences such as weather, super-resolving small-scale details poses significant challenges due to: (i) misalignment between input and output distributions (i.e., solutions to distinct partial differential equations (PDEs) follow different trajectories), (ii) multi-scale dynamics, deterministic dynamics at large scales vs. stochastic at small scales, and (iii) limited data, increasing the risk of overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose encoding the inputs to a latent base distribution that is closer to the target distribution, followed by flow matching to generate small-scale physics. The encoder captures the deterministic components, while flow matching adds stochastic small-scale details. To account for uncertainty in the deterministic part, we inject noise into the encoder output using an adaptive noise scaling mechanism, which is dynamically adjusted based on maximum-likelihood estimates of the encoder predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on both the real-world CWA weather dataset and the PDE-based Kolmogorov dataset, with the CWA task involving super-resolving the weather variables for the region of Taiwan from 25 km to 2 km scales. Our results show that the proposed stochastic flow matching (SFM) framework significantly outperforms existing methods such as conditional diffusion and flows.</description>

      <title>Prototype-Based Methods in Explainable AI and Emerging Opportunities in the Geosciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prototype-based methods are intrinsically interpretable XAI methods that produce predictions and explanations by comparing input data with a set of learned prototypical examples that are representative of the training data. In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning Approaches for Predictions in Unmonitored Basins with Continental-scale Stream Temperature Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of streamflows and other environmental variables in unmonitored basins is a grand challenge in hydrology. Recent machine learning (ML) models can harness vast datasets for accurate predictions at large spatial scales. However, there are open questions regarding model design and data needed for inputs and training to improve performance. This study explores these questions while demonstrating the ability of deep learning models to make accurate stream temperature predictions in unmonitored basins across the conterminous United States. First, we compare top-down models that utilize data from a large number of basins with bottom-up methods that transfer ML models built on local sites, reflecting traditional regionalization techniques. We also evaluate an intermediary grouped modeling approach that categorizes sites based on regional co-location or similarity of catchment characteristics. Second, we evaluate trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and applicability for more target locations by systematically removing inputs. We then examine model performance when additional training data becomes available due to reductions in input requirements. Our results suggest that top-down models significantly outperform bottom-up and grouped models. Moreover, it is possible to get acceptable accuracy by reducing both dynamic and static inputs enabling predictions for more sites with lower model complexity and computational needs. From detailed error analysis, we determined that the models are more accurate for sites primarily controlled by air temperatures compared to locations impacted by groundwater and dams. By addressing these questions, this research offers a comprehensive perspective on optimizing ML model design for accurate predictions in unmonitored regions.</description>

      <title>Recommendations for Comprehensive and Independent Evaluation of Machine Learning-Based Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a revolutionary technology with demonstrable applications across multiple disciplines. Within the Earth science community, ML has been most visible for weather forecasting, producing forecasts that rival modern physics-based models. Given the importance of deepening our understanding and improving predictions of the Earth system on all time scales, efforts are now underway to develop forecasting models into Earth-system models (ESMs), capable of representing all components of the coupled Earth system (or their aggregated behavior) and their response to external changes. Modeling the Earth system is a much more difficult problem than weather forecasting, not least because the model must represent the alternate (e.g., future) coupled states of the system for which there are no historical observations. Given that the physical principles that enable predictions about the response of the Earth system are often not explicitly coded in these ML-based models, demonstrating the credibility of ML-based ESMs thus requires us to build evidence of their consistency with the physical system. To this end, this paper puts forward five recommendations to enhance comprehensive, standardized, and independent evaluation of ML-based ESMs to strengthen their credibility and promote their wider use.</description>

      <title>Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Informed Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-informed approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-informed approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Condition and Model Parameter Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03281v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference (FD) method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWEs) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation by parts (SBP) FD operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions (BCs) for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear vector invariant SWE in the subcritical regime, where energy is an entropy functional, we find that energy/entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove both nonlinear and local linear stability results, as well as a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWEs. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>
