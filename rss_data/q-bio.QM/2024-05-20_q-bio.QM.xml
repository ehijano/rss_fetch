      <title>Machine Learning Driven Biomarker Selection for Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental methods have enabled researchers to collect data on thousands of analytes simultaneously. This has led to correlational studies that associated molecular measurements with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Liver, and Gastric Cancer. However, the use of thousands of biomarkers selected from the analytes is not practical for real-world medical diagnosis and is likely undesirable due to potentially formed spurious correlations. In this study, we evaluate 4 different methods for biomarker selection and 4 different machine learning (ML) classifiers for identifying correlations, evaluating 16 approaches in all. We found that contemporary methods outperform previously reported logistic regression in cases where 3 and 10 biomarkers are permitted. When specificity is fixed at 0.9, ML approaches produced a sensitivity of 0.240 (3 biomarkers) and 0.520 (10 biomarkers), while standard logistic regression provided a sensitivity of 0.000 (3 biomarkers) and 0.040 (10 biomarkers). We also noted that causal-based methods for biomarker selection proved to be the most performant when fewer biomarkers were permitted, while univariate feature selection was the most performant when a greater number of biomarkers were permitted.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict Mutation Effects of Protein-Protein Interactions by Microenvironment-aware Hierarchical Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-protein bindings play a key role in a variety of fundamental biological processes, and thus predicting the effects of amino acid mutations on protein-protein binding is crucial. To tackle the scarcity of annotated mutation data, pre-training with massive unlabeled data has emerged as a promising solution. However, this process faces a series of challenges: (1) complex higher-order dependencies among multiple (more than paired) structural scales have not yet been fully captured; (2) it is rarely explored how mutations alter the local conformation of the surrounding microenvironment; (3) pre-training is costly, both in data size and computational burden. In this paper, we first construct a hierarchical prompt codebook to record common microenvironmental patterns at different structural scales independently. Then, we develop a novel codebook pre-training task, namely masked microenvironment modeling, to model the joint distribution of each mutation with their residue types, angular statistics, and local conformational changes in the microenvironment. With the constructed prompt codebook, we encode the microenvironment around each mutation into multiple hierarchical prompts and combine them to flexibly provide information to wild-type and mutated protein complexes about their microenvironmental differences. Such a hierarchical prompt learning framework has demonstrated superior performance and training efficiency over state-of-the-art pre-training-based methods in mutation effect prediction and a case study of optimizing human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.</description>

      <title>Comparative prospects of imaging methods for whole-brain mammalian connectomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes are a crucial ingredient for holistic understanding of brain function. Imaging these connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Although the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly enough that the mouse brain might be within reach in the near future. Human connectomes remain a more distant goal. Here, we quantitatively compare existing and emerging imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion microscopy coupled with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques from the literature that have sufficiently high resolution to identify all synapses and sufficiently high speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. Each imaging modality comes with benefits and drawbacks, so we suggest that attacking the problem through multiple approaches could yield the best outcomes. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.</description>
