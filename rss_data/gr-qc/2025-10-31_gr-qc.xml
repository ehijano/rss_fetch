      <title>Dark Energy Contaminated Black Hole Solution: A Drive Through the Thermodynamic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black hole mass within a cosmological background modeled by a Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) under various dark energy equation of state parametrizations, including Linear, Logarithmic, CPL, JBP, FSLL-II, and Barboza--Alcaniz (BA) models. The logarithmic mass ratio $\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent evolution of $\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic, and CPL models indicating quasi-static accretion, steep slopes in JBP corresponding to rapid late-time variations, and non-monotonic behaviour in FSLL-II and BA highlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive dark energy effects. Peaks, minima, and amplitude offsets in the mass ratio reflect the dynamic interplay between horizon thermodynamics, the evolving pressure of the MCG, and cosmic expansion, illustrating how the black hole mass growth is directly influenced by both the temporal evolution of dark energy and the effective gravitational potential of the surrounding cosmic fluid. Our results demonstrate that black hole accretion acts as a sensitive probe of the time-dependent cosmic pressure landscape and provides physical insights into the coupling between local strong gravity and global accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff implies Quasi-topological</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-topological gravities (QTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of Einstein gravity in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. Throughout the years, different notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial curvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we show that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent notions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a single-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type II QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric backgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the field equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II QTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II QTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess second-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to prove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that the reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For every theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically symmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime characterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>Beyond general relativity: gravitational waves in non-minimally coupled theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy from a Polynomial Expansion in the Hubble Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) model defined by a polynomial expansion in the Hubble parameter, incorporating the first three leading terms proportional to $H^{2}$, $H^{4}$, and $H^{6}$ through a variable parameter in the expression for the energy density. The analysis is developed within the framework of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe composed of non-interacting matter and this HDE fluid. We derive the complete set of Friedmann equations to study the cosmic evolution and subsequently examine the system for the existence of thermodynamic $P-V$ type phase transitions. Finally, a comprehensive comparison with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is presented.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quasinormal modes, grey-body factors and absorption cross-section of the black hole immersed in the Hernquist galactic halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark-matter halo. The quasinormal spectrum is obtained through the higher-order WKB method and verified by time-domain evolution, showing consistent results. The field mass increases the oscillation frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum. The grey-body factors reveal a suppression of low-frequency transmission and a displacement of their main features toward higher frequencies, resulting in a corresponding shift in the absorption cross-section.</description>

      <title>Spin effects on particle creation and evaporation in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study how the spin of particle modes influences particle creation, greybody factors, absorption, and evaporation of a black hole within the framework of modified electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity, recently proposed in Ref. [1]. All spin sectors -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial -- are analyzed to obtain the corresponding features. For particle creation, we consider massless bosonic and fermionic perturbations to determine the respective particle densities. Analytical expressions for the greybody factors are derived, with suitable approximations for the tensor and spinorial cases. The absorption cross section is computed numerically, and using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we estimate the black hole evaporation lifetime. The associated energy and particle emission rates are also discussed, along with the correspondence between quasinormal modes and greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Beyond GRMHD: A Robust Numerical Scheme for Extended, Non-Ideal General Relativistic Multifluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity. We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either accuracy or stability.</description>

      <title>Mapping Anisotropies in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with space detector networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as TianQin, LISA, and Taiji are expected to conduct joint observations. Such a multi-detector network will provide complementary viewing angles for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), thereby significantly enhancing the capability to reconstruct and localize its spatial distribution. In this paper, we have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB. The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $, which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Breaking Eternal Inflation: Empirical Viability of a Spontaneous Collapse Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an inflationary scenario in which primordial inhomogeneities arise from a quantum collapse, a stochastic mechanism described in the context of quantum collapse theories in its continuous version and within semiclassical gravity. The predictions of the model show a non-conventional scalar spectrum governed by two new parameters in the collapse rate, whose aim is twofold: on one side, to account for the primordial cosmic structure, and on the other to explain the suppression amplitude associated with long-wavelength modes, thereby eliminating the occurrence of eternal inflation. Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\ell$ suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the Planck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other words, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the cosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider versions of the Penrose singularity theorem and the Hawking horizon topology theorem in weighted spacetimes that contain weighted versions of trapped surfaces, for arbitrary spacetime dimension and synthetic dimension. We find that suitable generalizations of the unweighted theorems hold under a weighted null energy condition. Our results also provide further evidence in favour of a weighted scalar curvature that differs from the trace of the weighted Ricci curvature. When the synthetic dimension is a positive integer, these weighted curvatures have a natural interpretation in terms of warped product metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of black holes have been extensively studied through analogies with classical systems, revealing fundamental connections between gravitation, entropy, and quantum mechanics. In this work, we extend the thermodynamic framework of black holes by incorporating charge and analyzing its role in entropy production. Using an analogy with charged rotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total angular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer, revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance. These findings reinforce the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes and provide insights into the interplay between charge, rotation, and entropy in gravitational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although well-studied at the level of perturbative scattering in vacuum, far less is known about non-perturbative aspects or extensions of the double copy beyond trivial backgrounds. We show here how Hawking radiation in a collapse metric, its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the double copy of particle production in a background gauge field, where there is no global horizon, nor a thermal spectrum. Our approach combines worldline and amplitudes methods, and allows the unification of several classical and quantum double copy prescriptions for black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the resolution of spacetime singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens at spacetime singularities is poorly understood. The Penrose-Wall singularity theorem constrains possible scenarios, but until recently its key assumption--the generalized second law (GSL)--had only been proven perturbatively, severely limiting this application. We highlight that recent progress enables a proof of the GSL in holographic brane-world models, valid non-perturbatively at the species scale $cG$ (with $c$ the number of matter fields and $G$ Newton's constant). This enables genuine constraints: an outer-trapped surface in the Einstein gravity regime implies geodesic incompleteness non-perturbatively at the species scale. Conversely, any genuine resolution must evade Penrose's criteria. We illustrate both possibilities with explicit examples: the classical BTZ black hole evolves to a more severe singularity, while a null singularity on the Rindler horizon is resolved, both by species-scale effects. Subject to the GSL, these constraints on singularity resolution apply beyond brane-worlds: namely, in any theory with a geometric UV scale--roughly, where the metric remains well-defined but classical Einstein gravity breaks down.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Pressure Anisotropy via Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars may exhibit pressure anisotropy arising from various physical mechanisms, such as elasticity, magnetic fields, viscosity, and superfluidity. We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

Abstract: We derive new families of quantum null energy inequalities (QNEIs), i.e. bounds on integrated null energy, in quantum field theories in two and higher dimensions. These are universal, state-independent lower bounds on semi-local integrals of $\langle T_{vv} \rangle$, the energy-momentum flux in a null direction, and the first of this kind for interacting theories in higher dimensions. Our ingredients include the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropies, defect operator expansions, and the vacuum modular Hamiltonians of null intervals and strips. These results are fundamental constraints on null energy in quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$vCF: Extending $\Lambda$CDM into a Unified Model with Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel extended version of the $\Lambda$CDM model that provides analytical solution for Hubble parameter uniting all epochs of cosmic evolution starting from inflation to late-acceleration, with intermediate radiation and matter-dominated epochs. This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\approx10^{13}$\,GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit. Finally, by comparing the evolution of this causal relation and its Navier-Stokes counterpart, we infer that the evolution from inflation to radiation era signifies a fluid transitioning from viscoelastic to pseudoplastic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dual formulations of an infinite tower of tree-level soft theorems in asymptotically flat spacetimes for scattering amplitudes in the standard energy-momentum basis and for correlators of a 2D celestial conformal field theory imply a correspondence between the celestial operator product expansion (OPE) and the higher spin charge bracket. We apply such correspondence to provide first a prescription to solve the double-soft limit ambiguity in the mixed-helicity sector of celestial OPEs. Furthermore, demanding the charge OPE/bracket correspondence to remain valid when operators are shadow transformed, we construct an algorithm to compute shadow celestial OPEs. We first test the algorithm by recovering results in the previous literature involving the celestial energy-momentum tensor; we then apply it to both gravity and Yang-Mills theory and generalize the OPE derivation to arbitrary spins.</description>

      <title>Localization and anomalous reference frames in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the classical phase space for the gravitational degrees of freedom along a null ray. We construct gauge-invariant observables localized on a null ray segment that commute with those localized on the complement; thus, the phase space describes a genuine gravitational subsystem compatible with both locality and diffeomorphism invariance. Our construction employs 'dressing time' (a null time coordinate built from spin 0 gravitational degrees of freedom) as a dynamical reference frame. The existence of such a frame depends on the use of edge mode variables, which we argue are generally required to upgrade a local gauge-fixing condition to a global 'frame-fixing'. To analyze the effects of quantum diffeomorphism anomalies on these structures, we then establish an 'effective' classical description in which the Raychaudhuri equation, symplectic form, and edge mode variables all acquire Virasoro-type deformations. Within this framework, we identify three distinct diffeomorphism actions: reparametrizations (gauge transformations), reorientations (physical symmetries of the reference frame), and dressed reparametrizations. Each acquires its own central extension and plays a different crucial role in the effective theory. The resulting structures provide a foundation for quantizing gravitational null ray segments, including promoting dressing time to a genuine quantum reference frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0, 1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0 perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of 4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

Abstract: We will analyze through a first order perturbative formulation the local loss of symmetry when a source of non-Abelian Yang-Mills and gravitational fields interacts with an external agent that perturbes the original geometry associated to the source. Then, as the symmetry in Abelian and non-Abelian field structures in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes is displayed through the existence of local planes of symmetry that we previously called blades one and two. These orthogonal local planes diagonalize the stress-energy tensor and every vector in these planes is an eigenvector of the stress-energy tensor. The loss of symmetry will be manifested by the tilting of these planes under the influence of the external agent. It was also found already that there is an algorithm to block diagonalize the Yang-Mills field strength in a local gauge invariant way. The loss of symmetry will also be manifested by the tilting of these planes that block diagonalize the Yang-Mills field strength under the influence of the external agent. As the interaction proceeds, the planes will tilt perturbatively, and in this strict sense the original local symmetry will be lost. But we will prove that the new orthogonal planes or blades at the same point will correspond after the tilting generated by perturbation to a new symmetry, with associated new local currents, both on each new local planes of symmetry. Old symmetries will be broken, new symmetries will arise. There will be a local symmetry evolution in the non-Abelian case as well. This result will produce a new theorem on dynamic symmetry evolution. This new classical model will be useful in order to better understand anomalies in quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that quantum groups are relevant to describe the quantum regime of 3d gravity. They encode a deformation of the gauge symmetries parametrized by the value of the cosmological constant. They appear as a form of regularization either through the quantization of the Chern-Simons formulation or the state sum approach of Turaev-Viro. Such deformations are perplexing from a continuum and classical picture since the action is defined in terms of undeformed gauge invariance. We present here a novel way to derive from first principle and from the classical action such quantum group deformation. The argument relies on two main steps. First we perform a canonical transformation, which deformed the gauge invariance and the boundary symmetries, and makes them depend on the cosmological constant. Second we implement a discretization procedure relying on a truncation of the degrees of freedom from the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precessing binary black-hole mergers can produce a net flux of circularly-polarized gravitational waves. This imbalance between left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, quantified via the Stokes pseudo-scalar $V_{\rm GW}$, originated from mirror asymmetries in the binary. We scan the parameter space of black-hole mergers to investigate correlations between $V_{\rm GW}$ and chiral magnitudes constructed out of the intrinsic parameters of the binary. To this end, we use both numerical-relativity simulations for (quasi-circular) and eccentric precessing mergers from both the SXS and RIT catalogues, as well as the state-of-the-art surrogate model for quasi-circular precessing mergers NRSur7dq4. We find that, despite being computed by manifestly different formulas, $V_{\rm GW}$ is linearly correlated to the helicity of the final black hole, defined as the projection of its recoil velocity onto its spin. Next, we test our ability to perform accurate measurements of $V_{\rm GW}$ in gravitational-wave observations through the injection and recovery of numerically simulated signals. We show that $V_{\rm GW}$ can be estimated unbiasedly using the surrogate waveform model NRSur7dq4 even for signal-to-noise ratios of nearly 50, way beyond current gravitational-wave observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in an extreme mass ratio inspiral system, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. Firstly, by using the effective potential, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits are investigated. It is found that the radius, orbital angular momentum, and energy increase with the hair parameter for both orbits. Based on these results, we examine one special type of orbit, the periodic orbit, around the black hole without the Cauchy horizon. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. In particular, we observe a significant deviation from the Schwarzschild case for small hair parameter with a large amount of external mass outside the black hole horizon. Moreover, we examine the waveforms in the extreme mass ratio inspiral system to explore the orbital information of the periodic orbits and the constraints on the parameters of the black holes. The results reveal that the gravitational waveforms can fully capture the zoom-whirl behavior of periodic orbits. Moreover, the phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central supermassive black hole without a Cauchy horizon.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Deviation of Kerr Metric via Bumpy Parameterization and Particle Swarm Optimization in Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy" spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be given in completely distinct forms in different coordinate systems. Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates transformation that connects the two metrics.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of electromagnetically sourced nonlinear tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic events in the astrophysical environment are typically high energetic, potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Spherical Accretion on a Schwarzschild-MOG Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have examined spherical accretion onto Schwarzschild MOG Black Holes within the framework of Modified Gravity. Using isothermal test fluids, we analyze the behavior of the flow near the critical (sonic) point for various values of the equation of state parameter $k$. Depending on the fluid type, the flow exhibits either subsonic or supersonic behavior, with ultra-stiff and ultra-relativistic fluids allowing both regimes, while radiation and sub-relativistic fluids show more restricted dynamics. Phase space analysis helps visualize these transitions. We also compute the mass accretion rate and find that it increases with both radial distance and the MOG parameter $\alpha$, highlighting the role of modified gravity in enhancing accretion processes around black holes</description>

      <title>Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</description>

      <title>Entropy of de Sitter (d+1)-spacetime: modification of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of cosmological horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the connection between the entropy of the Hubble volume in de Sitter spacetime and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm GH}=A/4G$ associated with the cosmological horizon. In (3+1) spacetime, these two entropies coincide, and hence the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture holds. This provides physical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it is the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we consider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter state in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter thermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\pi$. This temperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local activation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter environment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local temperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. Two different ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were considered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and the first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the entropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon. The original form of the Gibbons-Hawking is valid only for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Effective action for $\phi^4$-Yukawa theory via 2PI formalism in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction, Yukawa coupled to fermions in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime background. The scalar has a classical background plus quantum fluctuations, whereas the fermions are taken to be quantum. We derive for this system the effective action and the effective potential via the two particle irreducible (2PI) formalism. This formalism provides an opportunity to find out resummed or non-perturbative expressions for some series of diagrams. We have considered the two loop vacuum graphs and have computed the local part of the effective action. The various resummed counterterms corresponding to self energies, vertex functions and the tadpole have been explicitly found out. The variation of the renormalised effective potential for massless fields has been investigated numerically. We show that for the potential to be bounded from below, we must have $\lambda \gtrsim 16 g^2$, where $\lambda$ and $g$ are respectively the quartic and Yukawa couplings. We emphasise the qualitative differences of this non-perturbative calculation with that of the standard 1PI perturbative ones in de Sitter. The qualitative differences of our result with that of the flat spacetime has also been pointed out.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks ($q$) and gluons ($g$) mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, characterized by the Mandelstam variable $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$, which corresponds to the total energy squared in the center-of-momentum frame, being much larger than any particle mass scale, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \to gg$, $gg \to q\bar{q}$, $gq \to gq$, and $qq \to qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. {In this work, we obtain a high-confidence measurement of the neutrino mass within a dynamical DE framework. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a measurement for a non-zero, positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This high-confidence measurement is driven mainly by these factors: (i) the DESI's preference for a dynamical DE with its equation of state evolving from $w&lt; -1$ at early times to $w&gt; -1$ at late times, thus leading to a larger neutrino mass; (ii) treating $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a free parameter together with the inclusion of weak lensing data, which likewise allows for an increased neutrino mass.} In future, even higher-confidence measurements of neutrino mass are expected with stronger preferences for dynamical DE in light of more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS hypermultiplets in harmonic superspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -12 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x^5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>

Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

      <title>One-loop double copy from gravity coupled to a massive vector field</title>

Abstract: In this work, we compute the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes with a massive abelian vector field (Proca) circulating in the loop. Instead of the conventional Einstein-Hilbert formulation, we employ the Landau-Lifshitz metric density approach, coupling gravity to the Proca field. Within this framework, we found that the resulting contact-terms-free $n$-gon numerators exhibit a manifest double-copy structure, provided the external gravitational trees satisfy this property. This structure enables the direct construction of the corresponding amplitudes with a scalar in the loop. We further show that these numerators can be consistently used to evaluate pure gravity amplitudes in the sectors where contact terms vanish, offering a simplified setting to explore double-copy relations at one loop level.</description>

      <title>Fermionic fields of higher spin in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>
