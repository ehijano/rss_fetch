      <title>Quantum Theory of Optical Spin Texture in Chiral Tellurium Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Electronic Origin of Anomalous Contact Conductance in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the contact conductance in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), providing a theoretical explanation for recent experimental observations from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM). These experiments revealed a surprising non-monotonic current pattern as a function of the TBG rotation angle $\theta$, with a peak at $\theta \approx 5^\circ$, a finding that markedly departs from the well-known magic angle TBG behavior. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework. Our calculations, performed on both relaxed and rigid TBG structures, simulate contact conductance by analyzing the local density of states across a range of biases and rotational angles. Contrary to the current interpretation, our results demonstrate that the maximum conductance at $\theta \approx 5^{\rm o}$ is not caused by structural relaxation or AA stacking zone changes. Instead, we attribute this peak to the evolution of the electronic band structure, specifically the shifting of van Hove singularities (vHs) to the Fermi level as the twist angle decreases. We further show that the precise location of this conductance maximum is dependent on the applied bias voltage. This interplay between twist angle, bias, and vHs energy provides a robust explanation for the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Generic Platform for Designing Fractional Chern Insulators: Electrostatically Engineered Rashba Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22173v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generic platform for designing topological flat bands through applying an artificially designed electrostatic superlattice potential to a thin film with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing many-body exact diagonalization, we show that the lowest flat band can host fractional Chern insulator states at filling factor $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$. Notably, these fractional charge states present robustly in a broad regime of the parameter space. We further discuss the potential realistic materials and the associated experimental conditions required to realize these compelling theoretical predictions. Our findings establish a versatile platform for engineering topological flat bands and exploring topologically nontrivial correlated states.</description>

      <title>Ultra-small Mode Volume Polariton Condensation via Precision $He^+$ Ion Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ &lt; 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Microscopic approach to the quantized light-matter interaction in semiconductor nanostructures: Complex coupled dynamics of excitons, biexcitons, and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz time-domain signatures of the inverse Edelstein effect in topological-insulator|ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological insulators possess topologically protected surface states with spin-momentum locking, which enable spin-charge-current interconversion (SCI) by the inverse Edelstein effect (IEE). However, it remains experimentally challenging to separate the surface-related IEE from the bulk-type inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). Here, we search for distinct time-domain signatures of the two SCI phenomena in a $\mathcal{F}$|TI model stack of a ferromagnetic-metal layer $\mathcal{F}$ (Co and Fe) and a topological-insulator layer TI (Bi$_2$Te$_3$, SnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.3), where the focus is on Bi$_2$Te$_3$. A femtosecond laser pulse serves to induce a transient spin voltage $\mu_s^{\mathcal{F}}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ and, thus, drive an ultrafast spin current out of $\mathcal{F}$. SCI results in a transverse charge current with a sheet density $I_c$ that is detected by sampling the emitted terahertz electric field. Analysis of the dynamics of $I_c(t)$ vs time $t$ relative to $\mu_s^{\mathcal{F}}(t)$ reveals two components with distinct time scales: (i) a quasi-instantaneous response and (ii) a longer-lived response with a relaxation time of 270 fs, which is independent of the chosen $\mathcal{F}$ material. Component (i) is consistently ascribed to the ISHE. In contrast, we interpret component (ii) as a signature of interfacial spin accumulation and the IEE at the $\mathcal{F}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ interface, with a fraction of $&lt; 10^{-2}$ of the incident spins participating. This assignment is fully consistent with respect to its dynamics and magnitude. We rate other possible signal contributions, such as spin trapping in intermediate states, as less likely. Our results show that the femtosecond dynamics of photocurrents provide important insights into the mechanisms of spin transport and SCI in $\mathcal{F}$|TI stacks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermoelectric effects in a driven one-dimensional system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a one-dimensional quantum system in the presence of an external driving. We employ Floquet scattering theory to calculate linear-response stationary thermoelectric figures of merit in a single-channel conductor subjected to a periodically varying delta-like potential barrier. We include a step barrier in one of the leads as a model of a nanoscale inhomogeneous semiconducting system. In the absence of a step barrier, we found that the external driving can strongly enhance the Seebeck coefficient, particularly at low temperatures, with a relative increase with respect to the static condition reaching up to 200% at large frequencies. In the presence of a step barrier, we found that the thermoelectric Onsager coefficient for the driven case is also enhanced with respect to the static case with a significant effect at low temperatures when the chemical potential is within the gap of the semiconductor. Our results demonstrate that external driving can be used to tune and enhance the thermoelectric capabilities of low-electron-density nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Modeling the g-factors, hyperfine interaction and optical properties of semiconductor QDs: the atomistic and eight-band $k \cdot p$ approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing. These qubits have been predicted to show extremely low error rates due to topological protection of the MZMs, where decoherence processes have been thought to be exponentially suppressed by either the nanowire length or the temperature. However, here we show that 1/f noise, which is ubiquitous in semiconductors, gives rise to a previously unexplored mechanism for Majorana qubit decoherence. The high frequency components of this noise causes quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which in turn result in qubit errors that increase with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the probability of quasiparticle excitation for disorder-free nanowires in the presence of 1/f noise and show that this mechanism limits the decoherence times of the MZM qubits currently being developed to less than a microsecond even for perfectly uniform nanowires with no disorder. This decoherence time is significantly shorter than the time to implement quantum gates using this technology and is also shorter than the decoherence times of qubits in other leading solid-state architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometric dipole: a topological boost to flavor ferromagnetism in flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust flavor-polarized phases are a striking hallmark of many flat-band moir\'e materials. In this work, we trace the origin of this spontaneous polarization to a previously overlooked quantum-geometric quantity: the quantum-geometric dipole. Analogous to how the quantum metric governs the spatial spread of wavepackets, we show that the quantum-geometric dipole sets the characteristic size of particle-hole excitations, e.g. magnons in a ferromagnet, which in turn boosts their gap and stiffness. Indeed, the larger the particle-hole separation, the weaker the mutual attraction, and the stronger the excitation energy. In topological bands, this energy enhancement admits a lower bound within the single-mode approximation, highlighting the crucial role of topology in flat-band ferromagnetism. We illustrate these effects in microscopic models, emphasizing their generality and relevance to moir\'e materials. Our results establish the quantum-geometric dipole as a predictive geometric indicator for ferromagnetism in flat bands, a crucial prerequisite for topological order.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnon Spintronics: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Electron Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treating the electron as a charged spinon we propose a theory of magnon spintronics, a non-Abelian gauge theory of SU(2)xU(1), which could be viewed as an effective theory of electron spintronics. Just like QED the theory has the U(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new ingredient is the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon with the spinon. A remarkable feature of the theory is the photon-magnon mixing, the mixing between the electromagnetic U(1) gauge boson and the diagonal part of the SU(2) magnon gauge boson. After the mixing we have the massless Abelian magnon and a massive photon, and the doubly charged massive off-diagonal non-Abelian magnons which induce the spin-flip interaction to the spinon. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different penetration lengths, the one fixed by the mass of the photon which generates the well known Meissner effect and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnons which generates the non-Abelian Meissner effect. The non-Abelian structure of the theory naturally accommodates new topological objects, the non-Abrikosov quantized magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole of the Cho-Maison type, as well as the well known Abrikosov vortex. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theory of the magnon spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to map kinetic theories for spinning particles in curved space to flat space through choice of inertial frame that eliminate forces acting on momentum and spin, thus putting the idea of mimicking off-equilibrium state by metric perturbation to equilibrium state on firm ground. The equivalence has been shown for hydrodynamic and elastic regimes. In the latter case, we predict spin polarization induced by time-variation of strain in elastic matter.</description>

      <title>Scalable Etch-Free Transfer of Low-Dimensional Materials from Metal Films to Diverse Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO_2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 10^3. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Penetration of Edge Properties in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edges are essential for the mechanical, chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Research has shown that features assigned to edges are not strictly localized but often penetrate the bulk to some degree. However, mechanical edge properties, such as edge energies and stresses, are typically assigned at the system level, with spatial bulk penetrations that remain unknown. Here, we use density-functional tight-binding simulations to study how deep various edge properties spatially penetrate the 2D bulk. We study nine different edges made of four materials: graphene, goldene, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide. By investigating edge energies, edge stresses, and edge elastic moduli, we find that although the edge properties typically originate near edges, they still penetrate the bulk to some degree. An utmost example is goldene with a staggered edge, whose edge properties penetrate the bulk nanometer-deep. Our results caution against associating system-level edge properties too strictly with the edge, especially if those properties are further used in continuum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have properties attractive for applications, but they are intrinsically unstable and require delicate stabilization in pores or other nano-constrictions. Substrates provide solid support, but metallenes' wanted properties can only be retained in weak physisorption. Here, we study the 45 physisorbed, atomically thin metallene structures in flat and buckled lattices using a sequential multi-scale model based on density-functional theory calculations. The lattices are mostly buckled but flat for a handful of elements such as Na, K, Rb, Ag, Au, and Cd, depending on physisorption strength. Moreover, under certain conditions, the structure can be controlled by applying biaxial tensile stress parallel or an electric field normal to the surface. The stress reduces the threshold of adhesion strength required to flatten a buckled lattice, and the electric field can be used to increase that threshold controllably. Our results help provide fundamental information about the structures of physisorbed metallenes and suggest means to control them at will by suitable substrate choice or tuning of experimental parameters.</description>

Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-Tc YBCO superconducting waveguides with 100-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies at different temperatures and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22325v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Traditional topological materials belong to different Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes (AZSCs) depending on their non-spatial symmetries. Here we introduce the notion of hybrid symmetry class topological insulators (HSCTIs): A fusion of two different AZSC topological insulators (TIs) such that they occupy orthogonal Cartesian hyperplanes and their universal massive Dirac Hamiltonian mutually anticommute, a mathematical procedure we name hybridization. The boundaries of HSCTIs can also harbor TIs, typically affiliated with an AZSC that is different from the ones for the parent two TIs. As such, a fusion or hybridization between planar class AII quantum spin Hall and vertical class BDI Su-Schrieffer-Heeger insulators gives birth to a three-dimensional class A HSCTI, accommodating quantum anomalous Hall insulators (class A) of opposite Chern numbers and quantized Hall conductivity of opposite signs on the top and bottom surfaces. Such a response is shown to be stable against weak disorder. We extend this construction to encompass crystalline HSCTI and topological superconductors (featuring half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity of opposite sings on the top and bottom surfaces), and beyond three spatial dimensions. Non-trivial responses of three-dimensional HSCTIs to crystal defects (namely edge dislocations) in terms of mid-gap bound states at zero energy around its core only on the top and bottom surfaces are presented. Possible (meta)material platforms to harness and engineer HSCTIs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a topological phenomenon, resulting in the condensation of bulk modes near the boundaries. Due to the localization of bulk modes at the edges, boundary effects remain significant even in the thermodynamic limit. This makes conventional Bloch band theory inapplicable and hinders the accurate computation of the spectrum. The Amoeba formulation addresses this problem by determining the potential from which the spectrum can be derived using the generalized Szeg\"o's limit theorem, reducing the problem to an optimization of the Ronkin function. While this theory provides novel insights into non-Hermitian physics, challenges arise from the multiband nature and symmetry-protected degeneracies, even in one-dimensional cases. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional two-band class AII$^\dagger$ systems, where Kramers pairs invalidate the conventional Amoeba formalism. We find that these challenges can be overcome by optimizing the band-resolved Ronkin functions, which is achieved by extrapolating the total Ronkin function. Finally, we propose a generalized Szeg\"o's limit theorem for class AII$^\dagger$ and numerically demonstrate that our approach correctly computes the potential and localization length.</description>

Abstract: Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02497v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P\'erot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene increases conductance near the Dirac point but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering is a powerful technique to measure the microwave excitations present in a magnetic system. In microfocused mode, the light is focused on the sample using a microscope objective. This accelerates substantially the measurement but results in mixing the response of all microwave excitations into a single spectrum, such that modeling is required to disentangle the contribution of each spin wave. By assuming that a spectrum collected in microfocused mode can be approximated by the sum of all back-scattering spectra that can be collected by the microscope objective, we develop a simple and direct way of interpreting spectra. The model is compared to experimental data collected on a 50 nm thick CoFeB magnetic film. The model allows the understanding of the influence of the optical properties of a sample, of the dispersion relation of the spin wave eigenexcitations and of their thickness profiles, as well as of their populations onto the magnitudes and the lineshapes of the characteristic features of a spectrum</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to pristine graphene, whose fishbone-shaped spectra oscillate at twice the pump laser frequency, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits an additional component oscillating at the pump laser frequency, induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into these interesting results, we employ a simplified model to derive an analytical expression for the spectral component stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, revealing that the intensity of the fundamental-frequency spectral component depends not only on the Berry connection but also on the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the van Hove singularities. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</description>

      <title>Alternating Spintronics: Capacitive Behavior of Spin Valves and Resonator Applications</title>

Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.</description>

      <title>Swapping exchange and spin-orbit induced correlated phases in proximitized Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.</description>

      <title>Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. This is an example for a correlated hopping model where chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter and find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard patterns in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero-energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits: Association of thermoelectric converters in stationary non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following up on the recently published circuit theory for thermodynamic devices, we consider networks of Thermo-Electric Converters (TECs) in stationary non-equilibrium. Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>
