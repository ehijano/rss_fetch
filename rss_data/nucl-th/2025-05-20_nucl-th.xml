      <title>Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star crust to perturbative-QCD densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a "pQCD likelihood," and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a "unified" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</description>

      <title>Searching for entanglement in final polarization states of the neutron-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate polarization states of the outgoing neutron-proton ($np$) pair in elastic polarized neutron and proton scattering, aiming to find unambiguous evidence for entanglement of their spin states. To obtain complete information about these states, we calculate, using the high precision nucleon-nucleon potential AV18, the final polarizations of the neutron and proton as well as their spin correlation coefficients, which unequivocally define the corresponding spin density matrix. We compute all terms contributing to polarizations and spin correlations, e.g. not only induced polarizations and correlations resulting from unpolarized $np$ scattering, but also contributions from single polarization and correlation transfers from individual polarized incoming nucleons, and, for the first time, allotment to both quantities stemming from a doubly spin polarized initial state. We find that for the most part the final spin states are statistical mixture of states. The only pure states occur for highly polarized incoming neutrons and protons with maximal polarizations; however, these still contain components with each neutron and proton spin projections, and thus cannot be entangled.</description>

      <title>Classifying metal-poor stars with machine learning using nucleosynthesis calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the capabilities of machine learning (ML) to discern patterns in order to classify metal-poor stars. To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ($r$) neutron capture process can take place. Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward.</description>

      <title>Left-right splitting of elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions: TRENTo-3D initialization and CLVisc hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the TRENTo-3D initial condition model coupled with (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamic simulations, we systematically investigate the left-right splitting of elliptic flow ($\Delta v_{2}$) for soft particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our study reveals that the final distribution characteristics of $\Delta v_{2}$ are primarily depend on the odd flow harmonics and $v_{2}$ itself. We find that the parton transverse momentum scale $k_\mathrm{T}$ not only determines the geometric tilt of the QGP fireball but also significantly affects the rapidity dependence of both $v_1$ and $\Delta v_{2}$, providing new insights into the splitting mechanism of $\Delta v_{2}$. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that $\Delta v_{2} (p_\mathrm{T})$ exhibits significant sensitivity to influences such as the sub-nucleonic degrees of freedom (or `hotspots'), transverse momentum scale, and fragmentation region profile. By analyzing the $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{2}/v_{2}$ ratio, our findings provide new constraints on the uncertainties of the QGP initial state and provide additional constraints for refining model parameters.</description>

      <title>A modern Fortran library for SU(3) coupling and recoupling coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ has applications in several branches of physics. Many of these applications depend on availability of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ coupling and recoupling coefficients. We have developed a modern Fortran library for calculation of the coupling coefficients, for both the $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group chains, and the recoupling coefficients. The library implements the algorithms of Draayer, Akiyama, and Millener, which are laid out in the paper. Performance of the library has been tested and compared to the Akiyama-Draayer (AD) library implementing the same algorithms as well as to a more recent implementation. Our library works for a larger range of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ quantum numbers and provides more accurate coupling coefficients with large quantum numbers than the AD library.</description>

      <title>Proton Structure Functions from Holographic Einstein-Dilaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the proton structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the context of holography. We develop a general framework that extends previous holographic calculations of $F_1$ and $F_2$ to the case where the bulk geometry stems from bottom-up Einstein-Dilaton models, which are commonly used in the literature to describe some properties of QCD in the strong coupling regime. We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. Once the parameters of the background holographic model are fixed, we introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk {\it a la} Polchinski and Strassler to determine the corresponding structure functions. This particular realization of the model can successfully describe the proton mass and provide results for $F_2$ at large $x$ that are in qualitative agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Investigating quarkonium collectivity in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions has exhibited properties of a mostly perfect fluid. These properties can be observed through the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. Experimentally, this was established by measuring azimuthal anisotropies in the final state, known as elliptic flow ($v_2$) or higher order harmonics such as triangular flow ($v_3$). These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured in past experiments using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quarks production and thermalization in the QGP. In this study, we investigate quarkonia collectivity using Run 3 data collected in 2023, presenting new flow measurements. We employ different experimental methods to extract flow coefficients, including the scalar product, event plane, and cumulant methods. These results will impose new constraints on theoretical models, enhancing our understanding of quarkonia behavior in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of heavy vector mesons in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ mesons in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is performed, considering distinct assumptions for the modeling of the nuclear photon flux, photon - nucleus cross - section, overlap function and dipole - proton scattering amplitude. The comparison of these predictions with the ALICE data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of the production of both mesons will be very useful to improve the description of photon - induced processes in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of pQCD energy loss across system size, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present suppression predictions from our pQCD-based energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections, for high-$p_T$ $\pi$, $D$ and $B$ meson $R_{AB}$ as a function of centrality, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$ from large to small collision systems at RHIC and LHC. A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-$p_T$ suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted $\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized $R^{\pi^0}_{d \text{Au}} \simeq 0.75 $ in $0-5\%$ centrality $d$ + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured $R^{h^{\pm}}_{p \text{Pb}} \gtrsim 1$ in $0-5\%$ centrality $p$ + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in ${}^3$He + Au and $p$ + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-$p_T$ scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss.</description>

      <title>LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref.~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with {\it ad hoc} mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal and Transverse form Factors from $^{65}$Cu and $^{71}$Ga Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, the inelastic electron scattering for longitudinal and transverse form factors of $^{65}$Cu and $^{71}$Ga nuclei lie in the fp-shell region are studied in the framework of the shell model. The calculation is performed in the ($1f_{5/2}$,$2p_{3/2}$,$2p_{1/2}$,$1g_{9/2}$) model space using jun45 effective interaction. The wavefunctions employed to conduct the shell model calculations are extracted from the jun45 effective interaction for these nuclei with the jj44 shell model space and $(Sk35-Skzs^{*})$ residual interaction to evaluate the interactions matrix element between initial and final states. The effective charges used to account for the core-polarization (CP) effect are created using calculations of microscopic perturbations that include intermediate one-particle, one-hole excitation from the core and the model space (MS) orbits into all upper orbits with n$\hbar\omega$ excitations following the same approach done in [Ref.20]. To account for the (CP) effects contribution, the inelastic form factor is obtained by employing the shape of Tassie and Bohr-Mottelson models with appropriate proton and neutron effective charges. The calculated form factors were compared with available experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We discuss new spin observables presently accessible to measurement in the proton-deuteron (pd) system, namely polarization transfer coefficients from doubly spin-polarized initial state to the outgoing nucleon in the elastic nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering and in the nucleon-induced deuteron breakup reactions. The sensitivity of these observables to three-nucleon force (3NF) effects is investigated and compared to sensitivities of the constituent standard single polarization transfer coefficients in the neutron-deuteron (nd) system. $K_{y,y}^{y'}$ in elastic nd scattering, for which large 3NF effects, up to 40\%, have been found at higher energies, seems the most promising observable to measure.</description>

      <title>Collective excited states at small amplitude in neutron elastic scattering at low-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the contributions of isoscalar and isovector collective excitations in the neutron elastic scattering of $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb nuclei by using a microscopic optical potential (MOP) derived from nuclear structure models based on self-consistent mean-field approaches. Particular attention is given to the role of these collective modes in shaping the imaginary part of the MOP and the resulting angular distributions. Our analysis indicates that both isoscalar and isovector contributions are significant for all considered targets, especially for light and medium targets. Furthermore, the Coulomb interaction is found to play an important role in describing absorption mechanisms and reproducing the experimental angular distributions.</description>

      <title>Review of Neutron Yield from (${\alpha}$, n) Reactions: Data, Methods, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is crucial in many areas of physics, including dark matter searches, neutrino studies, and nuclear astrophysics. In addition to its relevance for fundamental research, the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction also plays a significant role in nuclear energy technologies, for example by contributing to neutron production in subcritical systems using UO$_{2}$, as well as in applications such as medical physics. This review examines the current state of (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations and neutron spectra, describes the computational tools used for their estimation, and discusses the available cross-section data. We explore the uncertainties affecting (${\alpha}$, n) yield estimations and propose a strategy to enhance their accuracy. Furthermore, this paper discusses and emphasizes the need for new measurements of (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of relevant materials. Such measurements are essential for improving neutron flux predictions, which are crucial for reducing uncertainties in sensitivity estimates for next-generation physics experiments operating in the keV--MeV range.</description>

      <title>Confronting the low-scale seesaw and leptogenesis with neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the impact of heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV-GeV range on neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in view of updated results for the lifetime of this process. Working in a minimal realistic extension of the Standard Model by two right-handed neutrino flavours, we show that the non-observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ will impose strong bounds on the heavy neutrino properties that are complementary to the limits obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and collider searches. For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\nu\beta\beta$ from next-generation experiments, assuming an improvement of two orders of magnitude on the current $0\nu\beta\beta$ limits will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators, and restricts the mass splitting to values that can be resolved at experiments. For a normal mass hierarchy, restricting the allowed parameter will require even stronger $0\nu\beta\beta$ limits, and only parts of the parameter space can then be probed.</description>

      <title>Improved evaluation of the electroweak contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A precise evaluation of the electroweak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon requires control over all aspects of the Standard Model, ranging from Higgs physics, over multi-loop computations for bosonic and (heavy-)fermion diagrams, to non-perturbative effects in the presence of light quarks. Currently, the dominant uncertainties arise from such hadronic effects in the vector-vector-axial-vector three-point function, an improved understanding of which has recently emerged in the context of hadronic light-by-light scattering. Profiting from these developments as well as new perturbative and non-perturbative input for the charm contribution, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{EW}=154.4(4)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moments of electron and $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Refs. [1,2] we provided a complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While the evaluation strategy was developed for the kinematic situation determined by the muon mass, a similar approach also applies to the HLbL corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and $\tau$ lepton, shifting the sensitivity in the loop integrals to smaller and larger momenta, respectively. In this Letter, we propagate the corresponding uncertainties of the various contributions, obtaining $a_e^\text{HLbL}= 3.51(23)\times 10^{-14}$ and $a_\tau^\text{HLbL}= 3.77(29)\times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Local equilibrium Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal connections between the spin density matrix and the Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles forming a relativistic gas are explored to determine their general structures. They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. The applicability of the new form is determined and found to comprise the range of hydrodynamic parameters used in current models of heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, the new definition of the Wigner function leads to the generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were obtained earlier in the approach using the classical concept of spin.</description>
