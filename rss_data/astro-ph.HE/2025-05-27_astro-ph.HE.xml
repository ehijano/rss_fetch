      <title>A Cosmic Ray Acceleration Mechanism Based on Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities Yielding Power-Law Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, momentum transport generated by the combined effects of pitch-angle diffusion and Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities (BFVIs) is proposed to obtain a cosmic rays acceleration mechanism, starting from the well-known focusing equation describing particle diffusion and acceleration. The inhomogeneities of background flow velocity is ubiquitous in astrophysical environment. The isotropic distribution function equation of charged energetic particles is derived, and its solution is obtained, demonstrating the form of momentum power laws of cosmic rays. In addition, if it is assumed that cosmic rays penetrate compressible plasma waves or turbulence, for quasi-steady states, the spectral index $\delta$ of the momentum power law spectrum of cosmic rays is found to be in the range $[-5, -3]$, which includes the observed power law indices of galactic cosmic rays. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the mechanism proposed in this article, along with shock acceleration, may also contribute to the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Furthermore, when momentum convection effect and higher-order momentum derivative terms are considered, the indices of power laws should be smaller than $-5$. This may explain the power laws of solar energetic particle events.</description>

      <title>Across the Universe: Dark Matter and Galaxy Cross-Correlations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be a ground-based Cherenkov telescope performing wide-sky surveys, ideal for anisotropy studies such as cross-correlations with tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure. Cross-correlations can shed light on high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and potentially reveal exotic signals from particle dark matter. In this work, we investigate CTAO sensitivity to cross-correlation signals between $\gamma$-ray emission and galaxy distributions. We find that by using dense, low-redshift catalogs like 2MASS, and for integration times around 50 hours, this technique achieves sensitivities to both annihilating and decaying dark matter signals that are competitive with those from dwarf galaxy and cluster analyses.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Observations of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 3667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the hard X-ray emission from the central region of Abell 3667 using deep NuSTAR observations. While previous studies on the nature of the hard X-ray excess have been controversial, our analysis of the central region suggests that the excess is primarily thermal, best described by a two-temperature (2T) model, with the high-temperature component likely arising from merger-induced heating. This interpretation contrasts with some earlier suggestions of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Additionally, we set a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of $\sim 0.2 \, \mu$G in the central region, consistent with values found in other dynamically active clusters and compatible with those inferred from equipartition and Faraday rotation measurements. Since our study is focused on the central region of the cluster, further high-resolution observations of the outer regions will be critical to fully disentangle the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the X-ray.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Universe Observatory on a Super-Pressure Balloon II: Mission, Payload, and Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is a pathfinder mission toward a space-based observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The aim of POEMMA is the observation of Ultra High Energy COsmic Rays (UHECRs) in order to elucidate their nature and origins and to discover $\gtrsim$ 20 PeV very high energy neutrinos that originate from transient and steady astrophysical sources. EUSO-SPB2 was launched from W\=anaka New Zealand on May 13th, 2023 as a NASA Balloon Program Office test flight. The mission goals included making the first near-space altitude observations of the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) and making the first direct Cherenkov light emission from PeV cosmic rays traversing Earth's atmosphere. In addition, a Target of Opportunity program was developed for selecting and scheduling observations of potential neutrino sources as they passed just below the Earth's limb. Although a leaky balloon forced termination over the Pacific Ocean after 37 hours, data was collected to demonstrate the successful commissioning and operation of the instruments. This paper includes a description of the payload and the key instruments, pre-flight instrument characterizations in the lab and in the desert, flight operations and examples of the data collected. The flight was too short to catch a UHECR event via fluorescence, however about 10 candidate EAS events from cosmic rays were recorded via Cherenkov light.</description>

      <title>Is the Fermi source 4FGL J1824.2+1231 a transitional millisecond pulsar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) in tight binary systems represent an important evolutionary link between low-mass X-ray binaries and radio millisecond pulsars. To date, only three confirmed tMSPs and a few candidates have been discovered. Most of them are gamma-ray sources. For this reason, searching for multiwavelength counterparts to unassociated Fermi gamma-ray sources can help to find new tMSPs. Here we investigate whether the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGL J1824.2+1231 belongs to the tMSP family. To find the counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231, we used data from SRG/eROSITA and Swift X-ray catalogues, and from different optical catalogues. We also performed time-series photometric optical observations of the source with the 2.1-m telescope of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, the 1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak Astronomical Observatory and the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope. In addition, we carried out optical spectroscopic observations with the Russian-Turkish telescope and used archival spectroscopic data obtained with the Gemini-North telescope. Within the position error ellipse of 4FGL J1824.2+1231, we found only one X-ray source which coincides with an optical object. We consider it as a likely multiwavelength counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231. The source shows strong optical variability and significant proper motion. The latter strongly implies that this is a Galactic source. Double-peaked H and He emission lines are detected in its spectrum with a flat continuum, as often observed in accretion disks of compact binary systems. The X-ray spectrum is well fitted by a power law with the photon index 1.7. The derived intrinsic X-ray-to-gamma-ray flux ratio is about 0.2. If the X-ray/optical source is the true counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231, then all its properties suggest that it is a tMSP in the subluminous disk state.</description>

      <title>Kilonova modelling and parameter inference: Understanding uncertainties and evaluating compatibility between observations and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of optical transients, parameter inference is the process of extracting physical information, i.e. constraints on the source's characteristics, by comparing the observed lightcurves to the predictions of different models and finding the model and parameter combination that make the closest match. In the developing field of the study of kilonovae (KNe), systematic uncertainties in modelling are still very large, and many models struggle to fit satisfactorily the whole multi-wavelength dataset of the AT2017gfo kilonova, associated to the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger GW170817. In a multi-messenger context, we sometime observe tensions between KN-only inference results and constraints from other messengers. In order to discuss the compatibility of KN models with observations and with the information derived from other messengers, we detail the process of Bayesian parameter inference, identifying the many sources of uncertainty embedded in KN analyses. We highlight the systematic error margin hyperparameter $\sigma_{\rm sys}$, which can be exploited as a metric for a model's goodness-of-fit. We then discuss how to assess the performance of parameter inference analyses by quantifying the information gain using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between prior and posterior. Using the example of the Bu2019lm model with the NMMA Bayesian inference framework, we showcase the expected performance that dedicated KN follow-ups with telescope networks could reasonably reach, highlighting the different factors (observational cadence, error margins) that influence such inference performances. We finally apply our KN analysis to the dataset of AT2017gfo to validate our performance predictions and discuss the complementarity of multi-messenger approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands, and focusing on the $n=1$ photon ring, we investigate which values of the non-minimal coupling can be robustly excluded.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL/ISGRI post 2024-periastron view of PSR B1259-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a well-studied gamma-ray binary hosting a pulsar in a 3.4-year eccentric orbit around a Be-type star. Its non-thermal emission spans from radio to TeV energies, exhibiting a significant increase near the periastron passage. This paper is dedicated to the analysis of INTEGRAL observations of the system following its last periastron passage in June 2024. We aim to study the spectral evolution of this gamma-ray binary in the soft (0.3-10 keV) and hard (30-300 keV) X-ray energy bands. We performed a joint analysis of the data taken by INTEGRAL/ISGRI in July-August 2024 and quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT observations. The spectrum of the system in the 0.3-300 keV band is well described by an absorbed power law with a photon index of $\Gamma=1.42\pm 0.03$. We place constraints on potential spectral curvature, limiting the break energy $E_\mathrm{b}&gt;30$ keV for $\Delta\Gamma&gt;0.3$ and cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{cutoff}&gt;150$ keV at 95% confidence level. For one-zone leptonic emission models, these values correspond to electron distribution spectral parameters of $E_\mathrm{b,e}&gt;0.8$ TeV and $E_\mathrm{cutoff,e}&gt;1.7$ TeV, consistent with previous constraints derived by H.E.S.S.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole scalarization with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can evade no-hair theorems and allow for non-trivial scalar profiles around black holes. This coupling is characterized by a length scale $\lambda$, which, in an effective field theory perspective, sets the threshold below which deviations from General Relativity become significant. LIGO/VIRGO constraints indicate $\lambda$ is small, implying supermassive black holes should not scalarize. However, recent work suggests that scalarization can occur within a narrow window of masses, allowing supermassive black holes to scalarize, while leaving LIGO/VIRGO sources unaffected. We explore the impact of this scenario on the stochastic gravitational wave background recently observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We find that scalarization can alter the characteristic strain produced by circularly inspiralling SMBH binaries and that current data shows a marginal preference for a non-zero $\lambda$. However, similar signatures could arise from astrophysical effects such as orbital eccentricity or environmental interactions, emphasizing the need for improved modeling and longer observations to discriminate among the different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion Dark Matter Near Relaxing Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter passing through the magnetospheres of magnetars can undergo hyper-efficient resonant mixing with low-energy photons, leading to the production of narrow spectral lines that could be detectable on Earth. Since this is a resonant process triggered by the spatial variation in the photon dispersion relation, the luminosity and spectral properties of the emission are highly sensitive to the charge and current densities permeating the magnetosphere. To date, a majority of the studies investigating this phenomenon have assumed a perfectly dipolar magnetic field structure with a near-field plasma distribution fixed to the minimal charge-separated force-free configuration. While this {may} be a reasonable treatment for the closed field lines of conventional radio pulsars, the strong magnetic fields around magnetars are believed to host processes that drive strong deviations from this minimal configuration. In this work, we study how realistic magnetar magnetospheres impact the electromagnetic emission produced from axion dark matter. Specifically, we construct charge and current distributions that are consistent with magnetar observations, and use these to recompute the prospective sensitivity of radio and sub-mm telescopes to axion dark matter. We demonstrate that the two leading models yield vastly different predictions for the frequency and amplitude of the spectral line, indicating systematic uncertainties in the plasma structure are significant. Finally, we discuss various observational signatures that can be used to differentiate the local plasma loading mechanism of an individual magnetar, which will be necessary if there is hope of using such objects to search for axions.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Dynamical Friction on Hyperbolic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of equal-mass hyperbolic encounters, embedded in a uniform gaseous medium. Using linear perturbation theory, we calculate the density wakes excited by these perturbers and compute the resulting forces exerted on them by the gas. We compute the changes to orbital energy, orbital angular momentum and apsidal precession across a wide range of eccentrities and pericenter Mach numbers. We identify six distinct classes of hyperbolic orbits, differing through their wake structure and subsequent orbital evolution. We find the gas to always dissipate orbital energy, leading to smaller semi-major axes and higher pericenter Mach numbers. The orbital angular momentum can either increase or decrease, whereas we typically find the orbital eccentricity to be damped, promoting supersonic gas-captures. Additionally, we find that the force exerted by the gas is not strictly frictional -- particularly for asymptotically subsonic trajectories. Therefore, despite the orbit-integrated changes to orbital parameters being similar to those predicted by the \cite{O99} prescription, the time evolution of the density wakes and the instantaneous forces exerted on the perturbers are significantly different.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structural Properties of Anisotropic Dark Matter-Admixed Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic compact stars comprising two non-interacting fluids: quark matter and condensed dark matter. Using the MIT Bag model equation of state for quark matter and Bose-Einstein Condensate equation of state for dark matter, we numerically compute interior solutions for those two-fluid component spherical configurations. Varying the initial central density ratio of dark matter to quark matter, we examine how different proportions of these components influence the mass-radius profile, the factor of compactness as well as the quark mass fraction. Recent studies suggest that quark matter may exist in the cores of massive neutron stars, significantly affecting their structure and stability. We calculate the factor of compactness for both negative and positive anisotropy cases explored in this article. Our findings demonstrate that dark matter-admixed quark stars are more compact yet less massive compared to pure quark matter stars, aligning with recent theoretical predictions and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Characteristic precessions of spherical orbit around a rotating braneworld black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the orbital dynamics and relativistic precession effects in the spacetime of rotating braneworld black holes within the Randall-Sundrum framework. For test particles on spherical orbits, we analyze three conserved quantities-energy, angular momentum, and Carter constant-and examine how the innermost stable spherical orbit depends on the tidal charge and orbital inclination. Compared to Kerr black holes, braneworld corrections significantly modify both nodal and periastron precession frequencies: positive tidal charges suppress precession rates, while negative charges enhance them. For stationary gyroscopes, we calculate the Lense-Thirring precession frequency and demonstrate its sensitivity to the tidal charge, black hole spin, and gyroscope orientation. Our results show that a positive tidal charge weakens frame-dragging effects even as it enhances gravitational attraction-offering a distinctive signature of extra-dimensional gravity. These results have important implications for astrophysical observations, including accretion disk behavior, stellar orbital dynamics, and gravitational wave detection. The modified orbital and gyroscopic precession provide new ways to test braneworld gravity in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Fully general relativistic description of rapidly-rotating axially-symmetric neutron stars for constraining nuclear matter equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Constraining the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) from neutron star observations is one of the main subjects in nuclear physics today. In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $&gt;$400Hz.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the 5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function for the reduced confluent Heun problem. Furthermore, up to $O(G^2)$ we compute the dynamical $\ell=0$, and the static $\ell=1$, scalar tidal Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description for a scalar wave scattering off the black hole, to our novel ultraviolet-NS solutions. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of internal shocks in spherical geometry: hydrodynamics and prompt emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the models used to explain the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), internal shocks is a leading one. Its most basic ingredient is a collision between two cold shells of different Lorentz factors in an ultra-relativistic outflow, which forms a pair of shock fronts that accelerate electrons in their wake. In this model, key features of GRB prompt emission such as the doubly-broken power-law spectral shape arise naturally from the optically-thin synchrotron emission at both shock fronts. We investigate the internal shocks model as a mechanism for prompt emission based on a full hydrodynamical analytic derivation in planar geometry, extending this approach to spherical geometry using hydrodynamic simulations. We used the moving mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code \texttt{GAMMA} to study the collision of two ultra-relativistic cold shells of equal kinetic energy (and power). Using the built-in shock detection, we calculate the corresponding synchrotron emission by the relativistic electrons accelerated into a power-law energy distribution behind the shock, in the fast cooling regime.}During the first dynamical time after the collision, the spherical effects cause the shock strength to decrease with radius. The observed peak frequency decreases faster than expected by other models in the rising part of the pulse, and the peak flux saturates even for moderately short pulses. This is likely caused by the very sharp edges of the shells in our model, while smoother edges will probably mitigate this effect. Our model traces the evolution of the peak frequency back to the source activity time scales.</description>

      <title>The role of equation of state on the spin-up of millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are recycled pulsars which have been spun-up due to mass accretion during the phase of mass exchange in binaries. Although the interactions with companion stars play important roles on the spin-up process, the global properties of pulsars determined by the equation of state (EoS), such as mass, radius and the moment of inertia, should also play a role. We investigate the spin-up of MSPs in neutron star (NS) and strangeon star (SS) models, both of which have passed the tests by the existence of high-mass pulsars and the tidal deformability of GW170817. Combining the spin-up condition and the transferred angular momentum, we can constrain the accreted mass and the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength will be important in impeding the spin-up of NSs, especially to the ones with low masses, but the impeding effect would not be important to SSs. The results indicate that it is easier for an SS to form a fully recycled low-mass MPS, whose spin-period is below 10 ms and mass is below about $1.5 M_\odot$, than that for an NS. Finding more low-mass and fully recycled MSPs, with accurate mass-measurement and better constraints on magnetic field strength, could help to put more strict constraints on the EoS of pulsars.</description>

Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In axion models, interactions between axions and electromagnetic waves induce frequency-dependent time delays determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods. We compute such delays under realistic radio telescope conditions and identify a prominent dispersive feature near half the axion mass, which appears non-divergent within the limits of observational resolution. Based on this, we develop a machine learning pipeline that achieves 95\% classification accuracy and demonstrates robust detection performance in low signal-to-noise regimes. When applied to PSR J1933-6211, no axion-induced delay is detected within current sensitivity limits. Future improvements in optical clock precision and telescope bandwidth, particularly with instruments such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, may enhance constraints on the axion decay constant by up to four orders of magnitude in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>The Role of High-mass Stellar Binaries in the Formation of High-mass Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (&gt;=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. We study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers and their implications for the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra detections as a function of fb_15_prime.</description>

      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are essential for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. A proton flux measurement method, based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and deep learning techniques, is presented. After the necessary pre-processing of ground-based NM data using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we simulate the relationship between NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). The daily proton flux data, ranging from 1 GV to 100 GV, are obtained for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing strong agreement with the observed values. In addition, daily proton flux measurements are provided for periods when AMS data were unavailable due to operational reasons. For the first time, hourly proton fluxes as a function of rigidity are calculated dedicated to the short-time solar activity studies.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the Search for New Physics in Pulsar Timing Data and the Case of Kination-amplified Gravitational-wave Background from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <title>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</title>

Abstract: Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</description>

      <title>Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>
