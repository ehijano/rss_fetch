      <title>The embodied brain: Bridging the brain, body, and behavior with neuromechanical digital twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal behavior reflects interactions between the nervous system, body, and environment. Therefore, biomechanics and environmental context must be considered to dissect algorithms for behavioral control. This is enabled by leveraging neuromechanical digital twins: computational models that embed artificial neural controllers within realistic body models in simulated environments. Here we review advances in the creation and use of neuromechanical digital twins while also highlighting emerging opportunities for the future. First, we illustrate how neuromechanical models allow researchers to infer hidden biophysical variables that may be difficult to measure experimentally. Additionally, by perturbing these models, one can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses. Next, we explore how neuromechanical twins have been used to foster a deeper exchange between neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Finally, we show how neuromechanical twins can advance healthcare. We envision that coupling studies on animals with active probing of their neuromechanical twins will greatly accelerate neuroscientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Training Under Attentional Competition Produces Persistent Biases in Visual Appearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective attention can momentarily alter visual appearance, but can such effects be learned? We tested whether training attention under sensory competition produces lasting changes in perceived contrast. Across seven days, participants trained on an orientation task with a fixed target location, with or without a salient distractor. Before and after training, we measured the point of subjective equality (PSE). Training under competition produced a reliable push-pull shift. Stimuli at the trained location appeared higher in contrast, whereas stimuli at the untrained location appeared lower. Conversely, training without distractors improved performance but did not alter appearance. Crucially, these opponent shifts were robust to task variations, persisting even in equality judgments designed to minimize response bias. Furthermore, the effect generalized to stimuli with novel orientation and contrast levels. These findings demonstrate that resolving sensory competition does not merely improve discrimination, but durably recalibrates the subjective appearance of the visual world.</description>

      <title>Gyral-Sulcal-Net: An Integrated Network Representation of Brain Folding Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)</description>

      <title>A whole-brain model of amyloid beta accumulation and cerebral hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the "two-hit vascular hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.</description>

      <title>Stable Filtering for Efficient Dimensionality Reduction of Streaming Manifold Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.</description>

      <title>Modulating task outcome value to mitigate real-world procrastination via noninvasive brain stimulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a 6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway to account the conceptualized roles of self-control on procrastination, and potentially offers a validated, theory-driven strategy for interventions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

      <title>WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals into physiological activity, pathological (epileptic) activity, power-line noise, and other non-cerebral artifacts. Traditional methods for iEEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of iEEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,231 samples using a 70/20/10 split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous non-specialized CNN- and LSTM-based approaches and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model achieves high discrimination of noise and artifact classes, with precisions of 0.98 and approximately 1, respectively. Classification between physiological and pathological signals exhibits a modest but clinically interpretable overlap, with F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.90 and 175 and 272 cross-class false positives, respectively, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well-suited for iEEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling the capture of both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The study also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning, the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, and normalization steps that support high model performance. While the results demonstrate strong in-distribution performance, generalizability across datasets and clinical settings has yet to be established.</description>
