      <title>Temporal-Aligned Meta-Learning for Risk Management: A Stacking Approach for Multi-Source Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models.
  The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Micro-Level Claims Reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outstanding claim liabilities are revised repeatedly as claims develop, yet most modern reserving models are trained as one-shot predictors and typically learn only from settled claims. We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.</description>

      <title>A Three--Dimensional Efficient Surface for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical mean-variance framework characterizes portfolio risk solely through return variance and the covariance matrix, implicitly assuming that all relevant sources of risk are captured by second moments. In modern financial markets, however, shocks often propagate through complex networks of interconnections, giving rise to systemic and spillover risks that variance alone does not reflect.
  This paper develops a unified portfolio optimization framework that incorporates connectedness risk alongside expected return and variance. Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of optimal portfolios under mild regularity conditions and derive closed-form solutions when short-selling is allowed. The trade-off between variance and connectedness is shown to be strictly monotone except in degenerate cases, yielding a well-defined risk-risk frontier.
  Under simultaneous diagonalizability of the covariance and connectedness matrices, we prove a three-fund separation theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as affine combinations of a minimum-variance portfolio, a minimum-connectedness portfolio, and the tangency portfolio. The framework clarifies how network-based risk alters classical diversification results and provides a transparent theoretical foundation for incorporating systemic connectedness into portfolio choice.</description>

      <title>Tab-TRM: Tiny Recursive Model for Insurance Pricing on Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tab-TRM (Tabular-Tiny Recursive Model), a network architecture that adapts the recursive latent reasoning paradigm of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) to insurance modeling. Drawing inspiration from both the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and its simplified successor TRM, the Tab-TRM model makes predictions by reasoning over the input features. It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes. Conceptually, Tab-TRM bridges classical actuarial workflows - iterative generalized linear model fitting and minimum-bias calibration - on the one hand, and modern machine learning, in terms of Gradient Boosting Machines, on the other.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk measures with markets volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.06185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As systemic risk has become a hot topic in the financial markets, how to measure, allocate and regulate the systemic risk are becoming especially important. However, the financial markets are becoming more and more complicate, which makes the usual study of systemic risk to be restricted. In this paper, we will study the systemic risk measures on a special space $L^{p(\cdot)}$ where the variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ is no longer a given real number like the space $L^{p}$, but a random variable, which reflects the possible volatility of the financial markets. Finally, the dual representation for this new systemic risk measures will be studied. Our results show that every this new systemic risk measure can be decomposed into a convex certain function and a simple-systemic risk measure, which provides a new ideas for dealing with the systemic risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a nested stochastic approximation algorithm and its multilevel acceleration to compute the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of a random financial loss. We hereby establish central limit theorems for the renormalized estimation errors associated with both algorithms as well as their averaged versions. Our findings are substantiated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Model Combination in Risk Sharing under Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of an agent who faces losses in continuous time over a finite time horizon and may choose to share some of these losses with a counterparty. The agent is uncertain about the true loss distribution and has multiple models for the losses. Their goal is to optimize a mean-variance type criterion with model combination under ambiguity through risk sharing. We construct such a criterion using the chi-squared divergence, adapting the monotone mean-variance preferences of Maccheroni et al. (2009) to the model combination setting and exploit a dual representation to expand the state space, yielding a time consistent problem. Assuming a Cram\'er-Lundberg loss model, we fully characterize the optimal risk sharing contract and the agent's wealth process under the optimal strategy. Furthermore, we prove that the strategy we obtain is admissible and that the value function satisfies the appropriate verification conditions. Finally, we apply the optimal strategy to an insurance setting using data from a Spanish automobile insurance portfolio, where we obtain differing models using cross-validation and provide numerical illustrations of the results.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes Model, comparison between Analytical Solution and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to give a general overview and understanding of the first widely used option-pricing model, the Black-Scholes model. The history and context are presented, with the usefulness and implications in the economics world. A brief review of fundamental calculus concepts is introduced to derive and solve the model. The equation is then resolved using both an analytical (variable separation) and a numerical method (finite differences). Conclusions are drawn in order to understand how Black-Scholes is employed nowadays. At the end a handy appendix (A) is written with some economics notions to ease the reader's comprehension of the paper; furthermore a second appendix (B) is given with some code scripts, to allow the reader to put in practice some concepts.</description>
