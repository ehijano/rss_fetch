      <title>Advanced Analysis of Hawking Temperature Calculation for Novel Topological Black Holes using Laurent Series and the RVB Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs Laurent series expansions and the Robson--Villari--Biancalana (RVB) method to provide a refined derivation of the Hawking temperature for two newly introduced topological black hole solutions. Previous calculations have demonstrated inconsistencies when applying traditional methods to such exotic horizons, prompting the need for a more thorough mathematical analysis. By systematically incorporating higher-order terms in the Laurent expansions of the metric functions near the horizon and leveraging the topological features characterized by the Euler characteristic, we reveal additional corrections to the Hawking temperature beyond standard approaches. These findings underscore the subtle interplay between local geometry, spacetime topology, and quantum effects. The results clarify discrepancies found in earlier works, present a more accurate representation of thermodynamic properties for the black holes in question, and suggest broader implications for topological structures in advanced gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Non zero Coriolis field in Ehlers' Frame Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ehlers' Frame Theory is a class of geometric theories parameterized by $\lambda := 1/c^2$ and identical to the General Theory of Relativity for $\lambda \neq 0$. The limit $\lambda \to 0$ does not recover Newtonian gravity, as one might expect, but yields the so-called Newton-Cartan theory of gravity, which is characterized by a second gravitational field $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, called the Coriolis field. Such a field encodes at a non-relativistic level the dragging feature of general spacetimes, as we show explicitly for the case of the $(\eta,H)$ geometries. Taking advantage of the Coriolis field, we apply Ehlers' theory to an axially symmetric distribution of matter, mimicking, for example, a disc galaxy, and show how its dynamics might reproduce a flattish rotation curve. In the same setting, we further exploit the formal simplicity of Ehlers' formalism in addressing non-stationary cases, which are remarkably difficult to be treated in the General Theory of Relativity. We show that the time derivative of the Coriolis field gives rise to a tangential acceleration which allows to study a possible formation in time of the rotation curve's flattish feature.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills Regular Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate regular black hole solutions in nonminimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory modified by Rainbow Gravity, focusing on the impact of quantum gravity effects on their thermodynamics, particle emission, energy conditions, curvature, and shadow formation. We find that the rainbow parameter $\lambda$ alters Hawking's temperature, entropy, and specific heat, leading to modified phase transitions and the possible formation of remnants. We calculate the graybody factor demonstrating that particle emission is enhanced with increasing $\lambda$, reflecting the behavior of the temperature and confirming the impact of the rainbow parameter on the evaporation process. Energy conditions are violated inside the black hole, with violations intensifying for larger $\lambda$. We also show that Rainbow Gravity mitigates singularity formation by softening the curvature near the origin, contributing to the regularity of the solution. Finally, we study the black hole shadow and demonstrate that its radius decreases as quantum gravity effects strengthen, suggesting potential observational tests for Rainbow Gravity. These results highlight the role of Rainbow Gravity in modifying black hole physics and provides a framework for exploring quantum gravitational corrections in astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Expansion of the Universe in Nonmetricity-based Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the cosmological implications of modified gravity, focusing on nonmetricity-based $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model in explaining cosmic acceleration. Chapter I lays the theoretical groundwork by reviewing General Relativity (GR), $\Lambda$CDM, and the limitations of the standard model, motivating $f(Q)$ gravity. Chapter II constructs cosmological reconstructions of $f(Q)$ gravity within the FLRW framework, deriving forms of $f(Q)$ that replicate the $\Lambda$CDM expansion and using the e-folding parameter to show compatibility with various cosmic histories. Chapter III addresses challenges with arbitrary $f(Q)$ forms by applying Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction using observational Hubble data. This model-independent method reconstructs the Hubble parameter H(z), leading to a data-driven $f(Q)$ form. Motivated by this, a new parametrization $f(Q) = -2\Lambda + \epsilon Q^2$ is proposed, and power-law and exponential models are tested for consistency. Chapter IV incorporates a quintessence scalar field in power-law $f(Q)$ gravity to study inflation and late-time acceleration. Using GP, the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ is reconstructed and analyzed. Results show that early dark energy has little impact today, but reconstructed quintessence models offer insights into cosmic acceleration. Chapter V examines interacting dark energy and matter under power-law $f(Q)$ using dynamical systems. Two interaction types are studied, and fixed points linked to de Sitter and quintessence solutions are identified. Chapter VI concludes and suggests future work.</description>

      <title>Conformal metric perturbations and boundary term as physical source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Relativistic Quantum Geometry formalism, where the cosmological constant is promoted to a dynamical variable by attributing it a geometric interpretation as a result of a flux on the boundary of a manifold and establishing a connection between the perturbations of the Ricci tensor and the metric tensor, we propose an approach for the perturbations of the metric tensor. From this, imposing that Einstein's equations must hold for the tensors defined from the perturbed quantities obtained from conformal transformations, we derive a functional form for the cosmological parameter $\Lambda$ in terms of the cosmological parameter $\bar{\Lambda}$ of the perturbed manifold. We then use the obtained equations to propose a cosmological model based on the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric with no spatial curvature, fitting the free parameters using observational data from Hubble and Type Ia Supernovae. The model is statistically comparable to $\Lambda$CDM; although, the joint analysis produces a smaller $H_{0}^{\rm Conformal}=69.80\rm\,\, Km \,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ in contrast to the flat $\Lambda$CDM result $H_{0}^{\Lambda\rm CDM}=70.52\rm\,\, Km \,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. An evident singularity occurs when the conformal factor $\Xi^{2}=2$, yields an early universe dominated only by matter $\rho_{m}$, which undoubtedly does not correspond to a viable history of our cosmos. Despite these limitations, a specific scenario remains feasible. This study aims to offer insights into the acceleration of the universe and addresses key questions in contemporary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Effective-Field Theories of Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for building a gravitational analog model for a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate. The analogue metric is obtained using effective field theory methods, integrating out the heavy radial fluctuations. In this way, we also obtain interaction terms up to the quartic order in the fields. The microscopic Lagrangian describes a complex massive scalar field, with a global U(1) symmetry, that is spontaneously broken. From the quadratic effective Lagrangian, we obtain a dispersion law for phonons in presence of an acoustic horizon generated by the background flow. We observe that the phonon dispersion relation may exhibit a non-monotonic behavior determined by the Lagrangian's parameters. In this case, a non-trivial minimum appears associated with a characteristic length scale, indicating the breaking of translation symmetry. Then, we determine the constraints on the Lagrangian's parameters to make this happen. Finally, we design an original procedure to calculate the correlation functions through field theory tools. We apply this method to the density-density correlation function, reproducing known results. Moreover, we study the case of a non-monotonic phonon dispersion law, finding the existence of long range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates traversable wormhole spacetimes in modified theories of gravity, where the matter at the wormhole throat is described by an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. Wormhole solutions are constructed in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity under various equations of state, and their physical viability and stability are thoroughly examined. The influence of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on Casimir wormholes is also analyzed, emphasizing the role of the GUP parameter in shaping wormhole geometry in $f(Q)$ gravity. Additionally, the study investigates the observational aspects of wormholes, such as their shadow profiles and deflection angles in the presence of dark matter. The work is further extended to four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity, where the effects of dark matter models and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter on the energy conditions are evaluated. Various physical properties of the wormholes, including the complexity factor, active gravitational mass, and total gravitational energy, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gluing charged black holes into de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Hintz's cosmological black hole gluing result to the Einstein-Maxwell system with positive cosmological constant by gluing multiple Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter black holes into neighbourhoods of points in the conformal boundary of de Sitter space. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on the black hole parameters -- related to Friedrich's conformal constraint equations -- for this gluing to be possible. We also improve the original gluing method slightly by showing that the construction of a solution in Taylor series may be accomplished using an exactness argument, eliminating the need for an early gauge-fixing.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on the minimum orbital period of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has focused on establishing lower bounds on the minimum orbital period of black holes. In this work, we explore the complementary question of whether an upper bound exists for the minimum orbital period of black holes. We investigate the minimum orbital periods of three types of black holes: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the minimum orbital period of these black holes is bounded by an upper limit $T_{min} \leqslant 6\sqrt{3}\pi M$, where $M$ is the black hole mass. Our results suggest that this upper bound on the minimum orbital period may be a general property in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the physical properties of wormhole geometry within the context of $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, which serves as a teleparallel formulation of general relativity. We study a linear model, $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T+\beta\mathcal{T}$, to explore traversable wormholes. A linear equation of state is utilized for radial pressure, leading to a power-law shaped function. It was found that the violation of energy conditions, depends on the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters. A diverse array of intriguing wormhole solutions was identified, contingent upon the specific model parameters employed. It is demonstrated that isotropic wormhole solutions cannot be attained within this framework. Additionally, solutions characterized by a variable equation of state parameter are introduced. A comparative analysis of wormhole solutions in the context of $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ and curvature-based gravity, specifically $f(R,T)$, is also provided.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of spherically symmetric black hole with cosmological constant and global monopole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the scalar, electromagnetic field and Dirac field perturbations of spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of Einstein-bumblebee gravity model with global monopole and cosmological constant. We investigate the effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes (QNMs) by applying the Klein-Gordon equation, electromagnetic field equation and Dirac equation expressed in Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. Using the general method of rigorous bound, the greybody factors of scalar, electromagnetic and Dirac field are derived. Applying the sixth order WKB approximation and Pad\'{e} approximation, the QNM frequencies are derived. We also discuss the impact of global monopole $\eta$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and Lorentz violation parameter $L$ to the effective potential, greybody factor and QNMs. Increasing the parameter $\eta$ prevents the rise of effective potential for both Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS)-like and Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter (SAdS)-like black holes with global monopole and consequently increases the greybody factors. However, decreasing the parameter $L$ reduces the rise of effective potential for the SAdS-like black hole with global monopole and it increases the greybody factor but increasing the parameter $L$ has an opposite effect for SdS-like black hole with global monopole. It is also shown that the shadow radius increases with increasing the parameter $\eta$ for both dS and AdS cases. Increasing the value of $L$ tends to increase the shadow radius for dS black hole but it has an opposite effect in AdS case. A careful studying is being carried out to investigate how the absorption cross-section gets affected when the parameter $L$ appears into the picture.</description>

      <title>Shadows for Kerr-Sen-Taub-NUT black holes with Manko-Ruiz parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Kerr-Sen-Taub-NUT spacetime with the inclusion of the Manko-Ruiz parameter. We demonstrate the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a classical test particle in this spacetime and, using the null Hamilton-Jacobi equation, derive a set of equations that define the black hole shadow boundary. Our analysis reveals that the shadow shape is influenced by variations in the spacetime parameters, including the Hassan-Sen transformation parameter, which corresponds to the black hole electric charge, as well as the NUT charge and rotational parameter. Additionally, we highlight the impact of the Manko-Ruiz parameter on the shadow deformation, offering new insights into its role in shaping the Kerr-Sen-Taub-NUT spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Quasinormal modes around regular black holes and wormholes in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar and massless Dirac fields in the background of regular black holes and traversable wormholes arising in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity. Using both the JWKB approximation and time-domain integration, we analyze the impact of quantum corrections on the quasinormal spectra and late-time behavior of perturbations. Our results reveal the existence of slowly decaying, oscillatory tails and quasi-resonant modes in the scalar sector, particularly in the high-mass regime. In the fermionic case, the damping rate increases with the quantum correction parameter $ \xi $, while the oscillation frequency decreases. We also observe pronounced echo-like structures in the time-domain profiles near the black hole-wormhole threshold. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of perturbations in quantum-corrected spacetimes and offer potential signatures for distinguishing black holes from wormholes in future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering signatures of Kerr-Sen black holes in presence of plasma from the Event Horizon Telescope data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work explores the role of the dilaton charge $r_2$ and the plasma environment in explaining the observed images of M87* and Sgr A*. Dilaton charges are associated with Kerr-Sen black holes, the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity which arise in the low energy effective action of superstring theories. We investigate the impact of the background spacetime (here dilaton charge and spin) and the plasma environment in modifying the shape and size of the black hole shadow. The theoretically derived shadow is compared with the observed images of M87* and Sgr A* which enables us to constrain the background spacetime in presence of the plasma environment. Our analysis reveals that the shadow of M87* favors the Kerr scenario and rules out $r_2&gt;0.48$, while the shadow of Sgr A* exhibits a marginal preference towards the Kerr-Sen scenario (although GR is allowed within 1-$\sigma$) and rules out $r_2&gt;1$. Thus, large values of dilaton charge are disfavored for M87* and Sgr A* and this result holds good irrespective of the inhomogeneous plasma environment. In fact, the presence of plasma further constrains the allowed parameter space of $r_2$ and within the observed 1-$\sigma$ interval, the present data cannot distinguish between the Kerr and the Kerr-Sen black holes with mild dilaton charges. Moreover, the shadows of M87* and Sgr A* rule out very dense inhomogeneous plasma environments surrounding these objects and hence, black holes with less dense plasma environments seem to be good sites to detect signatures of dilaton charge. These findings not only underscore the importance of considering plasma effects in shadow related studies but also provide a pathway for refining constraints on alternative gravitational theories using black hole observations.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime: a general analysis of Palatini theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive theoretical framework within the most general second-order Palatini theory to systematically analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves, providing robust support for using gravitational wave detectors to test and refine gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Imprints of extra dimensions in eccentric EMRI gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies regarding extra-dimensions have been of great interest in modern theoretical physics, including their observational consequences from future gravitational wave (GW) observatories. In this direction, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRI), attracting considerable interest in GW astronomy and fundamental physics, can potentially provide a useful platform for the search of extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine a rotating braneworld black hole in the context of equatorial eccentric EMRI and attempt to provide an order of magnitude analysis for the extra-dimensional parameter termed "tidal charge". We estimate GW fluxes for the dominant mode and determine the impact of the tidal charge parameter on the orbital evolution. We further evaluate the prospects of detecting such a parameter through mismatch computation. We observe a significant enhancement in the mismatch as the value of orbital eccentricity or tidal charge parameter increases; the phenomenon becomes more obvious for rapidly rotating massive black holes. Thus, the study suggests that eccentric EMRI can potentially probe the existence of extra dimensions with future low-frequency detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Raychaudhuri equation and Gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of gravitational waves is independent of any specific theory of gravity. This is revealed by the Raychaudhuri equation (RE), which is independent of any theory of gravity and contains the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ as a key ingredient. RE relates certain fundamental geometric properties of spacetime to $R_{\mu\nu}$. We show that in the context of small perturbations of the metric tensor, the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ is proportional to the metric perturbations $\Box{h_{\mu\nu}}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the perturbation. Therefore, as different theories of gravity will give different equations of motion involving the Ricci tensor, the relevant wave equations satisfied by the metric perturbations will also be different. In the context of Einstein's gravity, we get the usual gravitational wave equations. However, for other different theories of gravity, the field equations involving the Ricci tensor are different, and hence the relevant wave equations for metric perturbations are also different. Consequently, the nature of gravitational waves will be different from those of Einstein's gravity. Here we give examples from $\it f(R)$ gravity and $\it f(R, T)$ gravity. Thus, the RE in the context of small perturbation of the metric opens up whole new vistas of {\it observational astronomy.}</description>

      <title>Second-Order Self-Force for Eccentric Extreme-Mass Ratio Inspirals on Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI), which corresponding to a small compact object inspirals around a Massive Black Hole (MBH) in the center of a galaxy, is one of the most important kind of source for future space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as TianQin and LISA. By analyzing the emitted GW signals, we can probe the theory of gravity and the nature of black holes (BHs) in the strong field region. To achieve these objectives, the second order self-force effect should be considered in the waveform modelling. Up to now, the waveform of EMRIs including the second order self-force effect is only achieved for the circular orbit on Schwarzschild background. In this work, we generalized the calculation of the second order self-force to the eccentric orbits on Schwarzschild spacetime. We calculated the puncture field, and give the form of two timescale expansion for the field equations. The corresponding numerical calculation and programming can be performed based on these results.</description>

      <title>Impact of Massive Black Hole Binaries Source Confusion on Uncertainties of Parameters Estimation in Space-based Gravitational Wave Detection for the TaiJi Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigates the impact of source confusion on parameter estimation for massive black hole binaries in the context of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave mission. Three representative MBHB population models, such as PopIII, Q3d, and Q3nod, are considered. By performing high-precision numerical simulations and employing both the Fisher information matrix and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, we quantitatively assess the uncertainties in parameter estimation. Source confusion primarily arises from overlapping time-frequency tracks of multiple signals. We find that when the relative difference in detector-frame chirp masses between two signals is less than 0.2 percent, the uncertainty in parameter estimation increases significantly. However, this degradation can be substantially mitigated by incorporating higher-order modes into the waveform model. Furthermore, using full Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the clear advantage of higher-order modes in reducing systematic biases in parameter recovery. These results provide important guidance for future data analysis strategies in space-based gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg AdS/dS Black Holes in the light of Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes $ M87^{*} $ and Sgr A$^{*}$ by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have sparked intensified interest in studying the optical appearance of black holes (BHs). Inspired by this, we carry out a study on the optical features of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-Anti de Sitter/de Sitter (EEH-AdS/dS) BHs, including the trajectories of photons, shadow geometrical shape, energy emission rate, and deflection of light in this spacetime. Since, due to the nonlinear electrodynamics effects, photons propagate along null geodesics in an effective metric rather than the background metric, we first derive the effective metric of the EEH-AdS/dS BH. Then we study the null geodesics of the resulting effective metric and eventually compute the size of the EEH-AdS/dS BH shadow. To validate our results, we confront our results with the extracted information from EHT data of the supermassive BHs $ M87^{*} $ and estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel stochastic variational method (SVM) for quantizing non-relativistic spinless particles in curved spaces with torsion. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited for quantization in general coordinate systems and shows that torsion, typically associated with spin, can influence the quantum dynamics of spinless particles through quantum fluctuations. In a flat space, this torsion-induced effect appears as a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation, which is relevant to studies of solitons, wave function collapse, and possible modifications to conventional quantum mechanics. Since torsion arises in various modified gravity theories, particularly those related to the early universe and dark matter, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which such effects may impact quantum behavior. We also provide a rough estimate for the upper bound of the torsion magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement harvesting protocol within the context of cylindrical gravitational waves given first by Einstein and Rosen, focusing on the interactions between non-relativistic quantum systems and linearized quantum gravity. We study how two spatially separated detectors can extract entanglement from the specific spacetime in the presence of gravitational waves, which provides a precise quantification of the entanglement that can be harvested using these detectors. In particular, we obtain the relation between harvested entanglement and the distance to wave sources that emits gravitational waves and analyze the detectability using quantum Fisher information. The enhanced detectability demonstrates the advantages of cylindrical symmetric gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Vectorization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Vector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Vector (EBIV) model, where a massless vector field is nonminimally coupled to a nonlinear Born-Infeld (BI) electromagnetic field. This coupling results in an effective mass for the vector field in a Born-Infeld black hole (BIBH) background, triggering tachyonic instability. We numerically construct and analyze such vectorized Born-Infeld black holes (VBIBHs), focusing on their domain of existence, thermodynamic properties, and energy distributions in both Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN)-like and Schwarzschild-like backgrounds.
  In RN-like BI backgrounds, vectorized solutions emerge from the perturbative instability threshold and persist down to extremality, exhibiting higher entropy and lower free energy compared to their unvectorized counterparts. Conversely, in Schwarzschild-like backgrounds, VBIBHs show bifurcation behavior with two coexisting solution branches, only one of which is thermodynamically favored. We reveal a contrasting energy redistribution pattern between the internal and external fields in the two regimes, governed by the competition between the vector field and the nonlinear BI field. Our findings highlight the rich structure of spontaneous vectorization in nonlinear electrodynamics and provide novel insights into black hole physics beyond linear Maxwell theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational metamaterials from optical properties of spacetime media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational optical properties are here investigated under the hypothesis of spherically-symmetric spacetimes behaving as media. To do so, we first consider two different definitions of the refractive index, $n_O$, of a spacetime medium and show how to pass from one definition to another by means of a coordinate transformation. Accordingly, the corresponding physical role of $n_O$ is discussed by virtue of the Misner-Sharp mass and the redshift definition. Afterwards, we discuss the inclusion of the electromagnetic fields and the equivalence with nonlinear effects induced by geometry. Accordingly, the infrared and ultraviolet gravity regimes are thus discussed, obtaining bounds from the Solar System, neutron stars and white dwarfs, respectively. To do so, we also investigate the Snell's law and propose how to possibly distinguish regular solutions from black holes. As a consequence of our recipe, we speculate on the existence of \emph{gravitational metamaterials}, whose refractive index may be negative and explore the corresponding physical implications, remarking that $n_O&lt;0$ may lead to invisible optical properties, as light is bent in the opposite direction compared to what occurs in ordinary cases. Further, we conjecture that gravitational metamaterials exhibit a particle-like behavior, contributing to dark matter and propose three toy models, highlighting possible advantages and limitations of their use. Finally, we suggest that such particle-like configurations can be ``dressed" by interaction, giving rise to \emph{geometric quasiparticles}. We thus construct modifications of the quantum propagator as due to nonminimal couplings between curvature and external matter-like fields, finding the corresponding effective mass through a boson mixing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics-based on Airy function approximations-which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius-as it is in electromagnetic lensing-making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>A parametrized spin-precessing inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for tests of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs) provides a unique arena to test general relativity (GR) in the dynamical, strong-field regime. To this end, we present pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform model for BBHs in quasicircular orbits, built within the effective-one-body formalism. Compared to its predecessor, pSEOBNRv4HM, our model introduces parametrized deviations from GR not only in the plunge-merger-ringdown stages, but also in the inspiral phase through modifications to the conservative dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates, for the first time, spin-precession effects. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR using current and future gravitational-wave observations. We validate pSEOBNRv5PHM through Bayesian parameter estimation, focusing on the quasinormal-mode frequency and damping time of the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$ mode. Our analysis of synthetic signals from numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of highly precessing BH mergers shows that, while pSEOBNRv5PHM correctly recovers consistency with GR, neglecting spin precession can lead to false detections of deviations from GR even at current detector sensitivity. Conversely, when analyzing a synthetic signal from a NR simulation of a binary boson-star merger, the model successfully identifies a deviation from a GR BBH signal. Finally, we reanalyze 12 events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Using a hierarchical combination of these events, we constrain fractional deviations in the frequency and damping time of the $(2,2,0)$ quasinormal-mode to $\delta f_{220}=0.00_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ and $\delta \tau_{220}=0.15_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ at 90% credibility. These results are consistent with those from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, which did not account for spin-precession effects.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Eccentric Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly eccentric binary neutron star mergers exhibit unique dynamical and observational signatures compared to quasi-circular ones in terms of their gravitational wave signal and the ejection of matter, leading to different electromagnetic counterparts. In this article, we present general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star systems on highly eccentric orbits. While in quasi-circular binaries, the influence of the magnetic field is too weak to affect the general pre-merger dynamics, the close encounters in eccentric systems could potentially trigger magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities. Therefore, we investigate possible effects before, during, and after the merger for a total of three different systems with varying initial eccentricity.
  We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close encounters and find good agreement with predicted f-mode frequency estimates. However, our simulations reveal no significant differences compared to results neglecting the magnetic field. Although we observe a rearrangement of the poloidal structure of the magnetic field inside the stars, there is no relevant increase in the magnetic energy during the encounters. Also, during the merger, the amplification of the magnetic field seems to be largely independent of the eccentricity in our systems. Consistent with studies of merging non-magnetized binary neutron stars, we find a correlation between eccentricity and mass ejection, with a higher impact parameter leading to a larger amount of unbound material.</description>

      <title>Eccentric mergers of binary Proca stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical relativity study of eccentric mergers of equal-mass rotating $\bar m=1$ Proca stars, focusing on their gravitational-wave (GW) emission. By systematically varying key binary parameters, such as the initial orbital boost, which determines the orbital angular momentum, and the relative phase between the stars, we examine how the internal phase structure of the Proca field influences the merger dynamics and the properties of the emitted GWs. Our simulations demonstrate that the relative phase has paramount impact on the post-merger evolution, resulting in prompt black hole formation accompanied by a transient Proca remnant, the formation of a hypermassive $\bar m=1$ Proca star or even the emergence of a dynamically-unstable spinning $\bar m=2$ Proca star. Under certain conditions, the GW signal exhibits significant odd-modes (e.g., the $\ell=m=3$ mode) that are absent in conventional black hole mergers, potentially serving as unique signatures of these exotic objects. Our findings offer new insights into the phenomenology of bosonic star mergers and the potential astrophysical role of ultralight bosonic fields.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced emergence of the Fermi scale in quantum quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of asymptotic safety, we study quantum quadratic gravity in the presence of the Higgs field considered as non-separable from the vacuum. The theory flows to a high energy fixed point where the Higgs field is strongly coupled to gravity, its potential is symmetric, and the quadratic Weyl curvature coupling is large. The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable high mass resonance which renders unitarity in the spirit of Lee-Week type theories. Furthermore, if the scalar graviton is tachyonic then there will be a low energy fixed point where tachyonic condensation leads to a new stable vacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges, and the behavior of the Higgs field is classical (not influenced by gravitational interaction). Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadratic whereas at the Fermi scale it is linear, and in the intermediate region both contributions are relevant. Thus, at the Fermi scale the quadratic curvature fields disappear through the ghost instability and tachyon condensation, giving rise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee cosmology: The FLRW solution and the CMB temperature anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put into test the idea of replacing dark energy by a vector field against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation using the simplest vector-tensor theory, where a massive vector field couples to the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor quadratically. First, a remarkable Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric solution that is completely independent of the matter-energy compositions of the universe is found. Second, based on the FLRW solution as well as the perturbation equations, a numerical code calculating the CMB temperature power spectrum is built. We find that though the FLRW solution can mimic the evolution of the universe in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the calculated CMB temperature power spectrum shows unavoidable discrepancies from the CMB power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Black hole via Thin Accretion Disks and Shadows with EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the shadows and thin accretion disks of Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) black hole. Firstly, we investigated the influence of EMS parameters on the black hole shadow using the null geodesic method and constrained these parameters based on EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*. Furthermore, we analyzed the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring structures in EMS black hole. Comparing our results with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$m (RN) black holes, we found that the Schwarzschild black hole exhibits the largest shadow radius and the highest observed intensity. Increasing the EMS model parameters leads to a reduction in intensity. Ultimately, our findings suggest that imaging black hole accretion disks does not clearly distinguish among these three types of black holes.</description>

      <title>Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose a black hole forms from a pure quantum state $\ket{\psi}$. The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting that, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and evaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region $\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <title>GWSurrogate: A Python package for gravitational wave surrogate models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate waveform models are fundamentally important to modern gravitational wave astrophysics, enabling the study of merging compact objects like black holes and neutron stars. However, generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms through numerical relativity simulations is computationally intensive, often requiring days to months of computation time on supercomputers. Surrogate models provide a practical solution to dramatically accelerate waveform evaluations (typically tens of milliseconds per evaluation) while retaining the accuracy of computationally expensive simulations. The GWSurrogate Python package provides easy access to these gravitational wave surrogate models through a user-friendly interface. Currently, the package supports 16 surrogate models, each varying in duration, included physical effects (e.g., nonlinear memory, tidal forces, harmonic modes, eccentricity, mass ratio range, precession effects), and underlying solution methods (e.g., Effective One Body, numerical relativity, black hole perturbation theory). GWSurrogate models follow the waveform model conventions used by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration, making the package immediately suitable for both theoretical studies and practical gravitational wave data analysis. By enabling rapid and precise waveform generation, GWSurrogate serves as a production-level tool for diverse applications, including parameter estimation, template bank generation, and tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on QCD-based equation of state of quark stars from neutron star maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) Neutron stars (NSs), the densest known objects composed of matter, provide a unique laboratory to probe whether strange quark matter is the true ground state of matter. We investigate the parameter space of the equation of state of strange stars using a quantum chromodynamics (QCD)-informed model. The parameters - related to the energy density difference between quark matter and the QCD vacuum, the strength of strong interactions, and the gap parameter for color superconductivity - are sampled via quasi-random Latin hypercube sampling to ensure uniform coverage. To constrain them, we incorporate observational data on the maximum mass of NSs (from binary and merger systems), the radii of $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$ NSs (from gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations), and tidal deformabilities (from GW170817). Our results show that quark strong interactions play a key role, requiring at least a $20\%$ deviation from the free-quark limit. We also find that color superconductivity is relevant, with the gap parameter reaching up to $\sim 84$ MeV for a strange quark mass of $100$ MeV. The surface-to-vacuum energy density jump lies in the range $(1.1-1.3)$ $\rho_{\rm{sat}}$, where $\rho_{\rm{sat}} \simeq 2.7 \times 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Observational constraints also imply that a $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$ quark star has a radius of $(11.5-12.3)$ km and tidal deformability between $670$ and $970$. These are consistent with the low mass and radius inferred for the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518. Our results provide useful inputs for future studies on quark and hybrid stars, including their tidal properties, thermal evolution, quasi-normal modes, and ellipticities.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Nonlinear Gravity on the Cosmological Background During Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical relativity to study the violent preheating era at the end of inflation. This epoch can result in highly nonlinear fluctuations in density and gravitational potential which feed back onto the averaged expansion rate -- an effect known as backreaction. Usually, simulations of preheating use the Friedmann constraint to enforce the Hubble expansion of spacetime during the evolution. In numerical relativity, this is not required and the inhomogeneous spacetime is evolved self-consistently. For a 'vanilla' preheating model, we find a violation of the Friedmann constraint at the level of $0.005\%$ over the entire simulation. This violation increases to $\sim10\%$ as we sample smaller scales in the simulation domain.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dark energy models using late-universe observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, dark energy was proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration. A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in constraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a comparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current data. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC analysis indicates that all dark energy models outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier penalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy models are robustly supported by AIC while being explicitly disfavored by BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and not explicitly disfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark energy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity model exhibits superior performance when compared with $\Lambda$CDM from both the AIC and BIC perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological constraints of the time variation of the electron mass $m_e$ and the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, using data of cosmic microwave background, supernovae light curve and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data including the recent DESI BAO DR2 measurements. The results are slightly depending on the BAO data set included in the analysis. The latest DESI BAO DR2 data strongly indicates that $m_e$ or $\alpha$ is slightly larger than the previous data from 6DF+SDSS and DESI BAO DR1. We also compare the varying $m_e$ model, the varying $\alpha$ model, and the simultaneous variation of $m_e$ and $\alpha$. When considering the Hubble tension, a larger electron mass is the most promising option and the variation of the fine-structure constants does not alleviate the tension.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Leading soft theorems on plane wave backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Decaying vacuum energy, matter creation and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an interacting decaying vacuum energy and dark matter empowered by gravitationally induced matter creation model, and its impact on structure formation by analysing the growth rate perturbations. Our work is motivated by the possibility that the decaying vacuum is due to quantum field theory and dark matter originates from gravitationally induced matter creation. We delve deeper into our investigation and explore both theoretical and statistical analysis of the cosmological model to test its ability to describe the evolution of the Universe. To achieve this, we use three distinct combinations of datasets from CC, Pantheon SNIa sample, BAO, CMB distance priors and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ datapoints to constrain the model parameters. Our statistical analysis employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The deceleration parameter shows that the model transitions from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase of expansion. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_0=67.517 \pm 0.869$ km/s/Mpc, $H_0=67.534\pm 0.874$ km/s/Mpc, and $H_0=67.533 \pm 0.884$ km/s/Mpc using DS1, DS2 and DS3 datasets, respectively. These values of $H_0$ are very close to those derived from the Planck data. The effective equation of state parameter indicates an accelerating phase, with density parameter for vacuum energy exhibiting expected values. We analyse the stability characteristics through the selection information criteria. We also perform thermodynamic analysis by studying the evolution of entropy in the Universe for the model and find it to be in agreement with the generalized second law of thermodynamics. These findings support that the proposed model effectively describes the evolutionary features of the Universe at both theoretical and observational levels.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a localized quantum system living in a curved spacetimes. By translating into this scenario the paradgmatic two-point measument scheme in quantum statistical mechanics we are able to prove a relativistic version of the quantum flutuation theorem. One of the consequences of such a theorem is that entropy production is deeply observer dependent. The main ideas of this chapter are published in [M. L. W. Basso, J. Maziero and L. C. C\'eleri. The irreversibility of relativistic time-dilation. Class. Quantum Grav. \textbf{40}, 195001 (2023); M. L. W. Basso, J. Maziero and L. C. C\'eleri.

      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi_{3}&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi_{3}&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in a Fractal Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses the influence of galaxy mergers in the evolution of a parabolic Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) cosmology with simultaneous big bang endowed with two consecutive single fractal galaxy distributions systems possessing fractal dimension $D$. Based on recent empirical findings, it is assumed that the resulting galaxy mass from mergers can be expressed by a redshift dependent decaying power law. The proposed cosmological model modifies the relativistic fractal number counts distribution by including a merger rate evolution that estimates the model's radial density. Numerical solutions for the first order small-merger-rate approximation (SMRA) are found and the results show that a fractal galaxy distribution having $D=1.5$ in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0$, and $D=0.5$ for $1&lt;z&lt;6$, as suggested by recent empirical findings, the SMRA allows consistent description of the model for a merger rate power law exponent up to $q=0.2$ considering a fractal galaxy distribution starting from the Local Group. Consistent values were also found up to $q=2.5$ and $z=7$ from a scale smaller than the Local Supercluster. These results show that galaxy mergers can be successfully incorporated into the dynamics of a parabolic LTB fractal cosmology.</description>

      <title>Improved null tests of $\Lambda$CDM and FLRW in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI DR2 BAO data exclude the flat $\Lambda$CDM model at more than 2.5$\sigma$, depending on different data combinations when analyzed through the $w_0w_a$CDM parametrization. This simple parametrization may introduce bias in the results. We use null tests that probe for deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM at late times, independent of any specific dark energy parametrization. We provide several diagnostics for null tests and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we derive diagnostics that improve on previous ones, such as the popular $O_{\rm m}$ diagnostic. The diagnostics are derived from both background and perturbed quantities. Using the combination of DESI DR2 BAO and supernova data, with or without CMB data, we find that deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM are at $\sim1\sigma$ confidence level in most of the redshift range (more than 1$\sigma$ for a few small redshift intervals in a few cases). These deviations are minor for other non-DESI SDSS-IV BAO data combined with Pantheon+, with or without CMB data. Since spatial curvature can potentially modify the results, we also test for curvature in the general $\Lambda$CDM model and the general FLRW model. While there is slight evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature at lower redshifts in a general $\Lambda$CDM model, there is no statistically significant evidence in a general FLRW model.</description>

      <title>The gravitational index of a small black ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain supersymmetric elementary string states with angular momentum can be viewed as small black rings in a five-dimensional string theory. These black rings have zero area event horizon. The 4D-5D connection relates these small rings to small black holes without angular momentum in one less dimension. Recent works have proposed saddle solutions that compute the supersymmetric index for small black holes using gravitational path integral. In this paper, we propose an analogous saddle solution for a five-dimensional small black ring. The dominant contribution comes from a black ring saddle that rotates in both independent planes in five dimensions and has a finite area event horizon. We also write the saddle solution as a three-center Bena-Warner solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical expressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various time-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves demonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10^{-14}\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>

      <title>Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. To do so, we establish an intrinsic gauge-fixing procedure for the geometric data, which allows us to derive the extended BMS symmetries and the correct transformation law of the shear, encoded in the connection. Our analysis reveals that the invariant Lagrangians are always topological, thereby reducing the 4d bulk to a 2d boundary theory. Moreover, we find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. This BMS field theory is dual to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes when the superrotation anomalies coincide and are dictated by the bulk. Meanwhile, the absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory, intrinsic and independent of bulk considerations, offering further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime torsion source an extremely red-tilted cosmological GW background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, any generic $f(R)$ model of gravity is conformally dual to a scalar-tensor theory augmented with a second rank antisymmetric massless degree of freedom. We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second order by such a torsional field, treated perturbatively during an epoch of canonical, single-field, slow-roll inflation. The resulting second-order induced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at all scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies, and is found to be extremely red-tilted with an effective tensor spectral index $\alpha_{\rm T}\sim-6$ on matter-dominated scales. The signal is potentially within the reach of upcoming indirect GW probes on very large scales $k\lesssim10^{-2}\:\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, i.e., next-generation CMB experiments like the LiteBIRD. In the near future, observation of such a markedly red-tilted SGWB on CMB scales could hence provide a novel and unique clue in favour of torsional gravity during the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the primordial Universe without calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $\sim10\%$ using $\sim10^3$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $7\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $10\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $15\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

      <title>Implications of distance duality violation for the $H_0$ tension and evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether a violation of the distance duality relation (DDR), $D_L(z) = (1+z)^2 D_A(z)$, connecting the angular diameter and luminosity distances, can explain the Hubble tension and alter the evidence for dynamical dark energy in recent cosmological observations. We constrain five phenomenological parameterisations of DDR violation using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the DESI survey calibrated with the sound horizon derived from \textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNIa) catalogue calibrated with the supernova absolute magnitude from S$H_0$ES. We find that two toy models can resolve the tension: a constant offset in the DDR (equivalent to a shift in the calibration of the SNIa data), $D_L(z)/D_A(z)\simeq 0.925(1+z)^2$, which leaves the hint for evolving dark energy unaffected; or a change in the power-law redshift-dependence of the DDR, restricted to $z\lesssim 1$, $D_L(z)/D_A(z)\simeq(1+z)^{1.866}$, together with a {\it constant} phantom dark energy equation of state $w\sim -1.155$. The Bayesian evidence slightly favours the latter model. Our phenomenological approach motivates the investigation of physical models of DDR violation as a novel way to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with the angular cross-correlation of gravitational-wave and galaxy catalogs: forecasts for next-generation interferometers and the Euclid survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the angular power spectrum of gravitational-wave and galaxy catalogs in tomographic redshift and distance bins as a probe of late-time cosmology, focusing specifically on next-generation ground-based interferometers in combination with the Euclid photometric survey. We assess the potential of this technique to constrain the Hubble constant and the matter energy density. Our analysis incorporates realistic gravitational-wave source populations, error modelling calibrated on recent detector designs, and accounts for nuisance parameters. We show that the tomographic angular cross-correlation could determine the Hubble constant to percent or sub-percent precision depending on the binning choice, configuration and operation time of gravitational-wave observatories. This conclusion holds even when marginalising over the unknown tracer biases, primordial power-spectrum parameters and baryon density. In particular, we show that the combination of the galaxy auto-correlation spectra and the cross-correlation of gravitational waves and galaxy surveys can lead to an improvement of up to a factor ${{\sim}}10$ in constraining power over either of the two probes taken individually. However, this prospect crucially relies on the presence of multiple gravitational-wave interferometers able to yield precise sky localisation. We also discuss the use of a spectroscopic redshift catalog, as well as the detectability of the clustering bias of gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <title>Dipolar tidal effects in gravitational waves from scalarized black hole binary inspirals in quadratic gravity</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging binary black holes (BHs) enable unprecedented tests of gravitational theories beyond Einstein's General Relativity (GR) in highly nonlinear, dynamical regimes. Such GW measurements require an accurate description of GW signatures that may arise in alternative gravitational models. In this work, we focus on a class of higher-curvature extensions of GR, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, where BHs can develop scalar hair. In an inspiraling binary system, this leads to scalar-induced tidal effects in the dynamics and radiation. We calculate the dominant adiabatic dipolar tidal effects via an approximation scheme based on expansions in post-Newtonian, higher-curvature, and tidal corrections. The tidal effects depend on a characteristic scalar Love number, which we compute using BH perturbation theory, and have the same scaling with GW frequency as the higher-curvature corrections. We perform case studies to characterize the net size and parameter dependencies of these effects, showing that at low frequencies, tidal effects dominate over the higher-curvature contributions for small couplings within current bounds, regardless of the total BH mass, while at high frequencies they are subdominant. We further consider prospects observing both of these regimes, which would be interesting for breaking parameter degeneracies, with multiband detections of LISA and ground-based detectors or the Einstein Telescope alone. We also assess the frequency range of the transition between these regimes by numerically solving the energy balance law. Our results highlight the importance of the dipolar scalar tidal effects for BHs with scalar hair, which arise in several beyond-GR paradigms, and provide ready-to-use inputs for improved GW constraints on Gauss-Bonnet theories.</description>

      <title>On the microstructure of higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in quantum regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic Riemannian geometry provides great insights into the microscopic structure of black holes (BHs). One such example is the Ruppeiner geometry which is the metric space comprising the second derivatives of entropy with respect to other extensive variables of the system. Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes (RNBHs) are known to be endowed with a flat Ruppeiner geometry for all higher spacetime dimensions. However this holds true if one invokes classical gravity where the semi-classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy best describes the thermodynamics of the system. If the much deeper quantum gravity and string theories entail modifications to BH entropy, this prompts the question whether the Ruppeiner flatness associated with higher dimensional RNBHs still persists. We investigate this problem by considering non-perturbative (exponential) and perturbative (logarithmic) modifications to BH entropy of a 5D RNBH. We find that while the case is so for larger (classical) geometries, the situation is radically altered for smaller (quantum) geometries. Namely, we show surprising emergence of multiple phase transitions that depend on the choice of extent of corrections to BH entropy and charge. Our consideration involves differentiated extremal and non-extremal geometric scales corresponding to the validity regime of corrections to entropy.
  More emphasis is laid on the exponential case as the contributions become highly non-trivial on small scales. An essential critical mass scale arises in this case that marks the onset of these phase transitions while the BH diminishes in size via Hawking evaporation. We contend that this critical value of mass perhaps best translates as the epoch of a classical to quantum BH phase transition.</description>

      <title>Constraining the effective field theory of dark energy with multimessenger astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory of dark energy predicts a possible time variation of the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GW) which could be tested with multimessenger astronomy.For this purpose we derive the relation between the redshift dependence of the propagation speed of GWs and the time delay between the detection of GWs and electromagnetic waves (EMWs) emitted by the same source. According to the EFT the friction term of the GW propagation equation depends on the effective Planck mass and GW speed time variation, affecting the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio.
  We compute the general form of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio in terms of the effective GW speed and effective Planck mass, and then focus on theories with constant Planck mass (CPM) and time varying GW speed. For CPM theories the GW speed can be jointly constrained by the GW-EMW detection time delay and luminosity distance ratio, allowing to derive a consistency relation between these two observables. The event GW170817 and its EM counterpart satisfy the CPM consistency condition, and allows to set constraints on the time variation of the GWs speed, and consequently on the coefficients of the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

Abstract: As an alternative to the "no hair conjecture," the "no short hair conjecture" for hairy black holes was established earlier. This theorem stipulates that hair must be present above 3/2 of the event horizon radius for a hairy black hole. It is assumed that the nonlinear behavior of the matter field plays a key role in the presence of such hair. Subsequently, it was established that the hair must extend beyond the photon sphere of the corresponding black hole. We have investigated the validity of the "no short hair conjecture" in pure Lovelock gravity. Our analysis has shown that irrespective of dimensionality and Lovelock order, the hair of a static, spherically symmetric black hole extends at least up to the photon sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave (GW) emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence, with LIGO detections since GW150914 showing the radiated energy $E_{\mathrm{GW}}$ scales approximately as one-tenth of the chirp mass: $\sim\mathcal{M}/10$. While evident in numerical relativity, this scaling lacks a simple analytical form without ad hoc assumptions. We model the binary as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume, and from the energy density of a gravitating body with torsion we yield a classical peak radiated energy of $E_\mathrm{GW}=(5/48)\mathcal{M}$. Refining this via stochastic gravity, we treat first-order metric perturbations as graviton fluctuations, applying relativistic kinetic theory to a Bose-Einstein-distributed graviton gas. This derives the peak radiated energy at the chirp mass as the gas' effective thermal energy: $E_\mathrm{GW}\simeq 0.11296\mathcal{M}$, matching LIGO data with 1:1 ratios of 0.851--0.998. This quantum-classical correspondence suggests graviton gas kinematics (e.g., GW/graviton wave-particle duality, high-energy graviton-graviton scattering) and invites noise analysis and post-coalescence studies.</description>

Abstract: We analyze scalar field dark energy models minimally and non-minimally coupled to gravity, postulating that a Yukawa-like interacting term is \emph{in form} equivalent for general relativity, teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories. Our analysis is pursued within two scalar field representations, where a quintessence and phantom pictures are associated with quasiquintessence and quasiphantom exotic fields. In the latter, we suggest how the phion-pressure can be built up without exhibiting a direct kinetic term. Accordingly, the stability analysis reveals that this quasiquintessence field provides a viable description of the universe indicating, when minimally coupled, how to unify dark energy and dark matter by showing an attractor point where $w_{\phi}=0$. Conversely, in the non-minimally coupling, the alternative field only leaves an attractor where dark energy dominates, mimicking \emph{de facto} a cosmological constant behavior. A direct study is conducted comparing the standard case with the alternative one, overall concluding that the behavior of quintessence is well established across all the gravity scenarios. However, considering the phantom field non-minimal coupled to gravity, the results are inconclusive for power-law potentials in Einstein theory, and for the inverse square power (ISP) potential in both teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories. Finally, we study the growth of matter perturbations and establish that only the fifth power and quadratic potentials, when used to describe quasiphantom field minimally coupled to gravity, exhibit behavior similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction can flip the hierarchical three-body system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the long-term effects of non-linear perturbations were found to be important for the evolution of the hierarchical triple system, which, for the central third body of a larger mass, can significantly suppress the occurrences of orbital flip that changes the sign of angular momentum of the inner binary. However, as the third-body mass increases significantly, the ambient dark matter spike becomes much denser, rendering the effect of dynamical friction non-negligible. In this work, we take the dynamical friction into account for the first time in the hierarchical triple system up to the octupole order and find that the suppressed occurrences of orbital flip could be recovered, and as the spike index increases, the number of flips could increase over a period of time; meanwhile, as both the inner and outer semi-major axes increase while keeping their ratio fixed, the number of flips could also increase over the same number of outer orbital periods, making the detection of orbital flip a potential probe of the dark matter via observations of either electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as Bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors into Bilby, based on the 95% confidence intervals of the CVAE posterior for the lensing parameters, reduces Bilby's average runtime by around 48% without any penalty on accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute tidal signatures in the gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star binary inspirals in scalar-tensor gravity, where the dominant adiabatic even-parity tidal interactions involve three types of Love numbers that depend on the matter equation of state and parameters of the gravitational theory. We calculate the modes of the GW amplitudes and the phase evolution in the time and frequency domain, working up to first order in the post-Newtonian and small finite-size approximations. We also perform several case studies to quantify the dipolar and quadrupolar tidal effects and their parameter dependencies specialized to Gaussian couplings. We show that various tidal contributions enter with different signs and scalings with frequency, which generally leads to smaller net tidal GW imprints than for the same binary system in General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: DWs represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of GWs produced by scalar perturbations generated from the DW network. Our findings indicate that the GW spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future GW experiments aimed at exploring the role of DWs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate slow roll inflation and the creation of primordial density fluctuations in the framework of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. Our focus is on constraining the evolution of both the background and perturbations in this theory, specifically using the form $f(Q,T) = \alpha Q + g(T)$, where $g(T)$ is an arbitrary function of the trace of the stress-energy tensor $T$. We derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations for scalar and tensor perturbations, and by solving these equations in the slow-roll regime, we compute the power spectra and spectral index for both modes within the general functional framework of $g(T)$. In particular, we examine power law functional forms of $g(T)$ to establish the observational constraints associated with quadratic potential. By imposing constraints on the model's parameters, we obtain results that align closely with the Planck 2018 data and BAO data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Notably, a model that includes $g(T) = \beta T^2$ and a quadratic potential yields the best-fit values consistent with the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio suggested by the Planck and BICEP2 results.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the problem of generalizing the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms for general quadratic theories of gravity and propose a simple condition to obtain them. From these terms we derive the junction conditions for a subset of this family of theories that includes Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity. We re-obtain the well-known results for GB theory, generalize them to other quadratic theories and compare the resulting junction conditions with the ones already derived in the literature using other methods</description>

      <title>Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions, and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model which represents a smooth perturbative expansion around the $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmological analysis is carried out by calculating the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, for selected values of the parameters. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM case. Several late-time cosmological parameters are computed, such as: dark energy state parameter, deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of the classical energy conditions WEC, SEC, NEC, and DEC for both the combination of matter and geometrical contribution and the geometrical contribution alone. Beyond the background level, linear matter perturbations are studied by calculating parameters relevant to structure growth and formation. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe by means late-time deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Inverse logarithmic correction in the HBAR entropy of an atom falling into a renormalization group improved charged black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have considered a spherically symmetric non-rotating charged black hole geometry where both the Newton's gravitational constant and the charge of the black hole flows with the energy scale. We have used the Kretschmann scale identification to write down the finite cutoff for the momentum scale in terms of the proper distance. Introducing the flow of running couplings, the event horizon radius of the black hole using quantum improved Reissner-Nordstrom metric was found in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.066016}{Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 066016}. We have, in this work, explored the thought experiment of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum improved charged black hole and have computed the transition probability of the atom for going from its ground state to the excited state via emission of a virtual photon. We find that the probability deviates slightly from the pure Planckian spectrum. We have showed that this deviation is due to the presence of incomplete lower gamma function in the distribution function. We have then computed the horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy and found that it is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy followed by the renormalization group correction terms including an inverse logarithmic and a square root of the area term due to emitting photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the role of the nonlocal effects is analogous to that of exotic matter in general relativity, owing to their quantum nature. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Paper I, we introduced the hybrid Relay, an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration designed to minimize null frequencies and enhance gravitational wave (GW) analysis for massive binary black holes (MBBHs). In Paper II, we further improved its noise characterization performance by replacing its null stream with a more stable channel, $C^{12}_3$. In this work, we present a novel TDI scheme, PD4L, which features minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid Relay or the second-generation Michelson which require delays up to $7L$ (with $L$ denoting the light-travel time between spacecraft), the PD4L uses delays no longer than $3L$, corresponding to a total time span of $4L$. This compact structure yields several advantages: 1) reducing data margins at segment boundaries, 2) mitigating aliasing in the high frequency regime, and 3) shortening the signal tails caused by long span. To evaluate PD4L's performance, we perform parameter inference for chirping GW signals from coalescing MBBHs. Our results show that the PD4L outperforms the hybrid Relay in the high frequency band and performs comparably at low frequencies. Moreover, PD4L's null stream exhibits the same minimal null frequencies as its science channels and maintains a more stable noise spectrum than $C^{12}_3$. While the noise spectra of its science channels are slightly less stable than those of the hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise parameters for data durations of up to four months. These results suggest PD4L as a promising TDI scheme, particularly well-suited for analyzing GW signal in the higher-frequency domain.</description>

Abstract: Inertia of a particle is due to its mass as well as intrinsic spin. The latter is revealed via the coupling of intrinsic spin with rotation. The spin-rotation coupling and the concomitant spin-gravity coupling are discussed in connection with the nature of inertia. The spin-rotation-gravity coupling leads to a gravitomagnetic Stern-Gerlach type of force on the particle that is independent of the particle's mass and thus violates the universality of free fall. This effect is extremely small and its measurement is beyond present capabilities.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Holes in Lovelock gravity with a Degenerate AdS Ground State and their shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Estrada:2024uuu}, a relationship between gravitational tension (GT) and energy density, via the Kretschmann scalar (KS), was recently proposed to construct regular black hole (RBH) solutions in Pure Lovelock (PL) gravity. However, in PL gravity it is not viable to include a negative cosmological constant, as this leads to the appearance of a potential curvature singularity \cite{Cai:2006pq}. In this work, by choosing a particular set of coupling constants such that the resulting equations of motion for Lovelock gravity admit an $n$-fold degenerate ground state (LnFDGS) AdS solution, we construct an RBH solution with $\Lambda &lt; 0$, providing an energy density model analogous to (but distinct in its definition of GT) the one previously mentioned. Moreover, since relating the gravitational tension to the KS of the vacuum LnFDGS solution is nontrivial, we provide an alternative definition of both the KS and the GT. Remarkably, we obtain a model where there exists a value $r_*$ slightly greater than the extremal radius, $r_* &gt; r_{ext}$, which could be on the order of the Planck length, such that the solutions of the vacuum AdS black hole and our AdS RBH become indistinguishable. However, at short length scales such that $r &lt; r_*$, quantum effects would arise, causing both cases to differ in their geometry (suppressing the central singularity) and their thermodynamic properties. Additionally, since it is not possible to find analytical relationships between the event horizon, the photon sphere radius, and the shadow size in LnFDGS, we propose a method to numerically and graphically obtain the aforementioned relationships and analyze their physical behavior. We also provide a speculative methodology to compare theoretical results from Lovelock gravity with experimental results from the EHT for M87.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>On Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes and Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent papers on spacetimes with a signature-changing metric, the concept of a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole and new elements for Lorentzian-Riemannian signature change have been introduced. A Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole is a signature-changing modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations in a weak sense. Here the event horizon serves as a boundary beyond which time becomes imaginary. We demonstrate that the proper time needed to reach the horizon remains finite, consistently with the classical Schwarzschild solution. About Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions, we stress that the hypersurface where the metric signature changes is naturally a spacelike hypersurface which can be identified with the future or past causal boundary of the Lorentzian sector. Moreover, a number of geometric interpretations appear, as the degeneracy of the metric corresponds to the collapse of the causal cones into a line, the degeneracy of the dual metric corresponds to collapsing into a hyperplane, and additional geometric structures on the transition hypersurface (Galilean and dual Galilean) might be explored.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating black hole in chiral scalar-tensor theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral scalar-tensor theory is an extension of the Chern-Simons modified gravity by introducing couplings between the first and second derivatives of the scalar field and parity-violating spacetime curvatures. A key feature of this theory is its explicit breaking of parity symmetry in the gravitational sector, which is expected to affect the spatial-time component of axisymmetric spacetime. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the chiral scalar-tensor theory on slowly rotating black holes by building on known solutions in the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. Using perturbative methods with small coupling and slow rotation approximations, we find that the contributions of the chiral scalar-tensor theory appear at quadratic order in the spin and cubic order in the coupling constants. Furthermore, we explore the properties of this solution in the weak field and check its ergosphere and horizon. In the weak limit, we find that the effects of parity violation are suppressed in the weak field but could become significant in the strong field regime. These results provide insights into the behavior of parity-violating gravity in the presence of rotation and may be used for further investigations into its observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Bound-Unbound Universality and the All-Order Semi-Classical Wave Function in Schwarzschild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for analytically computing time-dependent observables for a relativistic probe particle in Coulomb and Schwarzschild backgrounds. The method generates expressions valid both in the bound and unbound regimes, namely bound-unbound universal expressions. To demonstrate our method we compute the time-dependent radius and azimuthal angle for relativistic motion in a Coulomb background (relativistic Keplerian motion), as well as the electromagnetic field radiated by a relativistic Keplerian source. All of our calculations exhibit bound-unbound universality. Finally, we present an exact expression for the semi-classical wave function in Schwarzschild. The latter is crucial in applying our method to any time-dependent observable for probe-limit motion in Schwarzschild, to any desired order in velocity and the gravitational constant $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows that multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing their constraint precision by $60\%$-$90\%$ and $52\%$-$85\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries in partially ordered sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partially ordered sets (posets) play a universal role as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics. For finite posets, an explicit enumeration of distinct partial orders on a set of unlabelled elements is known only up to a cardinality of 16 (listed as sequence A000112 in the OEIS), but closed expressions are unknown. By considering the automorphisms of (finite) posets, I introduce a formulation of local symmetries. These symmetries give rise to a division operation on the set of posets and lead to the construction of symmetry classes that are easier to characterise and enumerate. Furthermore, we consider polynomial expressions that count certain subsets of posets with a large number of layers (a large height). As an application in physics, local symmetries or rather their absence helps to distinguish causal sets (locally finite posets) that serve as discrete spacetime models from generic causal sets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the coincidence between gravitational waves and fast radio bursts from neutron star - black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astrophysical transients whose origin and mechanism remain unclear. Compact object mergers may be a promising channel to produce some FRBs. Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers could produce FRBs through mechanisms involving neutron star tidal disruption or magnetospheric disturbances. This could present an opportunity for multi-messenger gravitational-wave observations, providing new insight into the nature of FRBs and nuclear matter. However, some of the gravitational-wave signals may be marginal detections with signal-to-noise ratios &lt; 8 or have large sky location and distance uncertainties, making it less straightforward to confidently associate an FRB with the gravitational-wave signal. One must therefore take care to avoid a false positive association. We demonstrate how to do this with simulated data. We calculate the posterior odds -- a measurement of our relative belief for a common versus unrelated origin of a coincident NSBH and FRB. We find that a coincident FRB+NSBH from a common source can yield a statistically significant posterior odds in a network with at least two observatories, but only if we require a coincidence in time and and sky location, rather than time alone. However, we find that for our model, we require a network signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 to be confident in the common-source detection, when using a threshold of ln odds &gt; 8. We suggest that a coincident NSBH+FRB detection could help distinguish between FRB engines by discriminating between disrupting and non-disrupting models.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional Weyl double copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy (WDC) relation connects the Weyl tensor of the gravity theory and the field strength tensor of the Maxwell theory, which provides a concrete realization of the classical double copy. Although intensively investigated, the WDC is only limited in four-dimensional spacetime. In this Letter, we generalize the WDC relation to five-dimensional spacetime, which offers the first example of the WDC in higher dimensions. We show that a special class of five-dimensional type N vacuum solutions admits a special class of degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. The five-dimensional WDC relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the source-free Klein-Gordon equation on the curved background. We further verify that for five-dimensional pp-wave solution and Kundt solutions, the Maxwell fields and the scalar fields also satisfy the Maxwell's equations and the wave equation on five-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we propose an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons. Black hole solutions with a ring curvature singularity in between their inner and outer horizons are also presented.</description>

Abstract: We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced during the radiation era after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$, which we find to be subdominant with respect to the former. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case, we consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fibre bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms: the View from Nowhere and the View from Everywhere. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting a complete reality itself. What emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a perspicuous relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Tensor Gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the implications of the DESI 2024 BAO data on scalar-tensor models of gravity. We consider four representative models: induced gravity (IG, equivalent to Jordan-Brans-Dicke), where we either fix today's value of the effective gravitational constant on cosmological scales to the Newton's constant or allow them to differ, Jordan-Brans-Dicke supplemented with a Galileon term (BDG), and early modified gravity (EMG) with a conformal coupling. In this way it is possible to investigate how different modified gravity models compare with each other when confronted with DESI 2024 BAO data. Compared to previous analyses, for all of these models, the combination of Planck and DESI data favors a larger value of the key parameter of the theory, such as the nonminimal coupling to gravity or the Galileon term, leading also to a larger value of $H_0$, due to the known degeneracy between these parameters. These new results are mainly driven by the first two redshift bins of DESI. In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models considered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results and reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\sigma$ (compared to $4.5\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>Transition between Schwarzschild black hole and string black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the quantum transition between a Schwarzschild black hole and a string black hole in the large $D$ limit. Classically, such a transition between these two distinct black hole geometries is forbidden. The only feasible discussion is centered on how a black hole evaporates, loses mass, and transitions into highly excited fundamental strings. Building upon our previous work on T-duality between the Schwarzschild and string black holes, we reduce the problem to two dimensions, where the corresponding Wheeler-De Witt equation can be derived. Using this equation, we identify the two black hole geometries as distinct wave function states. This allows us to easily compute the transition probability between these two geometries, driven by the string coupling.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in kappa-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>
