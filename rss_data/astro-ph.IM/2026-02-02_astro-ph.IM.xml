      <title>The Simons Observatory: On-sky performance of radio-transparent multi-layer insulation (RT-MLI) using Styroace-II Styrofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the on-sky performance of a Radio-Transparent Multi-Layer Insulation filter (RT-MLI) that uses Styroace-II styrofoam to reject ambient thermal radiation from entering a 0.42 m diameter aperture to a sub-100 mK bolometric detector array cooled by a dilution-refrigerator. We find that greater than 90% of the expected incident infra-red (IR) radiation is rejected, resulting in $&lt;$12 W of measured transmitted power. Transmitted power in the detector passbands is consistent with a lower bound of 95%. We address filter design and placement, thermal loading, and mm-wave transmission.</description>

      <title>HEP digital micromirror devices for precision solar spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the motivation and early tests for a novel solar instrument that will harness the new High Efficiency Pixel (HEP) Texas Instruments DLP801RE Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) as a reconfigurable spatial light modulator. This design enables real-time, dynamic configuration of the field of view for targeted spectroscopy of magnetically active regions and full-disk observations. Optical efficiency was validated through simulations and laser testing. Destructive window removal allowed for detailed structural analysis, confirming the elimination of central vias present in previous models. We measured a contrast ratio of 250:1, currently limited by the evaluation board's duty cycle rather than the DMD itself. Furthermore, we successfully simulated artificial planetary transits, recovering depths ranging from gas giants to a 40 ppm rocky planet transit. These results demonstrate the HEP DMD's potential for high-precision solar and exoplanetary science applications.</description>

      <title>Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.</description>

      <title>Constructing a gravitational wave analysis pipeline for extremely large mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), consisting of a brown dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole, emit long-lived and nearly monochromatic gravitational waves in the millihertz band and constitute a promising probe of strong-field gravity and black-hole properties. However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $&lt;10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\lesssim2\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the reception coefficients of cosmic rays neutron component for latitude measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When solving scientific and applied problems, such as latitude monitoring, it is important to correctly exclude primary cosmic ray variations from observation data. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and implement a method for correcting monitoring data, the key point of which was to obtain reception coefficients as a function of latitude. This resulted in an approximation of the rigidity dependence of the zeroth and first harmonic cosmic rays anisotropy coefficients, calculated for a ground-based cosmic ray detectors network. Analysis of the obtained results showed that the approximation was performed with high accuracy, and the results are suitable for use in latitude measurements during marine expeditions.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: Detection of a nearby world orbiting in the habitable zone of Gl725B achieved by correcting strong telluric contamination in near-infrared radial velocities with WAPITI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are prime targets in the search for exoplanets because of their prevalence and because low-mass planets can be better detected with radial velocity (RV) methods. In particular, the near-infrared (NIR) spectral domain offers an increased RV sensitivity and potentially reduced stellar activity signals. Howevern precise NIR RV measurements can be strongly affected by telluric absorption lines from the Earth's atmosphere.
  We searched for planets orbiting Gl 725 B, a nearby late-M dwarf at $3.5$ pc, using high-precision SPIRou RV observations. We assessed the impact of telluric contamination and evaluated the performance of the weighted principal component analysis reconstruction method (WAPITI), designed to mitigate these systematics and improve planet detectability.
  Using synthetic and observational SPIRou data, we simulated telluric effects on RVs under varying barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) conditions and applied WAPITI to correct line-by-line RVs. The method was tested through injection-recovery experiments and applied to real SPIRou observations of Gl 725 B.
  WAPITI efficiently corrects telluric contamination in simulated and real datasets, enhancing the detectability and accuracy of planetary signals. We identify a two-planet system around Gl 725 B composed of a candidate inner planet (Gl 725 Bb) with a period of $4.765 \pm 0.004$ days and semi-amplitude $1.4 \pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$, and a confirmed outer planet (Gl 725 Bc) with a period of $37.90 \pm 0.17$ days and semi-amplitude $1.7 \pm 0.3$ m.s$^{-1}$. Their minimum masses are $1.5 \pm 0.4$ and $3.5 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$, respectively, and the outer planet lies in the habitable zone. Using a multi-dimensional Gaussian process framework to model stellar activity, we also recover a stellar rotation period of $105.1 \pm 3.3$ days.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).</description>

      <title>Millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy of methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and somewhat larger cyano derivatives were detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 recently. Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \le 61$ and $K_a \le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>High-bandwidth frequency domain multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensors for neutrinoless double beta decay searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next-generation of cryogenic neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments require increasingly fast readout in order to improve background discrimination. These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\sim$100 $\mu$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz. We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor. Each multiplexing readout module comprises ten superconducting resonators in the MHz range and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), interfaced to high-bandwidth field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronics for digital signal processing and low-latency feedback.</description>

      <title>Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured $z$-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS in closed loop. This approach obviates the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. Our laboratory experiments validate tip/tilt estimation and correction using nlCWFS data, achieving tip/tilt accuracy of +/-0.1, lambda/D for an unaberrated beam and better than ~+/-0.5, lambda/D in the presence of aberrations, consistent with prior numerical simulations. We further demonstrate a closed-loop tip/tilt control implementation and show a qualitative improvement in the stability and overall quality of multi-plane phase retrieval reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshifts in JWST Deep Fields: A Pixel-Based Alternative with DeepDISC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.</description>

      <title>PHECT: A lightweight computation tool for pulsar halo emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, most likely formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as standard diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond standard diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous diffusion coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter with magnetic resonance force microscopy</title>

Abstract: We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) search for axion dark matter around 1 GHz. The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ 2.0: Vetting TESS Full-Frame Image Transit Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</description>
