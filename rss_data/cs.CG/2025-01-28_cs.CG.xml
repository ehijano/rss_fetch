      <title>Piecewise Ruled Approximation for Freeform Mesh Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ruled surface is a shape swept out by moving a line in 3D space. Due to their simple geometric forms, ruled surfaces have applications in various domains such as architecture and engineering. However, existing methods that use ruled surfaces to approximate a target shape mainly focus on surfaces of non-positive Gaussian curvature. In this paper, we propose a method to compute a piecewise ruled surface that approximates an arbitrary freeform surface. Given the input shape represented as a triangle mesh, we propose a group-sparsity formulation to optimize the mesh shape into an approximately piecewise ruled form, in conjugation with a tangent vector field that indicates the ruling directions. Afterward, we use the optimization result to extract the patch topology and construct the initial rulings. Finally, we further optimize the positions and orientations of the rulings to improve the alignment with the input target shape. We apply our method to a variety of freeform shapes with different topologies and complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness in approximating arbitrary shapes.</description>

      <title>On winding numbers of almost embeddings of $K_4$ in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $K_4$ to the plane such that $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. For any vertex $v \in K_4$ take the winding number of the $f$-image of the cycle $K_4 - v$ around $f(v)$. It is known that the sum of these four integers is odd. We construct examples showing that this is the only relation between these four numbers.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. Although the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we go further by establishing a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. In particular, we show that M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion, as its Euler characteristic coincides with the M\"obius inversion applied to the dimension function of the representation. We also present a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, relating the M\"obius homologies of two posets connected by a Galois connection.
  Our main application concerns persistent homology over general posets. We prove that, under a suitable definition, the persistence diagram arises as an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals, and thus M\"obius homology provides a categorification of the persistence diagram. This furnishes a new invariant for persistent homology over arbitrary finite posets. Finally, leveraging our homological variant of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, we establish several results about the persistence diagram.</description>

      <title>Mean of Means: A 10-dollar Solution for Human Localization with Calibration-free and Unconstrained Camera Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially in the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 95% within a 0.3m range and nearly 100% accuracy within a 0.5m range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.</description>

      <title>Is magnitude 'generically continuous' for finite metric spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces which, in the finite setting, can be understood as recording the 'effective number of points' in a space as the scale of the metric varies. Motivated by applications in topological data analysis, this paper investigates the stability of magnitude: its continuity properties with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We show that magnitude is nowhere continuous on the Gromov-Hausdorff space of finite metric spaces. Yet, we find evidence to suggest that it may be 'generically continuous', in the sense that generic Gromov-Hausdorff limits are preserved by magnitude. We make the case that, in fact, 'generic stability' is what matters for applicability.</description>

      <title>Covering half-grids with lines and planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study hyperplane covering problems for finite grid-like structures in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We call a set $\mathcal{C}$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a conical grid if the line $y = a_i$ intersects $\mathcal{C}$ in exactly $i$ points, for some $a_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; a_n \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the number of lines required to cover every point of such a grid at least $k$ times is at least $nk\left(1-\frac{1}{e}-O(\frac{1}{n}) \right)$. If the grid $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained by cutting an $m \times n$ grid of points into a half along one of the diagonals, then we prove the lower bound of $mk\left(1-e^{-\frac{n}{m}}-O(\frac{n}{m^2})\right)$.
  Motivated by the Alon-F\"uredi theorem on hyperplane coverings of grids that miss a point and its multiplicity variations, we study the problem of finding the minimum number of hyperplanes required to cover every point of an $n \times \cdots \times n$ half-grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at least $k$ times while missing a point $P$. For almost all such half-grids, with $P$ being the corner point, we prove asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds for the covering number in dimensions $2$ and $3$. For $k = 1$, $d = 2$, and an arbitrary $P$, we determine this number exactly by using the polynomial method bound for grids.</description>
