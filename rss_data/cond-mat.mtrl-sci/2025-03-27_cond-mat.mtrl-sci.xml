      <title>Multiferroic nematic d-wave altermagnetism driven by orbital-order on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide promising platforms for unconventional magnetism, whose controllability would enable a whole new generation of spintronic devices. While a variety of bulk altermagnets have been discovered, altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that the strained honeycomb monolayer VCl$_{3}$ is an orbital-order-driven ferroelectric altermagnet, exhibiting a significant and switchable spin-splitting. By using low-energy Hamiltonian and first-principles methods in combination with symmetry analysis, we reveal a unique anti-ferro-orbital-antiferromagnetic phase characterized by a 2D nematic $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting, tightly coupled with an orbital-ordered induced ferroelectric polarization. Finally, through symmetry mode analysis, we investigate how structural distortions favor the intricate interplay between orbital, altermagnetic, and ferroelectric degrees of freedom. Our study identifies VCl$_3$ as a prototypical 2D orbital-order-driven multiferroic altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice, establishing a van der Waals monolayer featuring altermagnetic ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>

      <title>Downsizing Machine Learning Models by Optimization through Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a technique to enhance the efficiency of quadratic machine learning models, particularly Field-Aware Factorization Machines (FFMs) handling binary data. Our approach strategically reduces model size through optimized feature selection based on the Ising model, maintaining comparable accuracy to the original model. By exploiting the adjustability of FFM's cross-term weights during a novel two-stage training process, we demonstrate a significant improvement in overall computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Large asymmetric anomalous Nernst effect in the antiferromagnet SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large anomalous Nernst effect is essential for thermoelectric energy harvesting in the transverse geometry without external magnetic field. It is often connected with anomalous Hall effect, especially when electronic Berry curvature is believed to be the driving force. This approach implicitly assumes the same symmetry for the Nernst and Hall coefficients, which is however not necessarily true. Here we report a large anomalous Nernst effect in antiferromagnetic SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$ that defies the antisymmetric constraint on the anomalous Hall effect imposed by the Onsager reciprocal relation. The observed spontaneous Nernst thermopower quickly reaches the sub-$\mu$V/K level below the N\'eel transition around 250 K, which is comparable with many topological antiferromagnetic semimetals and far excels other magnetic oxides. Our analysis indicates that the coexistence of significant symmetric and antisymmetric contributions plays a key role, pointing to the importance of extracting both contributions and a new pathway to enhanced anomalous Nernst effect for transverse thermoelectrics</description>

      <title>Acceleration of shell DFT-1/2 in high-throughput calculations via cutoff radii prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell DFT-1/2 is a fast band gap rectification method that is versatile for semiconductor supercell and superlattice calculations, which involves two cutoff radii that have to be optimized. Although such optimization is trivial in terms of time cost for a primitive cell, in high-throughput calculations this can be a big concern because most materials are themselves in small unit cells. The numerous optimization trials increase the computational cost to orders of magnitudes higher. In this work, we construct a regression model for the prediction of the two cutoff radii based on chemical composition and primitive cell structure. Moreover, a model for metal and insulator classification is also given, with 95.2% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric Transition in a Nonpyroelectric Gyroidal Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the thirty-two crystallographic point groups, 432 is the only one that lacks an inversion center but does not exhibit piezoelectricity. A gyroidal structure belongs to point group 432 and shows characteristic physical properties attributed to its distinctive strong isotropic network. Here, we investigate a gyroidal cobalt oxalate metal-organic framework (MOF) with disordered orientations of SO4 tetrahedra. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments using a single crystal reveal a cubic-to-cubic structural phase transition at TS = 120 K. This transition involves a change in the point group from nonpiezoelectric 432 to piezoelectric 23. The symmetry change arises from the ordering of distorted SO4 molecules, leading to a three-dimensional helical arrangement of electric dipole moments. Furthermore, pyroelectric current measurements using polycrystalline pellet samples reveal that electric polarization emerges below TS depending on the magnitude of the pelletizing pressure, demonstrating piezoelectricity. The gyroidal MOF offers an opportunity to explore unique dielectric properties induced by the helical ordering of molecules and structural flexibility.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin-charge interconversion in topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics. Nonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic heterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of topological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two "reciprocal" effects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on spin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and charge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers experimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping techniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion efficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py. Using a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely inequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current leakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies previous conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and highlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin transport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Structural and transport properties of LiTFSI/G3 electrolyte with machine-learned molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azanide-triglyme electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries. However, its solvation structure and transport properties at the atomic scale remain incompletely understood. In this study, we develop an efficient and accurate neuroevolution potential (NEP) model by integrating bootstrap and active learning strategies. Using machine-learned NEP-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structural and diffusion properties of LiTFSI/G3 across a wide range of the solute-to-solvent ratios, systematically analyzing electrolyte density, ion coordination, viscosity, and lithium self-diffusion. The computed densities show excellent agreement with experimental data, and pair correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between lithium ions and surrounding oxygen atoms, which strongly impacts Li$^+$ mobility. Viscosity and diffusion calculations further demonstrate that increasing LiTFSI concentration enhances Li-O interactions, resulting in higher viscosity and reduced lithium diffusion. Additionally, machine learning-based path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations confirm the negligible impact of quantum effects on Li$^+$ transport. The electrolyte-specific protocol developed in this work provides a systematic framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning potentials for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of Cr2Te3 revisited by ac magnetostrictive coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential applications in spintronics and fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetism. Cr2Te3, a quasi 2D non van der Waals magnet, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram due to competing magnetic interactions within and between layers. However, the precise nature and evolution of these magnetic phases remain unclear. Here, we utilize an ultrahigh-sensitive composite magnetoelectric technique, which probes the ac magnetostrictive coefficient, to systematically explore the temperature magnetic field phase diagram of Cr2Te3 single crystals. Our results reveal the coexistence of multiple magnetic phases, including canted ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic states. Another canted ferromagnetic phase and a possible triple point have been proposed. The updated phase diagram provides deeper insights into the specific spin configurations associated with each phase. These findings also highlight the decoupled magnetic ordering between the Cr1/Cr3 layers and the Cr2 layer near the magnetic ordering temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergent properties and the multiscale characterization challenge in condensed matter, from crystals to complex materials: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of condensed matter arises from emergent behaviors that cannot be understood by analyzing individual constituents in isolation. While traditional condensed-matter approaches-developed primarily for ideal crystalline solids-have provided deep insights into symmetry, order, and electronic structure, they fall short in describing the rich, multiscale organization of hierarchical and soft materials. These systems exhibit structural correlations across multiple length and time scales, often governed by nonlinear interactions that span from molecular to macroscopic domains. This review explores how the convergence of emerging experimental and computational strategies are redefining our ability to characterize and model such systems. We examine how multimodal techniques-combining scattering, imaging, and spectroscopy-can map structural order and dynamics across scales, with methods like small-angle scattering tensor tomography, dark-field imaging, and ultrafast spectroscopies providing unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. On the computational front, machine learning approaches such as graph neural networks, neural operators, and physics-informed models offer powerful tools to connect disparate scales and uncover hidden correlations in high-dimensional data. These advancements have the potential to close the gap between structure and function in complex materials, thereby addressing one of the grand challenges of contemporary material science: understanding and engineering multiscale architectures, whose emergent properties underpin the behavior of next-generation functional materials, biological systems, and adaptive technologies.</description>

      <title>Mathematical crystal chemistry II: Random search for ionic crystals and analysis on oxide crystals registered in ICSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions to mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tetrapartite and bipartite quantum entanglement in octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ under an external magnetic field using exact diagonalization. These molecular magnets that can be effectively characterized by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two Ni$^\text{2+}_2$Gd$_2^\text{3+}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. We detect that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, reflecting distinct ground states characteristic of Gd-containing compounds. Using negativity as a quantum entanglement measure, we analyze the effects of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite and bipartite entanglements in two families of Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong tetrapartite entanglement, persisting up to $T \approx 2.5$ K and $B \approx 4.0$ T, but considerably weak bipartite entanglement between Ni$\cdots$Ni and Ni$\cdots$Gd links. Conversely, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ shows strong bipartite entanglements but negligible tetrapartite entanglement negativity. These findings highlight the critical role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping entanglement properties in heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes.</description>

      <title>Coupled electromigration-nanoindentation study on dislocation nucleation in SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern functional oxides are mainly engineered by doping, essentially by tuning the defect chemistry. Recent studies suggest that dislocations offer a new perspective for enhancing the mechanical and physical properties of ceramic oxides. This raises the question regarding the interaction between dislocations and point defects in ceramics. Here, we report the impact of defect chemistry on the mechanical response of single-crystal strontium titanate, a prototype perovskite oxide. We demonstrate that electric field-induced stoichiometry polarization alters the defect chemistry, primarily by tuning oxygen vacancies, resulting in a distinct difference in the maximum shear stresses for dislocation nucleation, as experimentally observed and corroborated by molecular dynamic simulation. The impact of indenter tip size and geometry on the dislocation nucleation behavior in samples with different point defect concentrations in ceramics is further elucidated. Similar to the electromigration findings, acceptor-doped SrTiO3 tends to promote dislocation nucleation due to the abundance of oxygen vacancies. These findings shed new light on the interaction between dislocations and point defects in oxides. They may pave the road for assessing the stability of the next-generation functional ceramics engineered by dislocations.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale, Long-Time Atomistic Simulations of Proton Transport in Polymer Electrolyte Membranes Using a Neural Network Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have attracted significant attention as a method that enables large-scale, long-time atomistic simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio wavefunction theories. However, a challenge with MLIP-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is their lower stability compared to those using conventional classical potentials. Analyzing highly heterogeneous systems or amorphous materials often requires large-scale and long-time simulations, necessitating the development of robust MLIPs that allow for stable MD simulations. In this study, using our neural network potential (NNP) generator, we construct an NNP model that enables large-scale, long-time MD simulations of perfluorinated ionomer membranes (Nafion) across a wide range of hydration levels. We successfully build a robust deep potential (DP) model by iteratively expanding the dataset through active-learning loops. Specifically, by combining the sampling of off-equilibrium structures via non-equilibrium DPMD simulations with the structure screening in a 3D structural feature space incorporating minimum interatomic distances, it is possible to significantly enhance the robustness of the DP model, which allows for stable MD simulations of large Nafion systems ranging from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 atoms for an extended duration of 31 ns. The MD simulations employing the developed DP model yield self-diffusion coefficients of hydrogen atoms that more closely match experimental values in a wide range of hydration levels compared to previous ab initio MD simulations of smaller systems.</description>

      <title>Switching on Antiferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics attract broad attention due to their unusual physical characteristics, chief among which is the double-hysteresis loop that separates their antipolar ground state from the voltage-induced polar phase, which is promising for applications in energy storage and electrocaloric cooling. However, their defining features (antipolar ground state and double-hysteresis loops) are increasingly challenged: materials with non-collinear and/or hybrid polar-antipolar order have been discovered, and double-hysteresis has been realized in materials without a conventional antipolar ground state. These developments add to the intensifying interest in fundamental and practical aspects of antiferroelectrics, and call for a fresh look at antiferroelectricity. In this Perspective, we provide an updated and all-encompassing definition of antiferroelectricity, discuss material systems with new antipolar orders and/or engineered double hysteresis, and reflect on emergent properties and theoretical approaches. This work casts a bird's eye view on the rapidly evolving trends that are shaping up the research on ferroics with antipolar order.</description>

      <title>Are there type-III multiferroics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroics are known to be classified into two types. However, type-I lacks sufficient magnetoelectric coupling and type-II lacks sufficient electric polarization, making both practically difficult. In this work, we explore the possibility of type-III multiferroics, where the origins of ferroelectricity and magnetism are highly intertwined but not causally related, with a combination of strong magnetoelectric coupling and large polarization. Our first-principles calculations predict that monolayer TiCdO$_{4}$ is such a type-III ferroelectric-ferromagnetic multiferroics with both electronic and magnetic orders originating from competing electron populations on oxygen atoms. It shows an electric polarization of 50 $\mu$C/m$^{2}$ while the maximum linear and quadratic magnetoelectric response are as high as 35000 ps/m and 1.59 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ s/A, respectively. Our study opens up new perspectives for the discovery and design of much-anticipated multiferroics that can be used for cross-modulation.</description>

      <title>When invariants matter: The role of I1 and I2 in neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the formulation of machine learning-based material models, the usage of invariants of deformation tensors is attractive, since this can a priori guarantee objectivity and material symmetry. In this work, we consider incompressible, isotropic hyperelasticity, where two invariants I1 and I2 are required for depicting a deformation state. First, we aim at enhancing the understanding of the invariants. We provide an explicit representation of the set of invariants that are admissible, i.e. for which (I1, I2) a deformation state does indeed exist. Furthermore, we prove that uniaxial and equi-biaxial deformation correspond to the boundary of the set of admissible invariants. Second, we study how the experimentally-observed behaviour of different materials can be captured by means of neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity, depending on whether both I1 and I2 or solely one of the invariants, i.e. either only I1 or only I2, are taken into account. To this end, we investigate three different experimental data sets from the literature. In particular, we demonstrate that considering only one invariant, either I1 or I2, can allow for good agreement with experiments in case of small deformations. In contrast, it is necessary to consider both invariants for precise models at large strains, for instance when rubbery polymers are deformed. Moreover, we show that multiaxial experiments are strictly required for the parameterisation of models considering I2. Otherwise, if only data from uniaxial deformation is available, significantly overly stiff responses could be predicted for general deformation states. On the contrary, I1-only models can make qualitatively correct predictions for multiaxial loadings even if parameterised only from uniaxial data, whereas I2-only models are completely incapable in even qualitatively capturing experimental stress data at large deformations.</description>

      <title>The Fermi surface of RuO2 measured by quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ had emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this orthodoxy. In particular, surface-sensitive probes have detected unusual surface states that may exhibit several characteristics expected for an altermagnet, challenging the determination of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of the bulk. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with heavy effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass, indicative of strong electronic correlations. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place strong constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>A systematic approach for quantitative orientation and phase fraction analysis of thin films through grazing incidence X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is widely used for the structural characterization of thin films, particularly for analyzing phase composition and the orientation distribution of crystallites. While various tools exist for qualitative evaluation, a widely applicable systematic procedure to achieve quantitative information has not yet been developed. This work presents a first step in that direction, allowing accurate quantitative information to be achieved through the evaluation of radial line profiles from GIXD data. An algorithm is introduced for computing radial line profiles based on the crystal structure of known compounds. By fitting experimental data with calculated line profiles, accurate quantitative information about orientation distribution and phase composition is obtained, along with additional parameters such as mosaicity and total crystal volume. The approach is demonstrated using three distinct thin film systems, highlighting the broad applicability of the algorithm. This method provides a systematic and general approach to obtaining quantitative information from GIXD data.</description>

      <title>Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving high crystalline quality films with controlled properties on low cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity of multilayer films and leads to the record film conductivity of 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the film on its electrical conductivity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the commonly used Eg Raman peak width, but also the A1g peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with thinner Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher conductivity. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength: photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Controlling magnetic damping with spintronic thermal effects in Py/Fe3O4-PANI bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experiments that control magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI via two spintronic thermal effects: spin Seebeck and anomalous Nernst. Magnetic damping is measured using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques, where the sample is excited by microwave radiation and the resulting DC voltage is detected in the Fe3O4-PANI film. When a temperature gradient is applied in the longitudinal configuration, the DC voltage linewidth increases or decreases depending on the direction of the thermal gradient. This finding demonstrates that magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI can be controlled by currents induced by thermal effects. Remarkably, the absolute linewidth changes observed in Py/Fe3O4-PANI exceed those seen in bilayers of ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet and heavy metal by more than an order of magnitude. We interpret the significant change in magnetic damping as a result of intrinsic phenomena occurring in bilayers.</description>

      <title>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Developing a Complete AI-Accelerated Workflow for Superconductor Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of materials discovery has continually transformed, progressing from empirical experimentation to virtual high-throughput screening, which leverages computational techniques to fully characterize a material before synthesis. Despite the successes of these approaches, significant bottlenecks remain due to the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required to determine the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of a material and its functional properties. In particular, discovering new superconductors is massively impeded by the cost of computing the electron-phonon spectral functions, which limits the feasible materials space. Recent advances in machine learning offer an opportunity to accelerate the superconductor discovery workflow by developing machine-learning-based surrogates for DFT. Here we present a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (BEE-NET), a ML model that predicts the Eliashberg spectral function achieves a test mean absolute error of 0.87 K for the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), relative to predictions of the Allen-Dynes equation using DFT-derived spectral functions. BEE-NET simultaneously identifies candidate structures with $T_c &gt; 5$ K at a precision of 86% and a true negative rate of 99.4%. Combined with elemental substitution and ML interatomic potentials, this models puts us in position to develop a complete AI-accelerated workflow to identify novel superconductors. The workflow achieved 87% precision, narrowing 1.3 million candidates to 741 stable compounds with DFT-confirmed $T_c &gt; 5$ K. We report the prediction and successful experimental synthesis, characterization, and verification of two novel superconductors. This work exemplifies the potential of integrating machine learning, computational methods, and experimental techniques to revolutionize the field of materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spatial Control of Charge Doping in n-Type Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially controlling the Fermi level of topological insulators and keeping its electronic states stable are indispensable processes to put this material into practical use for semiconductor spintronics devices. So far, however, such a method has not been established yet. Here we show a novel method for doping hole into n-type topological insulators Bi$_2$X$_3$ (X= Se, Te) that overcomes the shortcomings of the previous reported methods. The key of this doping is to adsorb H$_2$O on Bi$_2$X$_3$ decorated with a small amount of carbon, and its trigger is the irradiation of photon with sufficient energy to excite core-electrons of the outermost layer atoms. This method allows controlling the doping amount by the irradiation time, and acts as photolithography. Such a tunable doping makes it possible to design the electronic states at the nanometer scale, and thus paves a promising avenue toward the realization of novel spintronics devices based on topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: The room temperature X-ray photoemission spectrum of the ferromagnetic compound UCu$_2$Si$_2$ (T$_C$ = 100 K) was measured using an Al K$_{\alpha}$ source. Related theoretical spectra were computed from densities of electronic states obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and using the GGA+U method. The calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental one. The spin polarized calculations based on the GGA+U approach as well as GGA/LSDA with orbital polarization (OP) corrections taken into account provide values of the total magnetic moment in reasonable agreement with the experimental values ranging between 1.6 and 2.0 $\mu_B$/U atom.</description>

      <title>An Efficient scaled opposite-spin MP2 method for periodic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop SOS-RILT-MP2, an efficient Gaussian-based periodic scaled opposite-spin second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (SOS-MP2) algorithm that utilizes the resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) combined with the Laplace transform technique (LT). In our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 174112 (2022)], we showed that SOS-MP2 yields better predictions of the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of 12 simple semiconductors and insulators compared to conventional MP2 and some of the leading density functionals. In this work, we present an efficient SOS-MP2 algorithm that has a scaling of O(N4) with the number of atoms N in the unit cell and a reduced scaling with the number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We implemented and tested our algorithm on both molecular and solid-state systems, confirming the predicted scaling behavior by systematically increasing the number of atoms, the size of the basis set, and the density of k-point sampling. Using the benzene molecular crystal as a case study, we demonstrated that SOS-RILT-MP2 achieves significantly improved efficiency compared to conventional MP2.

      <title>Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Correlated proton disorder in the crystal structure of the double hydroxide perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuSn(OH)$_6$ is a quantum spin system from the family of magnetic double perovskite hydroxides, having a frustrated magnetic sublattice. It is also known as the natural mineral mushistonite, whose crystal structure has remained elusive for decades. Here we employ x-ray and neutron powder diffraction to solve the crystal structure of CuSn(OH)$_6$ and propose a structure model in the orthorhombic space group $Pnnn$ with correlated proton disorder. The occupation of the hydrogen sites in the structure is constrained by ``ice rules'' similar to those known for water ice. The resulting frustration of the hydrogen bonding network is likely to have a complex and interesting interplay with the strong magnetic frustration expected in the face-centred magnetic sublattice. Structural distortions, which are quite pronounced in Cu$^{2+}$ compounds due to the Jahn-Teller effect, partially alleviate both types of frustration. We also show that hydrostatic pressure tends to suppress proton disorder through a sequence of proton-ordering transitions, as some of the split hydrogen sites merge already at 1.75 GPa while others show a tendency toward possible merging at higher pressures.</description>

      <title>Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of BCZT from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.</description>

      <title>BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond 5 GHz excitation of a ZnO-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator on SiC substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reports on the fabrication and characterization of an Au/ZnO/Pt-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR) on SiC substrates. We evaluate its microwave characteristics comparing with Si substrates for micro-electromechanical applications. Dielectric magnetron sputtering and an electron beam evaporator are employed to develop highly c-axis-oriented ZnO films and metal electrodes. The crystal structure and surface morphology of post-growth layers have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. HBAR on SiC substrate results in multiple longitudinal bulk acoustic wave resonances up to 7 GHz, with the strongest excited resonances emerging at 5.25 GHz. The value of f.Q (Resonance frequency * Quality factor) parameter obtained using a novel Q approach method for HBAR on SiC substrate is 4.1 * 10^13 Hz, which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest among all reported values for specified ZnO-based devices.</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast photoinduced phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through ultrafast optical excitation. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, discovering distinct fluence-dependent responses in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, and revealing a possible magnetic order-driven transition between different topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, possibly offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for the real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.</description>

      <title>Isotopic separation in mixed clusters of molecular hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate mixed (50/50) clusters of parahydrogen and orthodeuterium at low temperature, by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~ 6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.</description>
