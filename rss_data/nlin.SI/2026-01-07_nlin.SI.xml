      <title>Multiple double-valley and single-valley dark solitons in the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation: shape-preserving collisions and shape-altering collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape-preserving and shape-altering collisions of dark solitons are investigated in the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction.</description>

      <title>Exactly solved model of a one dimensional self gravitating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model one-dimensional self consistent steady state collisionless self-gravitating system in which all the particles have the same energy is presented. This has the remarkable property that the position and velocity of the particles orbiting in their own self consistent potential are given exactly, in terms of time, by the truncations of sine and cosine functions to the first two terms in their respective Taylor series. The potential and density also have simple analytic expressions in terms of time as parameter. It is not being claimed that this system has any direct astronomical application. However, it does motivate a conjecture about the behaviour of the density, potential, and orbits near caustics in simulations of cold collisionless dark matter. It is a rather surprising result which might interest practitioners of stellar dynamics and serve as an elementary example in teaching the subject.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetric branched optical lattices: Spectral properties and stability of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate branched PT-symmetric optical lattices. We consider both the linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a PT-symmetric periodic potential on the graph and solve them by imposing weighted vertex boundary conditions. A constraint derived from these vertex conditions determines the exceptional point of the system. In the PT unbroken phase, this constraint enforces PT-symmetric boundary conditions at the vertices, ensuring a purely real spectrum; its violation leads to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in the linear regime. In the nonlinear regime, the same constraint determines the linear stability of solitons: satisfying the constraint yields stable solitons, whereas violating it corresponds to unstable solitons.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems on multiplicative quiver varieties from cyclic quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of complex manifolds constructed as multiplicative quiver varieties associated with a cyclic quiver extended by an arbitrary number of arrows starting at a new vertex. Such varieties admit a Poisson structure, which is obtained by quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. We construct several families of Poisson subalgebras inside the coordinate ring of these spaces, which we use to obtain degenerately integrable systems. We also extend the Poisson centre of these algebras to maximal abelian Poisson algebras, hence defining Liouville integrable systems. By considering a suitable set of local coordinates on the multiplicative quiver varieties, we can derive the local Poisson structure explicitly. This allows us to interpret the integrable systems that we have constructed as new generalisations of the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider system with several types of spin variables.</description>

      <title>A new super integrable hierarchy and a generalized super-AKNS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-isospectral problem on the loop algebra of the Lie superalgebra osp(1,6), and construct an super integrable system using the supertrace identity. The resulting super integrable system can be reduced to the super-AKNS hierarchy under certain conditions. By reconsidering a new (2 + 1)-dimensional non-isospectral problem with spectral matrices satisfying these conditions, we obtain a (2+1)-dimensional generalization of the superAKNS hierarchy.</description>
