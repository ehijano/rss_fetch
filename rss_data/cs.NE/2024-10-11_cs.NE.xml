      <title>Comprehensive Online Training and Deployment for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. In the current supervised learning domain of SNNs, compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion and has received widespread academic attention. However, the current proposed online training methods cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Efficient Multi-Precision Firing (EM-PF) model, which is a family of advanced spiking models based on floating-point spikes and binary synaptic weights. We point out that EM-PF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and achieve full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that EM-PF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques including random back-propagation, parallel computation and channel attention mechanism, to achieve state-of-the-art performance with extremely low computational overhead in the field of online learning.</description>

      <title>Octopus Inspired Optimization Algorithm: Multi-Level Structures and Parallel Computing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel bionic intelligent optimisation algorithm, Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO) algorithm, which is inspired by the neural structure of octopus, especially its hierarchical and decentralised interaction properties. By simulating the sensory, decision-making, and executive abilities of octopuses, the OIO algorithm adopts a multi-level hierarchical strategy, including tentacles, suckers, individuals and groups, to achieve an effective combination of global and local search. This hierarchical design not only enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the algorithm, but also significantly improves its search efficiency and adaptability. In performance evaluations, including comparisons with existing mainstream intelligent optimisation algorithms, OIO shows faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially when dealing with multimodal functions and high-dimensional optimisation problems. This advantage is even more pronounced as the required minimum accuracy is higher, with the OIO algorithm showing an average speedup of 2.27 times that of conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and 9.63 times that of differential evolution (DE) on multimodal functions. In particular, when dealing with high-dimensional optimisation problems, OIO achieves an average speed of 10.39 times that of DE, demonstrating its superior computational efficiency. In addition, the OIO algorithm also shows a reduction of about $5\%$ in CPU usage efficiency compared to PSO, which is reflected in the efficiency of CPU resource usage also shows its efficiency. These features make the OIO algorithm show great potential in complex optimisation problems, and it is especially suitable for application scenarios that require fast, efficient and robust optimisation methods, such as robot path planning, supply chain management optimisation, and energy system management.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator based Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical optimization techniques are widely used in a broad area of science and technology, from finding the minimal energy of systems in Physics or Chemistry to finding optimal routes in logistics or optimal strategies for high speed trading. In general, a set of parameters (parameter space) is tuned to find the lowest value of a function depending on these parameters (cost function). In most cases the parameter space is too big to be completely searched and the most efficient techniques combine stochastic elements (randomness included in the starting setting and decision making during the optimization process) with well designed deterministic process. Thus there is nothing like a universal best optimization method; rather than that, different methods and their settings are more or less efficient in different contexts. Here we present a method that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a highly effective and successful algorithm inspired by the collective behavior of a flock of birds searching for food, with the principles of Harmonic Oscillators. This physics-based approach introduces the concept of energy, enabling a smoother and a more controlled convergence throughout the optimization process. We test our method on a standard set of test functions and show that in most cases it can outperform its natural competitors including the original PSO as well as the broadly used COBYLA and Differential Evolution optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of gender bias in automatic facial non-verbal behaviors generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on non-verbal behavior generation for social interactive agents focuses mainly on the believability and synchronization of non-verbal cues with speech. However, existing models, predominantly based on deep learning architectures, often perpetuate biases inherent in the training data. This raises ethical concerns, depending on the intended application of these agents. This paper addresses these issues by first examining the influence of gender on facial non-verbal behaviors. We concentrate on gaze, head movements, and facial expressions. We introduce a classifier capable of discerning the gender of a speaker from their non-verbal cues. This classifier achieves high accuracy on both real behavior data, extracted using state-of-the-art tools, and synthetic data, generated from a model developed in previous work.Building upon this work, we present a new model, FairGenderGen, which integrates a gender discriminator and a gradient reversal layer into our previous behavior generation model. This new model generates facial non-verbal behaviors from speech features, mitigating gender sensitivity in the generated behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier, developed in the initial phase, is no longer effective in distinguishing the gender of the speaker from the generated non-verbal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Web Attack Detection: An Uncertainty-Aware Ensemble Deep Kernel Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web attacks are one of the major and most persistent forms of cyber threats, which bring huge costs and losses to web application-based businesses. Various detection methods, such as signature-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based, have been proposed to identify web attacks. However, these methods either (1) heavily rely on accurate and complete rule design and feature engineering, which may not adapt to fast-evolving attacks, or (2) fail to estimate model uncertainty, which is essential to the trustworthiness of the prediction made by the model. In this study, we proposed an Uncertainty-aware Ensemble Deep Kernel Learning (UEDKL) model to detect web attacks from HTTP request payload data with the model uncertainty captured from the perspective of both data distribution and model parameters. The proposed UEDKL utilizes a deep kernel learning model to distinguish normal HTTP requests from different types of web attacks with model uncertainty estimated from data distribution perspective. Multiple deep kernel learning models were trained as base learners to capture the model uncertainty from model parameters perspective. An attention-based ensemble learning approach was designed to effectively integrate base learners' predictions and model uncertainty. We also proposed a new metric named High Uncertainty Ratio-F Score Curve to evaluate model uncertainty estimation. Experiments on BDCI and SRBH datasets demonstrated that the proposed UEDKL framework yields significant improvement in both web attack detection performance and uncertainty estimation quality compared to benchmark models.</description>

      <title>SNN-PAR: Energy Efficient Pedestrian Attribute Recognition via Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural network based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) has been widely studied in recent years, despite many progresses, however, the energy consumption is still high. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based framework for energy-efficient attribute recognition. Specifically, we first adopt a spiking tokenizer module to transform the given pedestrian image into spiking feature representations. Then, the output will be fed into the spiking Transformer backbone networks for energy-efficient feature extraction. We feed the enhanced spiking features into a set of feed-forward networks for pedestrian attribute recognition. In addition to the widely used binary cross-entropy loss function, we also exploit knowledge distillation from the artificial neural network to the spiking Transformer network for more accurate attribute recognition. Extensive experiments on three widely used PAR benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed SNN-PAR framework.

      <title>Generalization Bounds and Model Complexity for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of the quantum nature of a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Optimization with k-Cluster Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm and Postprocessing Methods for Identification and Quantification of Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal optimization is often encountered in engineering problems, especially when different and alternative solutions are sought. Evolutionary algorithms can efficiently tackle multimodal optimization thanks to their features such as the concept of population, exploration/exploitation, and being suitable for parallel computation. This paper investigates whether a less-known optimizer, the Big Bang-Big Crunch (BBBC) algorithm, is suitable for multimodal optimization. We extended BBBC and propose k-BBBC, a clustering-based multi-modal optimizer. Additionally, we introduce two post-processing methods to (i) identify the local optima in a set of retrieved solutions (i.e., a population), and (ii) quantify the number of correctly retrieved optima against the expected ones (i.e., success rate). Our results show that k-BBBC performs well even with problems having a large number of optima (tested on $379$ optima) and high dimensionality (tested on $32$ decision variables), but it becomes computationally too expensive for problems with many local optima (i.e., in the CEC'2013 benchmark set). Compared to other multimodal optimization methods, it outperforms them in terms of accuracy (in both search and objective space) and success rate (number of correctly retrieved optima) when tested on basic multimodal functions, especially when elitism is applied; however, it requires knowing the number of optima of a problem, which makes its performance decrease when tested on niching competition test CEC'2013. Lastly, we validated our proposed post-processing methods by comparing their success rate to the actual one: results suggest that these methods can be used to evaluate the performance of a multimodal optimization algorithm by correctly identifying optima and providing an indication of success -- without the need to know where the optima are located in the search space.</description>

      <title>Positional Encoding Helps Recurrent Neural Networks Handle a Large Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reports an unintuitive finding that positional encoding enhances learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Positional encoding is a high-dimensional representation of time indices on input data. Most famously, positional encoding complements the capabilities of Transformer neural networks, which lack an inherent mechanism for representing the data order. By contrast, RNNs can encode the temporal information of data points on their own, rendering their use of positional encoding seemingly redundant/unnecessary. Nonetheless, investigations through synthetic benchmarks reveal an advantage of coupling positional encoding and RNNs, especially for handling a large vocabulary that yields low-frequency tokens. Further scrutinization unveils that these low-frequency tokens destabilizes the gradients of vanilla RNNs, and the positional encoding resolves this instability. These results shed a new light on the utility of positional encoding beyond its canonical role as a timekeeper for Transformers.</description>
