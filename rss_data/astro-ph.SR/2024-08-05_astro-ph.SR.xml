      <title>Detection of a new sample of Galactic White Dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) in identifying and characterizing white dwarfs (WDs) within the Milky Way Galaxy. Leveraging the UVIT point source catalogue towards SMC and crossmatching with Gaia DR3 data, we identified 43 single WDs (37 new detections), 13 new WD+main sequence (MS) candidates and 161 UV bright MS stars by analysing their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED). Using the WD evolutionary models, we determine the masses, effective temperatures, and cooling ages of these identified WDs. Masses of these WDs range from 0.2 to 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) between 10000 K to 15000 K, with cooling ages spanning 0.1 to 2 Gyr. Notably, we detect hotter WDs compared to literature values, which is attributed to the sensitivity of UVIT. Furthermore, we report the detection of 20 new extremely low-mass (ELM) candidates from our analysis. Future spectroscopic studies of the ELM candidates will help us understand the formation scenarios of these exotic objects. Despite limitations in Gaia DR3 distance measurements for optically faint WDs, we provide a crude estimate of the WD space density within 1kpc as 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, which is higher than previous estimates in the literature. Our results underscore the instrumental capabilities of UVIT and anticipate the forthcoming UV missions like INSIST for systematic WD discovery. Our methodology sets a precedent for future analyses in other UVIT fields to find more WDs and perform spectroscopic studies to verify their candidacy.</description>

      <title>Two young eclipsing binaries in Orion with temperatures and radii affected by spots and third bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a model of two young eclipsing binaries in the Orion Complex. Both heavily spotted, they present radii and temperatures that are in disagreement with the predictions of standard stellar models. 2M05-06 consists of two stars with different masses (~0.52 and ~0.42 Msun) but with very similar radii (~0.9 Rsun), and with the less massive star having a highly spotted surface that causes it to have a hotter (unspotted) photosphere than the higher-mass star. The other system, 2M05-00, consists of two stars of very similar masses (~0.34 Msun), but very different radii (~0.7 and ~1.0 Rsun), which creates an appearance of the two eclipsing stars being non-coeval. 2M05-00 appears to have a tertiary companion that could offer an explanation for the unusual properties of the eclipsing stars, as has been seen in some other young triple systems. Comparing the empirically measured properties of these eclipsing binaries to the predictions of stellar models, both standard and magnetic, we find that only the magnetic models correctly predict the observed relationship between mass and effective temperature. However, standard (non-magnetic) models better predict the temperatures of the unspotted photospheres. These observations represent an important step in improving our understanding of pre-main-sequence stellar evolution and the roles of spots and tertiaries on fundamental stellar properties.</description>

      <title>Five New Heartbeat Star Systems with Tidally Excited Oscillations Discovered Based on TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories for studying the internal properties of the systems. In this paper, five new HBSs exhibiting TEOs are discovered using TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters are derived using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The TEOs in these objects are examined, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. The pulsation phases of the TEOs in TIC 266809405, TIC 266894805, and TIC 412881444 are consistent with the dominant $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$ spherical harmonic. For TIC 11619404, although the TEO phase is close to the $m=+2$ mode, the $m = 0$ mode cannot be excluded because of the low inclination in this system. The TEO phase in TIC 447927324 shows a large deviation ($&gt;2\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectations, suggesting that it is expected to be a traveling wave rather than a standing wave. In addition, these TEOs occur at relatively low orbital harmonics, and we cautiously suggest that this may be an observational bias. These objects are valuable sources for studying the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and extending the TESS HBS catalog with TEOs.</description>

      <title>Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13049419.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the near-Sun magnetic field of the 10 March 2022 coronal mass ejection observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the near-Sun axial magnetic field of a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 10 March 2022. Solar Orbiter's in situ measurements, 7.8 degrees east of the Sun-Earth line at 0.43 AU, provided a unique vantage point, along with the WIND measurements at 0.99 AU. We determine a single power-law index from near-Sun to L1, including in situ measurements from both vantage points. We tracked the temporal evolution of the instantaneous relative magnetic helicity of the source active region (AR), NOAA AR 12962. By estimating the helicity budget of the pre-and post-eruption AR, we estimated the helicity transported to the CME. Assuming a Lundquist flux-rope model and geometrical parameters obtained through the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) CME forward modelling, we determined the CME axial magnetic field at a GCS-fitted height. Assuming a power-law variation of the axial magnetic field with heliocentric distance, we extrapolated the estimated near-Sun axial magnetic field to in situ measurements at 0.43 AU and 0.99 AU. The net helicity difference between the post-and pre-eruption AR is $(-7.1 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{41} \mathrm{Mx^{2}}$, which is assumed to be bodily transported to the CME. The estimated CME axial magnetic field at a near-Sun heliocentric distance of 0.03 AU is 2067 $\pm$ 405 nT. From 0.03 AU to L1, a single power-law falloff, including both vantage points at 0.43 AU and 0.99 AU, gives an index $-1.23 \pm 0.18$. We observed a significant decrease in the pre-eruptive AR helicity budget. Extending previous studies on inner-heliospheric intervals from 0.3 AU to $\sim$1 AU, referring to estimates from 0.03 AU to measurements at $\sim$1 AU. Our findings indicate a less steep decline in the magnetic field strength with distance compared to previous studies, but they align with studies that include near-Sun in situ magnetic field measurements, such as from Parker Solar Probe.</description>

      <title>Long-period energy releases during a C2.8 flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the intermittent energy-releasing processes by analyzing the long-period pulsations during a C2.8 flare on 2023 June 03. The C2.8 flare shows three successive and repetitive pulsations in soft X-ray (SXR) and high-temperature extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions, which may imply three episodes of energy releases during the solar flare. The QPP period is estimated to be as long as about 7.5 minutes. EUV imaging observations suggest that these three pulsations come from the same flare area dominated by the hot loop system. Conversely, the flare radiation in wavelengths of radio/microwave, low-temperature EUV, ultraviolet (UV), and Ha only reveals the first pulsation, which may be associated with nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection. The other two pulsations in wavelengths of SXR and high-temperature EUV might be caused by the loop-loop interaction. Our observations indicate that the three episodes of energy releases during the C2.8 flare are triggered by different mechanisms, namely the accelerated electron via magnetic reconnection, and the loop-loop interaction in a complicated magnetic configuration.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic survey of faint planetary-nebula nuclei VI. Seventeen hydrogen-rich central stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 17 H-rich central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) observed in our spectroscopic survey of nuclei of faint Galactic PNe carried out at the 10-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Our sample includes ten O(H) stars, four DAO white dwarfs (WDs), two DA WDs, and one sdOB star. The spectra were analyzed by means of NLTE model atmospheres, allowing us to derive the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and He abundances of the central stars. Sixteen of them were analyzed for the first time, increasing the number of hot H-rich central stars with parameters obtained through NLTE atmospheric modeling by approximately 20%. We highlight a rare hot DA WD central star, Abell 24, which has a $T_\mathrm{eff}$ likely in excess of 100kK, as well as the unusually high gravity mass of $0.70 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ for the sdOB star Pa 3, which is significantly higher than the canonical extreme horizontal-branch star mass of $\approx 0.48\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. By investigating Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, which were available for our 15 northern objects, we found none of them show a periodic photometric variability larger than a few hundredths of a magnitude. This could indicate that our sample mainly represents the hottest phase during the canonical evolution of a single star when transitioning from an asymptotic giant branch star into a WD. We also examined the spectral energy distributions, detecting an infrared excess in six of the objects, which could be due to a late-type companion or to hot ($\approx 10^3$ K) and\or cool ($\approx 100$ K) dust. We confirm previous findings that spectroscopic distances are generally higher than found through Gaia astrometry, a discrepancy that deserves to be investigated systematically.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Arrested Circumbinary Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems with comparable masses and a surrounding accretion disk can accrete gas through spiral accretion streams penetrating the central cavity formed by tidal interactions. Using three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigate the possibility of a magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity. Rather than solely continuously feeding the binary through spiral accretion streams, the accretion is regulated by the strong magnetic field inside the cavity. Transport of mass and angular momentum onto the binary then proceeds largely periodically in magnetic flux eruption episodes. The ejected flux tubes carry angular momentum outwards and away from the binary, inject hot plasma into the disk and can launch flares. This likely intermittent scenario could have potential implications for the emission signatures of supermassive black hole binaries, and potentially shed light onto the role magnetic fields play in the binary's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>On the fate of the secondary white dwarf in double-degenerate double-detonation Type Ia supernovae -- II. 3D synthetic observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A leading model for Type Ia supernovae involves the double-detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Double-detonations arise when a surface helium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation; this mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries. Most previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white dwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational consequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in double-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a 1.05$\text{M}_{\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\text{M}_{\odot}$ secondary white dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary remains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the secondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D radiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic observables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar 02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle dependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer spectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates and the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the width-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation models, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation. The secondary detonation has a meaningful impact on all synthetic observables; however, multidimensional nebular phase calculations are needed to support or rule out either model as a likely explanation for Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark energy on the structure of neutron stars: The vacuum case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential role of a cosmic vacuum dark component in the properties of neutron stars is investigated. It is assumed that the static, spherically symmetric distribution of matter within neutron stars is supported by two distinct components: ordinary matter and a vacuum fluid. For normal matter we use a set of state-of-the-art nuclear matter equations of state, each grounded in nuclear physics experiments. The vacuum energy component is inhomogeneously distributed within the star and obeys the standard equation of state ($p_v = -\epsilon_v$). This is characterized by an energy density fraction $y = \epsilon_m/ (\epsilon_m + \epsilon_v)$, which we model as either a constant or radius-dependent. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of vacuum energy significantly affects the mass-radius relationships in neutron stars, influencing both the maximum achievable masses and the qualitative form of these relationships. Some constraints from current multimessenger observational data limiting the amount of vacuum energy within neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We construct a $d$-dimensional Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian (EDQNM) Closure Model to study dynamo action in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we find lower $d_L$ and upper $d_U$ critical dimensions for sustained dynamo action in this incompressible problem. Our model is adaptable for future studies incorporating helicity, compressible effects and a wide range of magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>CXOU J005245.0-722844: Discovery of a Be Star / White Dwarf binary system in the SMC via a very fast, super-Eddington X-ray outburst event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CXOU J005245.0-722844 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that has long been known as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) star, containing an OBe main sequence star and a compact object. In this paper, we report on a new very fast X-ray outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844. X-ray observations taken by Swift constrain the duration of the outburst to less than 16 days and find that the source reached super-Eddington X-ray luminosities during the initial phases of the eruption. The XRT spectrum of CXOU J005245.0-722844 during this outburst reveals a super-soft X-ray source, best fit by an absorbed thermal blackbody model. Optical and Ultraviolet follow-up observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), and Swift identify a brief ~0.5 magnitude optical burst coincident with the X-ray outburst that lasted for less than 7 days. Optical photometry additionally identifies the orbital period of the system to be 17.55 days and identifies a shortening of the period to 17.14 days in the years leading up to the outburst. Optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) confirms that the optical companion is an early-type OBe star. We conclude from our observations that the compact object in this system is a white dwarf (WD), making this the seventh candidate Be/WD X-ray binary. The X-ray outburst is found to be the result of a very-fast, ultra-luminous nova similar to the outburst of MAXI J0158-744.</description>

Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory - Greenland (RNO-G) seeks discovery of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the cosmos through their interactions in ice. The science program extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar observations, as well. Currently seven of 35 planned radio-receiver stations (24 antennas/station) are operational. These stations are sensitive to impulsive radio signals with frequencies between 80 and 700 MHz and feature a neutrino trigger threshold for recording data close to the thermal floor. RNO-G can also trigger on elevated signals from the Sun, resulting in nanosecond resolution time-domain flare data; such temporal resolution is significantly shorter than from most dedicated solar observatories. In addition to possible RNO-G solar flare polarization measurements, the Sun also represents an extremely useful above-surface calibration source.
  Using RNO-G data recorded during the summers of 2022 and 2023, we find signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and also in coincidence with $\sim$2/3 of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite. These observed flares are characterized by significant time-domain impulsivity. Using the known position of the Sun, the flare sample is used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution. We thus establish the Sun as a regularly observed astronomical calibration source to provide the accurate absolute pointing required for neutrino astronomy.</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04026</link>

Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN1a and are possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the suppression of giant planet formation around low-mass stars in clustered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Current exoplanet formation studies tend to overlook the birth environment of stars in clustered environments. The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>

      <title>Effects of Variable Mass, Disk-Like Structure, and Radiation Pressure on the Dynamics of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we intend to investigate the dynamics of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Here we assumed the primaries as the source of radiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like structure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium points in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like structure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear equilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also breaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the quasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points are stable if the mass ratio $\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\mu_c$. It shows that the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.</description>

      <title>SOLES XII. The Aligned Orbit of TOI-2533 b, a Transiting Brown Dwarf Orbiting an F8-type Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00725</link>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs occupy a middle ground in mass space between gaseous giant planets and ultra-cool dwarf stars, and the characterisation of their orbital orientations may shed light on how these neighbouring objects form. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of TOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\pm0.0090$) and wide-separation ($a_b/R_\star = 13.34\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type star, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival photometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown dwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf system with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -7\pm14^{\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the brown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also indicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\pm5.3$ M$_{\rm \tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we find that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in a primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.</description>
