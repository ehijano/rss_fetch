      <title>M5-branes and D4-branes wrapped on disk $\times$ disk and spindle $\ltimes$ disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the $AdS_3\times\text{disk}\times\text{disk}$ and $AdS_2\times\text{disk}\times\text{disk}$ solutions of $U(1)^2$-gauged supergravity in seven and six dimensions, respectively. For the construction of $AdS_3\times\text{disk}\times\text{disk}$ solutions, we employ the previously constructed consistent truncation of seven-dimensional gauged supergravity on a disk. We uplift the solutions to eleven-dimensional and massive type IIA supergravity, respectively, and study the disk geometry of the solutions. We perform flux quantizations and calculate the holographic central charge and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, respectively. In a similar manner, we present the $AdS_3\times\text{spindle}\ltimes\text{disk}$ and $AdS_2\times\text{spindle}\ltimes\text{disk}$ solutions.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry and symmetry defects in boundary conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state in a quantum system with a given global symmetry, $G$, can be sensitive to the presence of boundaries, which may either preserve or break this symmetry. In this work, we investigate how conformal invariant boundary conditions influence the $G-$symmetry breaking through the lens of the entanglement asymmetry, a quantifier of the "distance" between a symmetry-broken state and its symmetrized counterpart. By leveraging 2D boundary conformal field theory (BCFT), we investigate the symmetry breaking for both finite and compact Lie groups. Beyond the leading order term, we also compute the subleading corrections in the subsystem size, highlighting their dependence on the symmetry group $G$ and the BCFT operator content. We further explore the entanglement asymmetry following a global quantum quench, where a symmetry-broken state evolves under a symmetry-restoring Hamiltonian. In this dynamical setting, we compute the entanglement asymmetry by extending the method of images to a BCFT with non-local objects such as invertible symmetry defects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>FLPR Model: (Anti-)Chiral Supervariable Approach to Quantum Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss and derive the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anti-commuting Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST), anti-BRST, co-BRST and anti-co-BRST symmetry transformations for the non-interacting Friedberg-Lee-Pang-Ren (FLPR) model in one (0 + 1)-dimension (1D) of spacetime by exploiting the standard techniques of the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) onto (1, 1)-dimensional super sub-manifold of the general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold, where the (anti-) BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions play a crucial role. We provide clear proof of nilpotency and absolute anti-commutativity properties of the (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-) co-BRST Noether's conserved charges within the framework of ACSA to BRST formalism, where we take only one Grassmannian variable in place of two usual Grassmannian variables (i.e., fermionic variables). Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the Lagrangian of this non-interacting FLPR model is (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-)co-BRST symmetries invariance within the ambit of the ACSA to BRST approach in (1, 1)-dimensional spacetime.</description>

      <title>Does the stability of f(R) theories implies the stability of the dual scalar-tensor theory ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher curvature f(R) gravity theories are often plagued with Ostragadsky instability. In this work we show that such instability manifests itself in the corresponding dual scalar tensor theory in the scalar sector Lagrangian. We explicitly demonstrate the correspondence between the instabilities that appear in an $f(R)$ model and its corresponding scalar tensor theory. Considering various forms of f(R) gravity this feature is illustrated for different choices of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing A Finite Tension Domain Wall in $\phi^4_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently claimed that the domain wall in the 3+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ double-well model can be constructed as a squeezed, coherent state and that at one loop it has a finite tension given general, but unspecified, renormalization conditions. In the present note, we justify this claim by showing that the tadpole is finite and the infrared divergences cancel exactly. Also we carefully treat the renormalization of the normal ordering mass scale. Faddeev and Korepin have stressed that ultraviolet divergences cancel in the soliton sector if they cancel in the vacuum sector when the corresponding calculations are identical in the ultraviolet. We therefore renormalize the divergences in the vacuum sector using a Schrodinger picture prescription, which mirrors closely the analogous calculations in the domain wall sector.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Classes in Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By viewing black hole solutions as topological defects in thermodynamic parameter space, we unveil a novel topological class and two new topological subclasses, respectively denoted $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, $\overline{W}^{1+}$, and $\hat{W}^{1+}$, that extend beyond the four established categories proposed by Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)]. Within the newly identified class and these two novel subclasses, the innermost small black hole states exhibit a distinct sequence of unstable, stable, and stable behaviours, while the outermost large black hole states display a uniform pattern of stable behaviours. These classifications indicate thermodynamic properties in both the low and high Hawking temperature regimes that are strikingly different from the previously known four topological classes. In particular, we demonstrate that static charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravity exhibit an intricate thermodynamic evolution that is notably distinct from that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole. From a topological perspective, we emphasize the advantages and potential of investigating thermodynamic phase transitions in these black holes, an area that has been rarely explored in previous research. Our findings not only enrich and sharpen the framework of topological classifications in black hole thermodynamics, but also represent a significant stride toward unraveling the fundamental nature of black holes and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We identify half-wormhole contributions to the non averaged $\mathscr{N} =1$ supersymmetric SYK model in which time has been reduced to a point. As in previously studied examples, the inclusion of half-wormholes restores factorisation in the large $N$ limit. Wormholes as well as half-wormholes break supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Holographic striped superconductor with ionic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model to study the striped superconductor on ionic lattices. This model features a phase diagram with three distinct phases, namely the charge density wave (CDW) phase, ordinary superconducting phase (SC) and the striped superconducting phase (SSC). The effect of the ionic lattices on the phase diagram is investigated in detail. First, due to the periodic nature of the background, different types of CDW solutions can be found below the critical temperature. Furthermore, with the increase of the lattice amplitude these solutions are locked in different commensurate states. Second, we find that the critical temperature of CDW phase decreases with the increase of the lattice amplitude, while that of the SC phase increases. Additionally, the background solutions are obtained for different phases, and it is verified that the SSC phase has the lowest free energy among all three phases.</description>

      <title>On the fermionic van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate fermionic versions, for any number of spatial dimensions, of the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions, and study their properties. In both cases, the systems we introduce contain localized `atoms': two-level systems, coupled to a vacuum Dirac field. This Dirac field plays here a role akin to the electromagnetic field in the van der Waals case. In this context, bag-model conditions for the Dirac field serve as the analog of the 'mirror' in the Casimir-Polder effect. We found that, in this case, the resulting interaction is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in CFT with boundary symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem $A$ originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the Ricci Flow via Einstein Field Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how solutions to the Ricci flow on Lorentzian manifolds, along with its generalizations, can be linked to Einstein's field equations. The approach involves deformations of the matter sector that are generated by quadratic functionals of the stress-energy tensor. We provide illustrative examples by explicitly constructing analytical solutions within maximally symmetric spacetimes and in the context of Born-Infeld's nonlinear electrodynamics. Finally, we discuss configurations involving global topological monopoles, emphasizing the versatility of this approach across various geometric and physical settings.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamics of the black holes of the Cano-Ruip\'erez 4-dimensional string effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cano-Ruip\'erez 4-dimensional string effective action is the simplest consistent truncation of the first-order in $\alpha'$ heterotic string effective action compactified on T$^{6}$. This theory contains, on top of the metric, a dilaton and an axion that couple to the Gauss-Bonnet term and to the Pontrjagin density which suggests a very strong relation between the physical and geometrical properties of its solutions. In this paper we study the thermodynamics of the string black-hole solutions of this theory using Wald's formalism. We construct the on-shell closed generalized Komar, dilaton and axion 2-form charges, and we used them to find the Smarr formula (that we test on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions) and to prove no-(primary)-hair theorems for the scalar. We find that $\alpha'$ plays the role of a thermodynamical variable with an associated chemical potential. We also notice the occurrence of non-standard gravitational charges in the Wald entropy and scalar charges.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>The stress-energy tensor of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Canonical analysis of unimodular Pleba\'nski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in an extended non-commutative foliated quantum gravity: the wave function of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel extension to the recently developed non-commutative Riemannian foliated branch-cut quantum gravity (BCQG). Based on an extended Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic deformation of the conventional Poisson algebra, we investigate non-commutativity effects on a symplectic topological manifold that provides a natural isomorphic setting composed by a triad of canonically conjugate scalar complex fields which comprise quantum complementary dualities. Based on a complementary analytically continued Friedmann-type equation, combined with a quantum approach based on the Ho\v{r}awa-Lifshitz quantum gravity, we describe the dynamic evolution of the universe's wave function, unfolding unprecedented predictions for the cosmic evolution and inflation. The non-commutative foliated quantum gravity approach offers a new perspective on explaining the accelerated cosmic expansion of the universe, strongly suggesting that non-commutative algebra induces the late accelerated growth of both the universe's wave function and the corresponding scale factor, along with their quantum counterparts. In contrast to the conventional inflationary model, where inflation requires a remarkably fine-tuned set of initial conditions in a patch of the universe, non-commutative foliated quantum gravity, analytically continued to the complex plane, captures short and long scales of spacetime, leading to an evolutionary cosmic dynamic through a topological reconfiguration of the primordial cosmic matter and energy content. This result introduces new speculative framework elements regarding the reconfiguration of matter and energy due to an underlying non-commutative spatio-temporal structure as a driver of spacetime cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in curvature perturbation power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the ``double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large when the transition from the USR phase to the final attractor phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against the loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>The role of Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants in the context of the MUonE Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, the hadronic contribution plays a crucial role, especially given its large contribution to the final error. Currently, lattice QCD simulations are in disagreement with dispersive calculations based on $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross sections. The new MUonE experiment intends to shed light on this situation extracting the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$, from elastic $e\mu$ scattering. Still, due to the limited kinematic range that can be covered by the experiment, a powerful method must be devised to accurately extract the desired hadronic contribution from a new experiment of this type. In this work, we show how Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants profiting from the analyticity of the correlator governing the hadronic contribution can be a powerful tool in reaching the required precision.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum fields with Le'vy paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a path integral approach to quantum field theory that is defined over the paths of the Le'vy flights possessing a fractal dimension $1&lt;d_f&lt;2$. In standard quantum field theory, the fractality of the Brownian trajectories lead to a dispersion relation of quadric form. While the Le'vy paths lead fractional quantum field theory to a fractional dispersion relation. By considering Le'vy paths in time, we calculate density of states for a massless scalar field with box boundary condition. The density of states show behaviors dual to lower dimensional system, and the corresponding black body radiation has an energy spectrum dual to that in lower dimensional black body radiation. We derive the fractional equations of motion for scalar field, vector field and spinor field in zero temperature. Their propagators have been calculated. Based on above derivation, we calculate the one-loop self-energy of electron in Lev'y paths to show how this scheme works equally in renormalization as dimensional regularization does. Nevertheless, We found that gauge symmetry prevent Dirac spinor field from Le'vy paths and demonstrate that these paths in Dirac spinor field leds to unstable electrons, thus Le'vy paths are overcame by ordinary Brownian paths. While Le'vy paths are permitted in electromagnetic field by gauge symmetry. It led to a non-local phase and interaction with electron where electron charge is a composite quantity rather than a fundamental constant which maybe physically observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For physicists: For supersymmetric quantum mechanics, there are cases when a mod-2 Witten index can be defined, even when a more ordinary $\mathbb{Z}$-valued Witten index vanishes. Similarly, for 2d supersymmetric quantum field theories, there are cases when a mod-2 elliptic genus can be defined, even when a more ordinary elliptic genus vanishes. We study such mod-2 elliptic genera in the context of $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ supersymmetry, and show that they are characterized by mod-2 reductions of integral modular forms, under some assumptions.
  For mathematicians: We study the image of the standard homomorphism $\pi_n \mathrm{TMF}\to \pi_n \mathrm{KO}((q))\simeq \mathbb{Z}/2((q))$ for $n=8k+1$ or $8k+2$, by relating them to the mod-2 reductions of integral modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the computational evidence for the Bose$\small-$Fermi duality of fundamental fields coupled to $U(N)$ Chern$\small-$Simons theories originates in large-$N$ calculations performed in the light-cone gauge. This gauge is ill-suited to computations in curved spacetimes, like the evaluation of the partition function on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$ for arbitrary genus $g$. In this paper, we use another gauge, the 'temporal' gauge, to set up the computation of this partition function. In the large-$N$ limit, and the special case $\Sigma_g=\mathbb{R}^2$, we take the computation through to the end by setting up and solving the gap equations, generalizing tricks explored in arXiv:1410.0558 to finite temperature. Our final results are in perfect agreement with earlier light-cone gauge results, providing a consistency check of both the formalism developed in this paper as well as previously performed light-cone gauge computations. In a follow-up paper, we will report on using our formalism to explicitly compute the partition function on $S^2 \times S^1$ for a finite-sized sphere.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the renormalization of scale-free quadratic gravity coupled to the bumblebee field and its potential for dynamically breaking Lorentz symmetry. We conduct one-loop renormalization of the model and calculate the associated renormalization group functions. Furthermore, we compute the one-loop effective potential for the bumblebee field, demonstrating that it acquires a non-trivial vacuum expectation value (VEV) through radiative corrections -- a phenomenon known as the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This spontaneous breaking of scale invariance, driven by the non-zero VEV of the bumblebee field, leads to Lorentz symmetry violation. As a result, the non-minimal coupling between the bumblebee and gravitational fields induces a spontaneous generation of an Einstein-Hilbert term via radiative corrections, suggesting a possible link between the Planck scale and Lorentz violation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>

      <title>Mixed Gauge-Global Symmetries, Elliptic Modes, and Black Hole Thermodynamics in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, a putative consistent theory of quantum gravity for which there is evidence for both black hole thermodynamics and a holographic construction, spacetime is endowed with a preferred dynamical spacelike foliation. The theory has a leaf reparameterization symmetry that is neither global nor local gauge, hyperbolic and elliptic equations of motion, a lack of splittability, and universal horizon black hole solutions. The reparameterization symmetry is ``mixed'': it is a local symmetry in one coordinate yet global on each leaf. More broadly it is an example of both unfree and projectable gauge symmetries. The mixed symmetry and associated charge has not yet been accounted for in calculations of universal horizon thermodynamics in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. This has led to problems, in particular the failure of the first law in a class of asymptotically AdS solutions where the normal to the leaves of the foliation is not aligned with the time translation Killing vector at infinity. We show how the dynamics of the charge corresponding to this symmetry coupled with the other features above resolves this issue. We then briefly comment how this mixed symmetry, the corresponding charge, and the elliptic equations of motion also conspire to evade recent holographic arguments for only local gauge fields in consistent theories of quantum gravity due to the lack of splittability of the elliptic equation and associated mode.</description>

Abstract: We study 1-parameter families of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We show that the expected codimension-1 phenomena can be organized to match the HOMFLYPT skein relations from quantum topology. It follows that counting holomorphic curves by the class of their boundaries in the skein module of the Lagrangian gives a deformation invariant result. This is a mathematically rigorous incarnation of Witten's assertion that boundaries of open topological strings create line defects in Chern-Simons theory.
  Using this theory, we rigorously establish the following prediction of Ooguri and Vafa: the coefficients of the HOMFLYPT polynomial of a link in the three-sphere count the holomorphic curves in the resolved conifold, with boundary on (a pushoff of) the link conormal.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Fiducial Structures in Minisuperspace Reduction and Quantum Fluctuations in LQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spatially non-compact minisuperpace models, spatial integrals in the Hamiltonian and symplectic form must be regularised by confining them to a finite volume $V_o$, known as the fiducial cell. As this restriction is unnecessary in the complete theory before homogeneous reduction, the physical significance of the fiducial cell has been largely debated, especially in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Understanding its role is in turn essential for assessing the minisuperspace description's validity and its connection to the full theory. In this work we present a systematic procedure for reduction to spatially homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspaces within the canonical framework and apply it to a massive scalar field theory and gravity. Our strategy consists in implementing spatial homogeneity via second-class constraints for discrete field modes over a partitioning of the spatial slice into countably many disjoint cells. The reduced theory's canonical structure is then given by the corresponding Dirac bracket. Importantly, the latter can only be defined on a finite number of cells patched together. This identifies a finite region, the fiducial cell, whose physical size acquires then a precise meaning already at the classical level as the scale over which homogenenity is imposed. Additionally, the procedure allows to track the information lost during reduction and how the error depends on $V_o$. We then move to the quantisation of the classically reduced theories, focusing on the relation between theories for different $V_o$, and study the implications for statistical moments, quantum fluctuations, and semiclassical states. In the case of a quantum scalar field, a subsector of the full quantum field theory where the results from the "first reduced, then quantised" approach can be reproduced is identified and the conditions for this to be a good approximation are also determined.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction in Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Soft-photon theorem for pion-proton elastic scattering revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the reactions $\pi p \to \pi p$ and $\pi p \to \pi p \gamma$ from a general quantum field theory (QFT) point of view, describing these reactions in QCD and lowest relevant order of electromagnetism. We consider the pion-proton elastic scattering both off shell and on shell. The on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ scattering are described by two invariant amplitudes, while the off-shell amplitudes contain eight invariant amplitudes. We study the photon emission amplitudes in the soft-photon limit where the c.m. photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes is considered and the terms of the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. These terms can be expressed by the on-shell invariant amplitudes and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and $t$. The pole term $\propto \omega^{-1}$ in the amplitudes corresponds to Weinberg's soft-photon theorem and is well known from the literature. We derive the next-to-leading term $\propto \omega^{0}$ using only rigorous methods of QFT. We give the relation of the Laurent series for $\pi^{0} p \to \pi^{0} p \gamma$ and Low's soft-photon theorem. Our formulas for the amplitudes in the limit $\omega \to 0$ are valid for photon momentum $k$ satisfying $k^{2} \geqslant 0$, $k^{0} = \omega \geqslant 0$, that is, for both real and virtual photons. Here we consider a limit where with $\omega \to 0$ we have also $k^{2} \to 0$. We discuss the behavior of the corresponding cross-sections for $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{-} p \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$. We consider cross sections for unpolarized as well as polarized protons in the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>A coupling prescription for post-Newtonian corrections in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum theory and general relativity remains one of the main challenges of modern physics. A renewed interest in the low-energy limit is driven by the prospect of new experiments that could probe this interface. Here we develop a covariant framework for expressing post-Newtonian corrections to Schr\"odinger's equation on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds based on a $1/c^2$ expansion of Lorentzian geometry, where $c$ is the speed of light. Our framework provides a generic coupling prescription of quantum systems to gravity that is valid in the intermediate regime between Newtonian gravity and General Relativity, and that retains the focus on geometry. At each order in $1/c^2$ this produces a nonrelativistic geometry to which quantum systems at that order couple. By considering the gauge symmetries of both the nonrelativistic geometries and the $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon field, we devise a prescription that allows us to derive the Schr\"odinger equation and its post-Newtonian corrections on a gravitational background order-by-order in $1/c^2$. We also demonstrate that these results can be obtained from a $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon Lagrangian. We illustrate our methods by performing the $1/c^2$ expansion of the Kerr metric up to $\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$, which leads to a special case of the Hartle--Thorne metric. The associated Schr\"odinger equation captures novel and potentially measurable effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we stated conjectural presentations for the equivariant quantum K ring of partial flag varieties, motivated by physics considerations. In this companion paper, we analyze these presentations mathematically. We start by proving a Nakayama type result for quantum K theory: if the conjectured set of relations deforms a complete set of relations of the classical K theory ring, then they must form a complete set of relations for the quantum K ring. We prove the conjectured presentation in the case of the incidence varieties, and we show that if a quantum K divisor axiom holds (as conjectured by Buch and Mihalcea), then the conjectured presentation also holds for the complete flag variety. Finally, we briefly revisit the change of variables relating the mathematics and physics presentations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible relationship between the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and the universe's quantum complexity can be established in the context of a new proposal for quantum gravity, according to which spacetime must emerge from quantum correlations without correlata. Such a bridge between $H_{0}$ and the universe's complexity can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart and Gong and extended by Auclair and Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum fully expanded around a pivot scale up to N3LO, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectra of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to the effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation in metric variables. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_\ast$. Surprisingly, we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_\ast = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation and a prediction of a negative running $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=-\frac{1}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2+\ldots$ of the scalar tilt. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Multiform for Cyclotomic Gaudin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian multiform for the class of cyclotomic (rational) Gaudin models by formulating its hierarchy within the Lie dialgebra framework of Semenov-Tian-Shansky and by using the framework of Lagrangian multiforms on coadjoint orbits. This provides the first example of a Lagrangian multiform for an integrable hierarchy whose classical $r$-matrix is non-skew-symmetric and spectral parameter-dependent. As an important by-product of the construction, we obtain a Lagrangian multiform for the periodic Toda chain by choosing an appropriate realisation of the cyclotomic Gaudin Lax matrix. This fills a gap in the landscape of Toda models as only the open and infinite chains had been previously cast into the Lagrangian multiform framework. A slightly different choice of realisation produces the so-called discrete self-trapping (DST) model. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by coupling the periodic Toda chain with the DST model and by obtaining a Lagrangian multiform for the corresponding integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realization of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among Cosmic Microwave Background observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? We study a low-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles are stable particles can comprise a measurable part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the Square Kilometer Array. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula, which can work if dark matter is collisional, so interacting dark matter. Without specifying a model for interacting dark matter, thus choosing an agnostic approach for interacting dark matter, we assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by interacting dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs) as known as align-spin (AS) functions, employing the framework of twisted quark states. We reveal that these twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. The proposed method is quite general and can be used for the standard TMDs. In contrast to the previous studies, the presented approach focuses on the leading order of interactions, providing a simplified and robust alternative to the methods based on the traditional $\mathbb{S}$-matrix expansion. We highlight that the critical dependence of transverse momentum arises not only from interactions but also from significant contributions linked to orbital angular momentum (OAM), influenced by the transverse momentum characteristics of correlators. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>
