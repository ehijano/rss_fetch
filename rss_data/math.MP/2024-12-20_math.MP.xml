      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetries for the Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics Equations in a Rotating Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed Lie symmetry analysis for the hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that describe the one-dimensional Shallow Water magnetohydrodynamics equations within a rotating reference frame. We consider a relaxing condition $\mathbf{\mathbf{\nabla }}\left( h\mathbf{B} \right) \neq 0$ for the one-dimensional problem, which has been used to overcome unphysical behaviors. The hyperbolic system of partial differential equations depends on two parameters: the constant gravitational potential $g$ and the Coriolis term $f_{0}$, related to the constant rotation of the reference frame. For four different cases, namely $g=0,~f_{0}=0$; $g\neq 0\,,~f_{0}=0$; $g=0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$; and $g\neq 0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$ the admitted Lie symmetries for the hyperbolic system form different Lie algebras. Specifically the admitted Lie algebras are the $L^{10}=\left\{ A_{3,3}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} \otimes _{s}A_{5,34}^{a}$; $% L^{8}=A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{6,22}$; $L^{7}=A_{3,5}\rtimes\left\{ A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} $; and $L^{6}=A_{3,5}\rtimes A_{3,3}~$respectively, where we use the Morozov-Mubarakzyanov-Patera classification scheme. For the general case where $f_{0}g\neq 0$, we derive all the invariants for the Adjoint action of the Lie algebra $L^{6}$ and its subalgebras, and we calculate all the elements of the one-dimensional optimal system. These elements are then considered to define similarity transformations and construct analytic solutions for the hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Clifford geometric algebra: Real and complex spinor data tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern algebra concepts are used to construct tables of algebraic spinors related to Clifford algebra multivectors with real and complex coefficients. The following data computed by Mathematica are presented in form of tables for individual Clifford geometric algebras: 1. Initial idempotent; 2. Two-sided ideal; 3. Left ideal basis (otherwise projector, or spinor basis); 4. Matrix representations (reps) for basis vectors in Clifford algebras in spinor basis; 5. General spinor; 6. Spinor in matrix form; 7. Squared hermitian norm of the spinor. Earlier in 1998, only the first four items computed by Maple were published by R. Ablamowicz.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a variational principle.</description>

      <title>Heat Conduction with {\it aging} memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term material with memory is generally used to indicate materials whose mechanical and/or thermodynamical behaviour depends not only on the process at the present time but also on the history of the process itself. Crucial in heat conductors with memory is the heat relaxation function which models the thermal response of the material. The present study is concerned about a thermodynamical problem with memory "aging"; that is, we analyze the temperature evolution within a rigid heat conductor with memory whose relaxation function takes into account the aging of the material. In particular, we account for variations of the relaxation function due to a possible deterioration of the thermal response of the material related to its age.</description>

      <title>Solving Unbalanced Optimal Transport on Point Cloud by Tangent Radial Basis Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem on surfaces represented by point clouds. Based on alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, the original UOT problem can be solved by an iteration consists of three steps. The key ingredient is to solve a Poisson equation on point cloud which is solved by tangent radial basis function (TRBF) method. The proposed TRBF method requires only the point cloud and normal vectors to discretize the Poisson equation which simplify the computation significantly. Numerical experiments conducted on point clouds with varying geometry and topology demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Representations of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ and its Borel Subalgebras at Roots of Unity and Q-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic representations $\Omega_{rs}$ of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ that depend upon two points $r,s$ in the chiral Potts algebraic curve. We show how $\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the tensor product $\rho_r\otimes \bar{\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator representation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the Q-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\tau_2$ models.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Planon-modular fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-convolution-invariant shell approximation to spherically-symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of functions Omega_N(x; mu, nu) in N-dimensional space concentrated around a spherical shell of the radius mu and such that, being convoluted with an isotropic Gaussian function, these functions do not change their expression but only a value of its 'width' parameter, nu. Isotropic Gaussian functions are a particular case of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) corresponding to mu = 0. Due to their features, these functions are an efficient tool to build approximations to smooth and continuous spherically-symmetric functions including oscillating ones. Atomic images in limited-resolution maps of the electron density, electrostatic scattering potential and other scalar fields studied in physics, chemistry, biology, and other natural sciences are examples of such functions. We give simple analytic expressions of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) for N = 1, 2, 3 and analyze properties of these functions. Representation of oscillating functions by a sum of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) allows calculating distorted maps for the same cost as the respective theoretical fields. We give practical examples of such representation for the interference functions of the uniform unit spheres for N = 1, 2, 3 that define the resolution of the respective images. Using the chain rule and analytic expressions of the Omega_N(x; mu, nu) derivatives makes simple refinement of parameters of the models which describe these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <title>Verlinde rings and cluster algebras arising from quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a positivity conjecture relating the Verlinde ring associated with an untwisted affine Lie algebra at a positive integer level and a subcategory of finite-dimensional representations over the corresponding quantum affine algebra with a cluster algebra structure. Specifically, we consider a ring homomorphism from the Grothendieck ring of this representation category to the Verlinde ring and conjecture that every object in the category has a positive image under this map.
  We prove this conjecture in certain cases where the underlying simple Lie algebra is simply-laced with level 2 or of type $A_1$ at an arbitrary level. The proof employs the close connection between this category and cluster algebras of finite cluster type. As further evidence for the conjecture, we show that for any level, all objects have positive quantum dimensions under the assumption that some Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules have positive quantum dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. On a sphere, we employ the properties of spherical convolution to study the bifurcation branches around the uniform state. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel and compare it to the Euclidean setting. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Expansion into the vacuum of stochastic gases with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential; each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. When $s&lt;d$, the expansion is governed by non-local hydrodynamic equations. In the one-dimensional case, we deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit: The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each Floquet eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a hybrid regular and chaotic system, we use the energy dispersion to separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of Gaussian random band matrices of dimension $N \times N$ and band-width $W$. We show that delocalization holds for bulk eigenvectors and that quantum diffusion holds for the resolvent, all under the assumption that $W \gg N^{8/11}$. Our analysis is based on a flow method, and a refinement of it may lead to an improvement on the condition $W \gg N^{8/11}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-structure, i.e. a differential graded symplectic structure, on a graded cotangent bundle as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above symplectic structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms are constructed from this structure. Moreover, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are obtained systematically.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed in terms of the properties of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $II_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP $\mathbf{2023}$, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On microlocalisation and the construction of Feynman Propagators for normally hyperbolic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article gives global microlocalisation constructions for normally hyperbolic operators on a vector bundle over a globally hyperbolic spacetime in geometric terms. As an application, this is used to generalise the Duistermaat-H\"{o}rmander construction of Feynman propagators, therefore incorporating the most important non-scalar geometric operators. It is shown that for normally hyperbolic operators that are selfadjoint with respect to a hermitian bundle metric, the Feynman propagators can be constructed to satisfy a positivity property that reflects the existence of Hadamard states in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. We also give a more direct construction of the Feynman propagators for Dirac-type operators on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Even though the natural bundle metric on spinors is not positive-definite, in this case, we can give a direct microlocal construction of a Feynman propagator that satisfies positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an abstract result giving a $\langle t \rangle^\varepsilon$ upper bound on the growth of the Sobolev norms of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the form ${i} \dot \psi = H_0 \psi + V (t)\psi$. Here $H_0$ is assumed to be the Hamiltonian of a steep quantum integrable system and to be a pseudodifferential operator of order ${\tt d} &gt; 1$; $V (t)$ is a time-dependent family of pseudodifferential operators, unbounded, but of order ${\tt b} &lt; {\tt d}$. The abstract theorem is then applied to perturbations of the quantum anharmonic oscillators in dimension 2 and to perturbations of the Laplacian on a manifold with integrable geodesic flow, and in particular Zoll manifolds, rotation invariant surfaces and Lie groups. The proof is based on a quantum version of the proof of the classical Nekhoroshev theorem.</description>

      <title>A note on the bulk interpretation of the Quantum Extremal Surface formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining quantum information quantities directly in bulk quantum gravity is a difficult problem due to the fluctuations of spacetime. Some progress was made recently in \cite{Mertens:2022ujr}, which provided a bulk interpretation of the Bekenstein Hawking formula for two sided BTZ black holes in terms of the entanglement entropy of gravitational edge modes. We generalize those results to give a bulk entanglement entropy interpretation of the quantum extremal surface formula in AdS3 gravity, as applied to a single interval in the boundary theory. Our computation further supports the proposal that AdS3 gravity can be viewed as a topological phase in which the bulk gravity edge modes are anyons transforming under the quantum group $\SL^{+}_{q}(2,\mathbb{R})$. These edge modes appear when we cut open the Euclidean path integral along bulk co-dimension 2 slices, and satisfies a shrinkable boundary condition which ensures that the Gibbons-Hawking calculation gives the correct state counting.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new framework of Hessian-free force-gradient integrators that do not require the analytical expression of the force-gradient term based on the Hessian of the potential. Due to that the new class of decomposition algorithms for separable Hamiltonian systems with quadratic kinetic energy may be particularly useful when applied to Hamiltonian systems where an evaluation of the Hessian is significantly more expensive than an evaluation of its gradient, e.g. in molecular dynamics simulations of classical systems. Numerical experiments of an N-body problem, as well as applications to the molecular dynamics step in the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for lattice simulations of the Schwinger model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) verify these expectations.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</description>

      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of 3 equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times Z_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the spectrum restricted to the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, for strong coupling, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths while the spectral form factor displays a nonuniversal peak at short times. Moreover, deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra projected to the identity representation at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of light-matter interactions in degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Twisted vertex algebra modules for irregular connections: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex algebra with an action of a group $G$ comes with a notion of $g$-twisted modules, forming a $G$-crossed braided tensor category. For a Lie group $G$, one might instead wish for a notion of $(\mathrm{d}+A)$-twisted modules for any $\mathfrak{g}$-connection on the formal punctured disc. For connections with a regular singularity, this reduces to $g$-twisted modules, where $g$ is the monodromy around the puncture. The case of an irregular singularity is much richer and involved, and we are not aware that it has appeared in vertex algebra language. The present article is intended to spark such a treatment, by providing a list of expectations and an explicit worked-through example with interesting applications.
  Concretely, we consider the vertex super algebra of symplectic fermions, or equivalently the triplet vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $p=2$, and study its twisted module with respect to irregular $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-connections. We first determine the category of representations, depending on the formal type of the connection. Then we prove that a Sugawara type construction gives a Virasoro action and we prove that as Virasoro modules our representations are direct sums of Whittaker modules.
  Conformal field theory with irregular singularities resp. wild ramification appear in the context of geometric Langlands correspondence, and in particular in work by Witten, higher dimensional field theories and AGT correspondence. Our original motivation comes from semiclassical limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, which fibres over the space of connections [FL24], similar to the affine Lie algebra at critical level. Our present article now describes, in the smallest case, the fibres of this category over irregular connections.</description>

      <title>TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.</description>

      <title>Principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and examine the notion of principal $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-bundles, i.e., principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds. The latter are higher graded extensions of supermanifolds in which a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-grading replaces $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading. These extensions have opened up new areas of research of great interest in both physics and mathematics. In principle, the geometry of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is essentially different than that of supermanifolds, as for $n&gt;1$ we have formal variables of even parity, so local smooth functions are formal power series. On the other hand, a full version of differential calculus is still valid. We show in this paper that the fundamental properties of classical principal bundles can be generalised to the setting of this `higher graded' geometry, with properly defined frame bundles of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-vector bundles as canonical examples. However, formulating these concepts and proving these results relies on many technical upshots established in earlier papers. A comprehensive introduction to $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is therefore included together with basic examples.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>
