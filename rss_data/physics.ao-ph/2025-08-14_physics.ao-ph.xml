      <title>Machine Learning for Cloud Detection in IASI Measurements: A Data-Driven SVM Approach with Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency Earth Explorer Mission.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>
