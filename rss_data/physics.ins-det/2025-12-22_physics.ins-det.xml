      <title>SPIDER, a Waveform Digitizer ASIC for picosecond timing in LHCb PicoCal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the architecture, design and first test results of SPIDER, the first prototype of a TSMC CMOS 65 nm ASIC designed for the time measurement path of LHCb Electromagnetic Calorimeter after LS4 Upgrade.
  The main requirements for the readout of this detector are a time resolution below 15 ps rms above 5 GeV, and a channel occupancy up to 30\% (12 Mevent/s).
  The first prototype called SPIDER\_V0 is a 2-channel waveform digitizer locked on the LHC clock allowing precise time reconstruction by digital algorithms. The architecture is based on 2 DLLs in series controlling respectively the phase of the sampling window and the sampling frequency, the latter covering the range between 2 and 20 GS/s. Each self-triggering channel houses 8 banks of 32 analog memory cells and a massively parallel Wilkinson ADC for conversion at 5 GHz over 10 bits with a maximal conversion time of 200 ns.
  SPIDER targets not only LHCb, but all fast detectors mounted on current and future accelerators. Its sampling frequency can indeed be adjusted to different signal risetimes. Its main frequency of 40 MHz could even be eventually locked to another value by modifying only one of the DLLs in the chip design.</description>

      <title>Supersampled scanning transmission X-ray microscopy for high-resolution vibration-free imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a nanoscale imaging technique that can utilize several powerful contrast mechanisms for the quantitative mapping of chemical and physical materials properties. Spatial resolutions down to 7~nm at the soft X-ray energy range have been demonstrated. A limiting factor for high-resolution STXM imaging is given by the positioning precision of the sample with respect to the focusing optic, with the current state-of-the-art leading to significant overheads, especially at low pixel dwell times, and being vulnerable to unavoidable external vibrations sources. In this work, we present a method, called supersampled scanning microscopy, that allows for a significant reduction of overhead times while simultaneously removing the effects of vibrational noise by sampling the position of the sample at a rate significantly higher than the vibration spectrum and reconstructing the sample transmission image from the recorded list of positions and detector counts. We demonstrate the performance of the technique with a set of proof-of-concept high-resolution imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>In situ substrate birefringence characterization in gravitational wave detectors using a heterodyne polarimetry method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality test mass substrates play essential roles in laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Inhomogeneous birefringence distribution in test mass substrates, however, can degrade the sensitivity of the detector by introducing the optical loss and disturbing the interferometer controls. In this paper, we present a heterodyne polarimetry method that enables in situ birefringence characterizations, hence diagnosing the gravitational wave interferometer. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed method with a tabletop setup. We also discuss its applicability to current and future gravitational wave detectors and the detectable limit.</description>

      <title>Towards Halbach Spheres -- Icosahedral Symmetry Is Not Just Cool Anymore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halbach spheres provide a theoretically elegant means of generating highly homogeneous magnetic fields, but practical implementation is hindered by challenging fabrication and restricted interior access. This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids. Analytical calculations, numerical field simulations, and experimental measurements indicate that polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry achieve the most favorable balance among field strength, homogeneity, and interior accessibility. They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%. The findings establish discrete icosahedrally symmetric magnet arrays as practical, scalable building blocks for compact, highly homogeneous magnetic field sources suited to mobile magnetic resonance, and magnetophoretic applications.</description>

      <title>First results of a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor with Internal Signal Gain Fully Integrated in a 180 nm CMOS Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense tracking environments in experiments at CERN's High-Luminosity LHC and future FCC experiments call for an increased use of timing information in addition to the position measurement of pixel detectors. This adds one dimension to the information available, and is essential for pile-up mitigation at high luminosity. The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors. Fast signal rise time due to internal charge amplification improves the response time and timing resolution, all of which makes such a technology attractive for future 4D tracking applications in HEP experiments. This paper presents the first results of the CASSIA sensor, a novel MAPS which uses gain layers fully integrated in a 180nm imaging process to achieve internal signal amplification. In the first measurements presented here we demonstrate the gain behaviour of different pixel implant designs and show that the sensor can be operated with low gain proportional mode as LGAD sensor at lower voltages and as SPAD sensor at higher voltages.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Calibration of Large Liquid Detectors with Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel method to extract photomultiplier tube (PMT) calibration timing constants in large liquid scintillation detectors from physics data using the machinery of unsupervised deep learning. The approach uses a simplified physical model of optical photon transport in the loss function, with PMT calibration constants treated as free parameters, and the simple assumption that individual events represent point-like emission. The problem is, thus, effectively reduced to that of regression on a very large scale, made tractable by deep learning architectures and automatic differentiation frameworks. Using data from the 9,300 PMTs in the SNO+ detector, the method has been shown to reliably extract 3 calibration constants for each of the over 7,500 online PMTs using radioactive background events. We believe that this basic approach can be straightforwardly generalised for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Enabled Nanoscale X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (nanoXPEEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating two-dimensional materials for real-world applications remains challenging due to a lack of effective and high-throughput characterization techniques. Soft X-ray time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides element- and depth-sensitive information of materials and buried interfaces. However, chromatic and spherical aberrations cannot be corrected with electron-lens combinations. These aberrations, combined with astigmatism and space-charge effects, significantly degrade the spatial and energy resolutions. To overcome this limitation, we outline a spatial-attention based deep learning approach to automatically correct for these effects and attain nanometer resolution over the entire field-of-view (FoV). The combination of this corrective algorithm with XPEEM, termed as nanoXPEEM, establishes a new record of 48-nm spatial resolution with a 232-micrometer diameter FoV in the soft x-ray regime (700-1000 eV). nanoXPEEM provides unique spatial mapping of the element-specificity, depth-sensitivity, and local structure on the nanoscale. It can bridge the current gap to achieve angstrom (atomic) scale resolution.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase nano-imaging with a laboratory source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the structure of matter at the nanoscale non destructively is a key capability enabled by X-ray imaging. One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Fully stabilized 25 GHz frequency comb for frequency calibration of optical spectrum analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectrometers are widely used in scientific and industrial applications, and precise frequency calibration is essential for ensuring their reliable performance. Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the first wafer-scale prototype for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade: the monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.</description>

      <title>A nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity for single-molecule trapping and analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecules exhibit dynamic conformations critical to their functions, yet observing these processes at the single-molecule level under native conditions remains a formidable challenge. While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult. Here, we introduce a nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity that enables precise, non-perturbative trapping of individual biomolecules for extended observation times, eliminating the need for external forces. Using nucleosomes as model systems, we demonstrate single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor relative distances. Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules. We envision this nanocavity platform as a powerful tool for interrogating molecular dynamics in physiologically relevant environments, offering unperturbed access to weak and transient interactions that are central to biological regulation.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks with sub-microsecond inference latency are required by many critical applications. Targeting such applications deployed on FPGAs, we present High Granularity Quantization (HGQ), a quantization-aware training framework that optimizes parameter bit-widths through gradient descent. Unlike conventional methods, HGQ determines the optimal bit-width for each parameter independently, making it suitable for hardware platforms supporting heterogeneous arbitrary precision arithmetic. In our experiments, HGQ shows superior performance compared to existing network compression methods, achieving orders of magnitude reduction in resource consumption and latency while maintaining the accuracy on several benchmark tasks. These improvements enable the deployment of complex models previously infeasible due to resource or latency constraints. HGQ is open-source and is used for developing next-generation trigger systems at the CERN ATLAS and CMS experiments for particle physics, enabling the use of advanced machine learning models for real-time data selection with sub-microsecond latency.</description>
