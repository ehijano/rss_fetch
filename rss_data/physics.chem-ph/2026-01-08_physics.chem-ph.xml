      <title>Scale-Dependent Velocity Fluctuations Generated by Molecular Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete binomial random-walk description of molecular collisions is used to quantify the variance of coarse-grained velocity fields arising solely from collision-induced momentum exchange. Closed-form expressions for the growth of velocity variance as functions of coarse-graining scale and time are derived and shown to imply a power-law decay of variance with averaging scale. Particle-based ensemble simulations validate the predicted scaling and temporal behaviour; surrogate ensemble tests demonstrate that phase/temporal coherence is required for the observed integrated transfer diagnostics. The analysis is intentionally restricted to collision-generated fluctuations in quiescent fluids and does not model cascade dynamics; implications for possible amplification under inertial dynamics are discussed cautiously. All data and the minimal verification instructions required to reproduce the summary tables are embedded in Appendix A.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided Discovery of Novel Ionic Liquid Solvents for Industrial CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.</description>

      <title>Robust and fragile quantum effects in the transfer kinetics of delocalized excitons between B850 units of LH2 complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregates of light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes form the major exciton-relaying domain in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Structure-Performance Trade-offs in Porous Transport Layers for PEM Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Approach for Modulating Frontier Orbitals of Prototypical Organic Dyes for efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategic incorporation of heteroatoms (N, O, and B) into organic dyes is a versatile and effective approach to enhance molecular properties. This approach is highly attractive for tailoring organic solar cells, as it allows for precise control over the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, enabling the design and customization of organic molecules with desired optical and electronic properties. In this work, we aim to contribute to this pursuit by exploring novel charge transfer materials with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), specifically using the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA). This study evaluates two distinct parameter-tuning strategies for the range-separated hybrid (RSH) functional. The first uses a simplified scheme $\omega_{eff}$, while the second implements a more intricate protocol $\omega_{IP}$ designed to reproduce the exact ionization potential. The accuracy of the effective-tuning ($\omega_{eff}$) method was tested against experimental values of ionization potentials for BN-doped organic molecules. A comparative analysis of our data reveals that the accuracy of the ($\omega_{eff}$) approach is superior to that of the more complicated ($\omega_{IP}$) method and comparable to wave function theory (WFT).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Learning of Static and Dynamic Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Reshaping and quantifying inter- and intramolecular exchange in signal amplification by reversible exchange of pyruvate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique in which the transient interaction of parahydrogen (pH2) and a target substrate with an iridium complex leads to polarization transfer to the substrate. Here, we use a parahydrogen-enhanced, spin-selective NMR method to investigate pyruvate binding, which is combined with exchange-model fitting and DFT calculations. Our study reveals several key findings that reshape the current understanding of SABRE: (a) intramolecular hydrogen exchange of the hydrides, occurring faster than pyruvate or H2 loss; (b) the discovery of a novel stable H2-IrImes-DMSO2-pyruvate complex; and (c) the crucial role of counterions, here Na+, in Ir-pyruvate binding. Previously unknown insights into complex kinetics and distributions as a function of temperature, [DMSO], [pyruvate], and hydrogen pressure are presented. The methods demonstrated here, exemplified by SABRE, provide a framework that is expected to guide future research in the field.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Force Fields for Macromolecular Systems Through Long-Range Aware Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have revolutionized molecular simulations by providing quantum mechanical accuracy at the speed of molecular mechanical computations. However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Mode Floquet Fewest Switches Surface Hopping for Nonadiabatic Dynamics Driven by Two-Frequency Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-frequency (two-color) laser fields provide a powerful and flexible means for steering molecular dynamics. However, quantitatively reliable and scalable theoretical tools for simulating laser-driven nonadiabatic processes under such fields remain limited. Here, we develop a two-mode Floquet fewest switches surface hopping (two-mode F-FSSH) approach for two-frequency driving within a mixed quantum-classical framework. We validate the algorithm on three driven one-dimensional two-state models: a Rabi model and two avoided-crossing scattering models. The electronic and nuclear dynamics are benchmarked against numerically exact results from split-operator calculations, showing good agreement across a broad range of field parameters and initial conditions. These results establish two-mode F-FSSH as a practical framework for simulating and designing two-frequency control protocols and motivate extensions to more realistic experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum-Aware Machine Learning: Improved Prediction of Quantum Dissipative Dynamics via Complex Valued Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling quantum dissipative dynamics remains challenging due to environmental complexity and non-Markovian memory effects. Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fromager and Lasorne [Electron. Struct. 6 025002 (2024)] have recently derived an in-principle exact Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) of electrons and nuclei, where the nuclear density and the (so-called conditional) electronic density are mapped onto a fictitious electronically non-interacting KS molecule. In this work, we apply the exact factorization formalism to the molecular KS wavefunction, thus leading to disentangled (but coupled) marginal and conditional KS equations. We show that, while being equivalent to the original theory, these equations open new perspectives in the practical extension of regular (electronic) KS-DFT beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The importance and treatment of correlations induced in this context by second-order geometrical derivatives is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations and quantum rate theories to elucidate the complex condensed-phase dynamics underpinning triplet-state formation in organic photosensitizers. Using models informed by first-principles calculations complete with a molecular representation of solvents of different polarities, we elucidate the interplay of the internal and environmental interactions underlying triplet yield. We find that triplet yields depend sensitively on the dielectric stabilization of the charge transfer intermediate that facilitates a transition into the triplet manifold. Our results illustrate the importance of molecularly detailed models in understanding the excited-state internal charge-transfer dynamics of small organic molecules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple relativistic exact 2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian that models two-electron picture-change effects using Lehtola's superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) [S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. The SAP-X2C approach keeps the low-cost and technical simplicity of the popular 1-electron X2C (1eX2C) predecessor, but is significantly more accurate and has a well-defined thermodynamic limit, making it applicable to extended systems (such as periodic crystals). The assessment of the SAP-X2C-based Hartree-Fock total and spinor energies, spin-orbit splittings, equilibrium bond distances, and harmonic vibrational frequencies suggests that SAP-X2C is similar to the more complex atomic mean-field (AMF) X2C counterparts in the ability to approximate the 4-component Dirac-Hartree-Fock reference.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Heteroskedasticity and Resolving Multicollinearity Paradoxes in Physicochemical Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24643v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipophilicity (logP) prediction remains central to drug discovery, yet linear regression models for this task frequently violate statistical assumptions in ways that invalidate their reported performance metrics. We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA). These findings demonstrate that standard linear models face fundamental challenges for computed lipophilicity prediction and provide a principled framework for interpreting ensemble models in QSAR applications.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Reaction Embedding Descriptor Capturing Bond Transformation Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.</description>

      <title>Electron capture induced fragmentation of CO$_2^{3+}$: Influence of projectile charge on sequential and concerted break-up pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\text{O}^+:\text{C}^+:\text{O}^+$ fragmentation channel of CO$_2^{3+}$ produced in slow collisions with Ar$^{q+}$ projectiles ($4 \le q \le 16$, velocities $\approx 0.3$ a.u). Using the native-frames method, we disentangle the sequential and concerted break-up processes and their corresponding kinetic energy release (KER) distributions. \emph{Ab initio} potential energy curves of CO$_2^{3+}$ are calculated and mapped to the KER spectra to identify the underlying electronic states involved in the fragmentation. While the sequential KER distributions remain nearly unchanged for across the projectile charge range, the concerted KER distributions exhibit pronounced but non-systematic variations with projectile charge. In addition, a low KER feature around 15.5 eV -- previously associated with sequential break-up in electron and proton impact -- is observed for Ar$^{4+}$ impact and, to a lesser extent, for Ar$^{6+}$ impact. It originates predominantly from concerted break-up of the low-lying $^2\Pi_\text{g}$ and $^{2,4}\Pi_\text{u}$ states. Branching ratios of the two break-up pathways deviate from simple monotonic trends for certain projectiles, but barring these exceptions, the fraction of concerted break-up decreases with increasing $q$, while that for sequential break-up increases. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for the detailed electronic structure of the projectile, rather than its charge alone, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of collisional dynamics in slow, highly charged ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon Resonance Responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioresponsive optical materials that transduce nanoscale biointerface events into measurable spectral signals are of growing interest for sensing and antiviral technologies Here we show that a Tamm plasmon TP device consisting of a SiOTiO distributed Bragg reflector capped with a nanostructured silver layer exhibits a selective and structure dependent response to SARSCoV2 virus like particles VLPs Upon VLP exposure the conventional wavelength shift delta lambda of the TP resonance is minimal whereas the resonance depth undergoes a systematic attenuation To capture both spectral and amplitude variations we introduce a displacement angle alpha defined from the translation vector of the Tamm dip before and after exposure The angle alpha increases monotonically with VLP concentration and enables a limit of detection of 13 ng per mL Control experiments with polystyrene nanoparticles of similar size and with heat denatured VLPs yield negligible changes indicating sensitivity to the native conformational state of viral surface proteins rather than to generic nanoparticle morphology or bulk refractive index effects These results establish Tamm plasmon structures as promising bioresponsive platforms for label free detection and for probing structure dependent virus material interactions.</description>

      <title>Two Charging Mechanisms in Contact Electrification of Liquid and Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics for searching saddle points on general Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Computational Framework for Materials Design, Ab Initio Modeling, and Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To facilitate rational molecular and materials design, this research proposes an integrated computational framework that combines stochastic simulation, ab initio quantum chemistry, and molecular docking. The suggested workflow allows systematic investigation of structural stability, binding affinity, and electronic properties across biological and materials science domains by utilizing complementary tools like Avogadro for molecular construction and visualization, AutoDock for docking and interaction analysis, and ORCA for high-level electronic structure computations. Uncertainty, configurational sampling, and optimization in high-dimensional chemical spaces are addressed by combining Monte Carlo-based and annealing-inspired techniques. The work shows how materials science ideas such as polymer design, thin films, crystalline lattices, and bioelectronic systems can be applied to drug development. On-device, open-source computational methods are viable, scalable, and economical, as demonstrated by comparative platform analysis. All things considered, the findings highlight the need of an integrated, repeatable computational pipeline for speeding up de novo molecule assembly and materials architecture while lowering experimental risk and expense.</description>

      <title>Modelling Carbon Coated Silicon Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries and the Influence of Contact Area on Rate Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its exceptionally high specific capacity (3600 mAh g$^{-1}$), significantly exceeding that of conventional graphite. However, its practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion (300-400%) during lithiation, leading to mechanical degradation and capacity fade. A graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C, especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes. The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and efficient Si-based composite anodes.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reactivity for Capturing Brownian Motion by Partially Reactive Patches on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the trapping of diffusing ligands, modeled as Brownian particles, by a sphere that has $N$ partially reactive boundary patches, each of small area and arbitrary shape, on an otherwise reflecting boundary. For such a structured target, the partial reactivity of each boundary patch is characterized by a Robin boundary condition, with a local boundary reactivity $\kappa_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$. For any spatial arrangement of well-separated patches on the surface of the sphere, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to derive explicit results for the capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ of the structured target, which is valid for any $\kappa_i&gt;0$. This target capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ is defined in terms of a Green's matrix, which depends on the spatial configuration of patches, the local reactive capacitance $C_i(\kappa_i)$ of each patch and another coefficient that depends on the local geometry near a patch. The analytical dependence of $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$ on $\kappa_i$ is uncovered via a spectral expansion over Steklov eigenfunctions. For circular patches, the latter are readily computed numerically and provide an accurate fully explicit sigmoidal approximation for $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$. In the homogenization limit of $N\gg 1$ identical uniformly-spaced patches with $\kappa_i=\kappa$, we derive an explicit scaling law for the effective capacitance and the effective reactivity of the structured target that is valid in the limit of small patch area fraction. From a comparison with numerical simulations, we show that this scaling law provides a highly accurate approximation over the full range $\kappa&gt;0$, even when there is only a moderately large number of reactive patches.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>
