      <title>SeisBind: Physics-Aware Tri-Modal Representation Binding for Seismic Data via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a physics-aware multi-modal contrastive learning framework designed to transform complex seismic wavefields into human-readable physical representations. Traditional data-driven inversion methods often focus on pixel-wise mapping, which lacks physical grounding and interpretability. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that jointly aligns seismic shot gathers, subsurface velocity models, and explicit physical descriptors (e.g., mean velocity and gradients) in a shared latent space. By introducing these descriptors as a third modality, our approach encourages the learned embeddings to capture intrinsic geological semantics rather than superficial signal correlations. Experiments on the OpenFWI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves robust seismic-to-velocity retrieval but also preserves meaningful physical semantics, enabling cross-modal inference of interpretable attributes. This representation-centric perspective provides a flexible foundation for expert-guided subsurface characterization.</description>

      <title>Decameter-sized Earth Impactors -- II: A Bayesian Inference Approach to Meteoroid Ablation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.</description>

      <title>From Columns to Heaps: Dimensionless Similarity with PSD-Distributed Damk\"ohler Numbers and Dual-Porosity Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a unified, dimensionless framework for comparing geometrically similar reacting porous-flow systems across scale, with emphasis on hydrometallurgical heap leaching, when particle size distribution (PSD) and intraparticle pore structure differ. Under dynamic similarity, the dimensionless liquid residence-time distribution (RTD) is identical, but differences in PSD and internal porosity break microscopic similarity. Using the shrinking-core model (SCM), the analysis shows how a PSD in particle diameter maps to a distribution of particle-scale Damk\"ohler numbers that governs heap-averaged conversion.
  Explicit PSD to Damk\"ohler transformations are derived for (i) external film control, (ii) intraparticle diffusion control, and (iii) mixed control via additive rates. Dual-porosity hydrology relevant to sedimentary or strongly stratified ores is then incorporated by coupling SCM kinetics to mobile and immobile liquid domains, introducing additional dimensionless groups that describe interporosity exchange. Two numerical examples map a lognormal PSD into film- and diffusion-controlled Damk\"ohler distributions and compare column/heap conversion for different PSDs. A practical workflow is outlined for hydrometallurgical column-test interpretation, combining tracer RTD calibration with PSD-aware kinetic fitting in dimensionless time. The framework clarifies why diffusion-controlled leaching is far more sensitive to PSD tails and dual-porosity structure than film-controlled leaching, and it identifies the compact set of dimensionless groups that must be matched to ensure similarity between laboratory columns and industrial heaps.</description>

      <title>2.5D Transformer: An Efficient 3D Seismic Interpolation Method without Full 3D Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer has emerged as a powerful deep-learning technique for two-dimensional (2D) seismic data interpolation, owing to its global modeling ability. However, its core operation introduces heavy computational burden due to the quadratic complexity, hindering its further application to higher-dimensional data. To achieve Transformer-based three-dimensional (3D) seismic interpolation, we propose a 2.5-dimensional Transformer network (T-2.5D) that adopts a cross-dimensional transfer learning (TL) strategy, so as to adapt the 2D Transformer encoders to 3D seismic data. The proposed T-2.5D is mainly composed of 2D Transformer encoders and 3D seismic dimension adapters (SDAs). Each 3D SDA is placed before a Transformer encoder to learn spatial correlation information across seismic lines. The proposed cross-dimensional TL strategy comprises two stages: 2D pre-training and 3D fine-tuning. In the first stage, we optimize the 2D Transformer encoders using a large amount of 2D data patches. In the second stage, we freeze the 2D Transformer encoders and fine-tune the 3D SDAs using limited 3D data volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets are conducted to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of T-2.5D. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to that of full 3D Transformer at a significantly low cost.</description>

      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>
