      <title>Knobs and dials of retrieving JWST transmission spectra. II. Impacts of pipeline-level differences on retrieval posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have seen a revolution in data quality. Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.</description>

      <title>Why Estimating $\eta_\oplus$ is Difficult: A Kepler-Centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\eta_{\oplus}$, the occurrence rate of rocky habitable zone exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, is of great interest to both the astronomical community and the general public. The Kepler space telescope has made it possible to estimate $\eta_{\oplus}$, but estimates by different groups vary by more than an order of magnitude. We identify several causes for this range of estimates. We first review why, despite being designed to estimate $\eta_{\oplus}$, Kepler's observations are not sufficient for a high-confidence estimate, due to Kepler's detection limit coinciding with the $\eta_{\oplus}$ regime. This results in a need to infer $\eta_{\oplus}$, for example extrapolating from a regime of non-habitable zone, non-rocky exoplanets. We examine two broad classes of causes that can account for the large discrepancy in $\eta_\oplus$ found in the literature: a) differences in definitions and input data between studies, and b) fundamental limits in Kepler data that lead to large uncertainties and poor accuracy. We highlight the risk of large biases when using extrapolation to describe small exoplanet populations in the habitable zone. We discuss how $\eta_{\oplus}$ estimates based on Kepler data can be improved, such as reprocessing Kepler data for more complete, higher-reliability detections and better exoplanet catalog characterization. We briefly survey upcoming space telescopes capable of measuring $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how they can be used to supplement Kepler data.</description>

      <title>Are We There Yet? Challenges in Quantifying the Frequency of Earth Analogs in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for life elsewhere in the universe is one of the most highly prioritized pursuits in astronomy today. However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\eta_{\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\eta_{\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\eta_{\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\eta_{\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\eta_{\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>The Evolution in Coma Molecular Composition of Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) Across the H$_2$O Sublimation Zone: ALMA Imaging of an H$_2$O-Dominated Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a survey of molecular emission from cometary volatiles using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) carried out on UT 2022 September 21, 22, and 23 at a heliocentric distance (\rh{}) of 2.1 au. These measurements of HCN, CS, CO, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO (along with continuum emission from dust) sampled molecular chemistry in C/2017 K2 at the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone, discerning parent from daughter or extended source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule. CH$_3$OH, CO, and HCN were produced within $\sim$250 km of the nucleus, potentially including contributions from sublimation of icy grains. CS was consistent with production from CS$_2$ photolysis, and H$_2$CO required production from extended sources in the coma. An ortho-to-para ratio OPR=$2.9\pm0.4$ for H$_2$CO was derived from simultaneously measured transitions of each spin species. The continuum was extended and spatially resolved, consistent with thermal emission from dust in the coma. Analysis of the continuum visibilities provided an upper limit on the nucleus diameter $d&lt;6.6$ km and coma dust masses of $1.2-2.4\times10^{11}$ kg.</description>

      <title>Finite Lifetime Fragment Model 4 for Striae Formation in the Dust Tails of Comets (FLM 4) Acceleration by Lorenz-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striations in the dust tails of comets are referred to as striae, and their origin has long been a mystery. We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5 $\mu m$, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.</description>

      <title>Three New Light Curves and Updated Transit Timings of WASP-135 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated transit timing measurements for the hot Jupiter WASP-135 b using three new ground-based transit observations obtained with Leia, a 0.6-meter telescope operated by NASA's Exoplanet Watch at the Table Mountain Facility. These observations, conducted as part of Exoplanet Watch citizen science initiative, were analyzed with the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) pipeline to generate high-quality light curves and extract precise mid-transit times. By combining our new data with previously published observations, we refined the planet's ephemeris, reducing uncertainties in both the orbital period and mid-transit time. Our final mid-transit value is 2460585.6563426 +/- 0.00001908 BJD_TDB and the final period value is 1.4013776 +/- 0.0000002 days. Our updated timing solution demonstrates a 92% reduction in mid-transit time uncertainty compared to the original discovery paper and improves the precision of transit forecasts through 2030 which is critical to ensure efficient scheduling of future missions, such as ESA's Ariel. This work highlights the critical role of ongoing ground-based observations by students and citizen scientists in maintaining accurate ephemerides, which are essential for planning future space-based follow-up with facilities such as the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. The work in this paper was done as part of the SEDS-PH (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space-Philippines) Upskill Groups, which provides opportunities for Filipinos to participate in space-related projects.</description>

      <title>Dust distribution in circumstellar disks harboring multi-planet systems. I. Sub-thermal mass planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of dust gaps in circumstellar disks driven by the presence of multiple low-mass planets, focusing on the distinct physical mechanisms that operate across different gas-dust coupling regimes.
  We performed 2D hydrodynamical simulations of multiple planets embedded in a circumstellar disk using the PLUTO code, with the addition of dust treated as Lagrangian particles with a multi-size distribution. We carried out a large parameter space analysis to check the influence of disk and planetary properties on the dust component.
  Planets with $m \gtrsim 1 \, M_{\oplus}$ can open dust gaps for small grains in dense and warm disks (strong coupling) and for large grains in thin and cold disks (weak coupling), without significantly perturbing the gas. In the strong coupling regime, rapid Type I migration can shift the gap location inward or outward with respect to the planetary orbit, depending on the direction of migration. We also find dust gaps that overlap with Lindblad resonances. In the weak coupling regime, planets can create an inner dust cavity, multiple dust rings, or hide inside a common gap.
  Our results show how low-mass multi-planet systems perturb the dust distribution, which cannot be explained by considering each planet in isolation and has a crucial dependence on local disk conditions and dust grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Building Wet Planets through High-Pressure Magma-Hydrogen Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-in transiting sub-Neptunes are abundant in our galaxy \cite{fulton2017california}. Planetary interior models based on their observed radius-mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal \cite{bean2021nature}. Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inward to their present orbits \cite{bitsch2021Dry}. Here, we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that releases silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing a significant amount of water up to a few tens of weight percent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation \cite{misener2023Atmospheresa,schlichting2022Chemical}. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.</description>

      <title>The parametric oscillator model for the case of resonant argument circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to obtain an approximate solution of the restricted three-body problem in the case of small perturbations in the vicinity of, but not in exact resonance. In this paper, we study the restricted threebody problem known as planetary type (i.e., when the eccentricity of the test particle is small). A method of linearizing the equation of motion close to (but not in) resonance is proposed under the assumption of small perturbations. In other words, we study orbits when the resonant argument circles the resonance. In the practically interesting case of resonant perturbations we can restrict our study to a perturbation with a single frequency with the largest amplitude, and reduce the problem to the Mathieu equation. The model qualitatively describes the behavior of the perturbation in the vicinity of the resonance. It can be used to estimate the exact position of the resonance and the boundaries between neighboring resonances.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence for a possible link between PAH emission and dust trap locations in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are commonly detected in protoplanetary disks, but it is unclear what causes the wide range of intensities across the samples. In this work, the measured PAH intensities of a range of disks are compared with ALMA dust continuum images, in order to test whether there is evidence that PAHs are frozen out on pebbles in dust traps and only sublimate under certain conditions. A sample is constructed from 26 T Tauri and Herbig disks located within 300 pc, with constraints on the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH intensity and with high-resolution ALMA continuum data. The midplane temperature is derived using a power-law or with radiative transfer modeling. The warm dust mass is computed by integrating the flux within the 30 K radius and convert to a dust mass. A strong correlation with a Pearson coefficient of 0.88+/-0.07 between the 3.3 micron PAH intensity and the warm dust mass was found. The correlation is driven by the combination of deep upper limits and strong detections corresponding to a range of warm dust masses. Possible correlations with other disk properties like FUV radiation field or total dust mass are much weaker. Correlations with PAH features at 6.2, 8.6 and 11.3 micron are potentially weaker, but this could be explained by the smaller sample for which these data were available. The correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that PAHs are generally frozen out on pebbles in disks, and are only revealed in the gas phase if those pebbles have drifted towards warm dust traps inside the 30 K radius and vertically transported upwards to the disk atmosphere with sufficiently high temperature to sublimate PAHs into the gas phase. This is similar to previous findings on complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and provides further evidence that the chemical composition of the disk is governed by pebble transport.</description>

      <title>A Gas-Phase Kinetic Study of the N(2D) + CH3CCH and N(2D) + CH3CN Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemistry of planetary atmospheres containing molecular nitrogen as a major atmospheric component is strongly influenced by the reactions of atomic nitrogen. Although nitrogen atoms in their ground electronic state N(4S) are mostly unreactive towards stable molecules, electronically excited nitrogen atoms N(2D) are much more reactive and could play an important role in the formation of nitriles and other nitrogen bearing organic molecules in planetary atmospheres such as Titan. Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Masses. V. Weywot's Non-Keplerian Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed dynamical analysis of the Quaoar-Weywot system based on nearly 20 years of high-precision astrometric data, including new HST observations and stellar occultations. Our study reveals that Weywot's orbit deviates significantly from a purely Keplerian model, requiring the inclusion of Quaoar's non-spherical gravitational field and center-of-body-center-of-light (COB-COL) offsets in our orbit models. We place a robust upper limit on Weywot's orbital eccentricity ($e&lt;0.02$), substantially lower than previous estimates, which has important implications for the strength of mean motion resonances (MMRs) acting on Quaoar's ring system. Under the assumption that Quaoar's rings lie in its equatorial plane, we detect Quaoar's dynamical oblateness, $J_2$, at $\sim$2$\sigma$ confidence. The low $J_2$ value found under that assumption implies Quaoar is differentiated, with a total bulk density of $1751\pm13$ (stat.) kg m$^{-3}$. Additionally, we detect significant COB-COL offsets likely arising from latitudinal albedo variations across Quaoar's surface. These offsets are necessary to achieve a statistically robust orbit fit and highlight the importance of accounting for surface heterogeneity when modeling the orbits of dwarf planet moons. These findings improve our understanding of Quaoar's interior and surface while providing key insights into the stability and confinement mechanisms of its rings.</description>

      <title>Orbital Characterization of a Newly Discovered Small Satellite Around Quaoar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of a stellar occultation have revealed the presence of a previously undiscovered small satellite around Quaoar. Orbiting near Quaoar's unusual ring system, this new satellite has the potential to provide significant insights into the formation and evolution of Quaoar and its ring system. In this letter, we characterize the orbit of this newly discovered satellite, finding that it is likely on a $3.6^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$-day orbit, plausibly placing it near a 5:3 mean motion resonance with Quaoar's outermost known ring. Examining the possibility of observing the newly discovered satellite with further stellar occultations, we estimate that $\sim$hundreds of observing stations are required for recovery, since phase information about its orbit was rapidly lost after the lone detection. We also attempted to recover the satellite in JWST NIRCam imaging of Quaoar, but find no convincing detection. This non-detection is limited by the accuracy of the available NIRCam PSF models, as well as the satellite's extreme faintness and close-in orbital separation. Therefore, current-generation telescopes will likely struggle to directly image this new satellite, but near-future 30-meter-class telescopes should prove capable of detecting it. Discovery of such a satellite provides evidence that the rings around Quaoar may have been part of an initially broad collisional disk that has evolved considerably since its formation. To further explore this hypothesis, we encourage follow-up observations of the rings and satellites with stellar occultations and direct imaging, as well as updated hydrodynamical, collisional, and tidal modeling of the system.</description>

Abstract: The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Model for the Forced Libration of Icy Moons with Subsurface Oceans: Application to Enceladus and Mimas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a simple two-layered viscoelastic rheological model capable of replicating the forced librations of an icy moon with a subsurface ocean. We show that the model, composed only of a prestressed icy crust lying over an effective fluid core (a fixed mantle cavity), can effectively describe the librational behavior of icy moons, thus holding the potential to predict the presence of a subsurface ocean through the analysis of longitudinal librations. The proposed model is applied to the longitudinal librations of Enceladus and Mimas, two small icy moons of Saturn for which relevant data is available from the Cassini mission.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ringed versus Ringless Worlds: How Poynting-Robertson Drag Shapes Rings across the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary rings are not only ubiquitous around the giant planets in the outer Solar System, but have also been discovered around several small distant bodies. In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \(\,a_{\mathrm{pla}}\) and the particle radius \(\,r_{\mathrm{par}}\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \(\bigl(\tau_{\mathrm{decay}}\propto a_{\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \,r_{\mathrm{par}}\bigr)\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.</description>

      <title>Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme space weather events on Earth occur during intervals of strong solar wind driving. The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.</description>

      <title>What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

      <title>Coherent Differential Imaging of high-contrast extended sources with VLT/SPHERE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.</description>
