      <title>Cubiquitous Lattices and Branched Covers bounding rational balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greene and Owens explore cubiquitous lattices as an obstruction to rational homology 3-spheres bounding rational homology 4-balls. The purpose of this article is to better understand which sublattices of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ are cubiquitous with the aim of effectively using their cubiquity obstruction. We develop a geometric obstruction (called the Wu obstruction) to cubiquity and use it as tool to completely classify which sublattices with orthogonal bases are cubiquitous. We then apply this result the double branched covers of alternating connected sums of torus links. Finally, we explore how the Wu obstruction can be used in conjunction with contractions to obstruct the cubiquity of infinite families of lattices.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz rigidity of discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a bi-Lipschitz rigidity theorem for a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group. As an application, we show that any Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple algebraic group $G$ cannot have a $C^1$-smooth antipodal limit set in $G/P$ for any non-maximal parabolic subgroup $P$.</description>

      <title>Dips at small sizes for topological graph obstruction sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Graph Minor Theorem of Robertson and Seymour implies a finite set of obstructions for any minor closed graph property. We show that there are only three obstructions to knotless embedding of size 23, which is far fewer than the 92 of size 22 and the hundreds known to exist at larger sizes. We describe several other topological properties whose obstruction set demonstrates a similar dip at small size. For order ten graphs, we classify the 35 obstructions to knotless embedding and the 49 maximal knotless graphs.</description>

      <title>Growth of k-dimensional systoles in congruence coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study growth of absolute and homological $k$-dimensional systoles of arithmetic $n$-manifolds along congruence coverings. Our main interest is in the growth of systoles of manifolds whose real rank $r &gt; 1$. We observe, in particular, that in some cases for $k = r$ the growth function tends to oscillate between a power of a logarithm and a power function of the degree of the covering. This is a new phenomenon. We also prove the expected polylogarithmic and constant power bounds for small and large $k$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of fine curve graphs for nonorientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine curve graph of a surface was introduced by Bowden, Hensel, and Webb as a graph consisting of essential simple closed curves on the surface. Long, Margalit, Pham, Verberne, and Yao proved that the automorphism group of the fine curve graph of a closed orientable surface is isomorphic to the homeomorphism group of the surface. In this paper, based on their argument, we prove that the automorphism group of the fine curve graph of a closed nonorientable surface $N$ of genus $g \geq 4$ is isomorphic to the homeomorphism group of $N$.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Adequate Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a link is adequate if the breadth of its Jones polynomial equals the difference between its crossing number and its Turaev genus. Combining this result with its converse obtained by Abe [1, Theorem 3.2], we get a simple characterization of adequate links based on these numerical link invariants. As an application, we provide a simple obstruction for a link to be quasi-alternating. Moreover, we use this result to give a lower bound for the crossing number of some classes of links which would be very useful to determine the crossing number in certain cases.</description>

      <title>The Information Geometry of UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we highlight some connections of UMAP to the basic principles of Information Geometry. Originally, UMAP was derived from Category Theory observations. However, we posit that it also has a natural geometric interpretation.</description>
