      <title>Low regularity symplectic schemes for stochastic NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of symplectic resonance based schemes for Schr\"odinger's equation in dimension one, building on the work in [1] wherein resonance based numerical schemes were developed in the context of dispersive PDE driven by time dependent, or space-time dependent, coloured noise. We work primarily with a cubic nonlinearity, advancing the approach introduced in [15] for deriving symplectic schemes in the deterministic setting. As an example of such a scheme we derive the resonance based midpoint rule for the Stochastic NLS and analyse its convergence properties.</description>

      <title>On a fractional magnetic pseudorelativistic operator: properties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fractional magnetic pseudorelativistic operator for a general fractional order $s\in(0,1)$. First we define a suitable functional setting and we prove some fundamental properties. Then we show the behavior of the operator as $s \nearrow 1$ obtaining some results \`a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu and removing the singularity from the integral definition. Finally we get existence of weak solutions for some semilinear equations involving a power type nonlinearity or a nonlocal (Choquard type) term.</description>

      <title>On the Meissner state for type-II inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider extreme type-II superconductors modeled by the Ginzburg--Landau energy with a pinning term $a_\varepsilon(x)$, which we assume to be a bounded measurable function such that $b\leq a_\varepsilon(x)\leq 1$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. A crucial feature of this type of superconductors is the occurrence of vortices, which appear above the so-called first critical field $H_{c_1}$. In this paper we estimate this value and characterize the behavior of the Meissner solution, the unique vortexless configuration that globally minimizes the energy below $H_{c_1}$. In addition, we show that beyond this value, for applied fields whose strength is slightly below the so-called superheating field $H_{sh}$, there exists a unique Meissner-type solution that locally minimizes the energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exterior domain problem is essential in fluid and kinetic equations. In this paper, we establish the validity of the diffusive expansion for the Boltzmann equations to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system up to the critical time in an exterior domain with non-zero passing flow. We apply the $L^3-L^6$ framework to the unbounded domain in this paper.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectories and Spectral Boundary Conditions for Enhanced Diffusion in Immersed Boundary Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive framework for enhanced diffusion modeling in fluid-structure interactions by combining the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with stochastic trajectories and high-order spectral boundary conditions. Using semi-Lagrangian schemes, this approach captures complex diffusion dynamics at moving interfaces, integrating probabilistic methods that reflect multi-scale fluctuations. In addition to a rigorous mathematical foundation that includes stability proofs, this model exhibits reduced numerical diffusion errors and improved stability in long-term simulations. Comparative studies highlight its effectiveness in multi-scale scenarios that require precision in interface dynamics. Focusing on various shear and circular flows, including those with H\"older and Lipschitz regularities and critical points, we establish sharp bounds on effective diffusion rates using specific initial data examples. This dual exploration in enhanced diffusion highlights how flow regularity and critical points influence dissipation. These findings advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of enhanced diffusion in fluid dynamics, offering new insights into diffusion rate optimization through interface dynamics and flow structure regularities. Future research can further refine the IBM framework by exploring alternative probabilistic methods to improve interface accuracy, opening up the potential for improved modeling in applications that require precise control over mixing rates and dissipation processes.</description>

      <title>Concentration phenomena of positive solutions to weakly coupled Schr\"odinger systems with large exponents in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weakly coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u_1 = \mu_1 u_1^{p} +\beta u_1^{\frac{p-1}{2}} u_2^{\frac{p+1}{2}}\text{ in } \Omega,\\ -\Delta u_2 = \mu_2 u_2^{p} +\beta u_2^{\frac{p-1}{2}}u_1^{\frac{p+1}{2}} \text{ in } \Omega,\\ u_1,u_2&gt;0\quad\text{in }\;\Omega;\quad u_1=u_2=0 \quad\text { on } \;\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $p&gt;1, \mu_1, \mu_2, \beta&gt;0$ and $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Under the natural condition that holds automatically for all positive solutions in star-shaped domains \begin{align*}
  p\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u_{1,p}|^2+|\nabla u_{2,p}|^2 dx \leq C, \end{align*} we give a complete description of the concentration phenomena of positive solutions $(u_{1,p},u_{2,p})$ as $p\rightarrow+\infty$, including the $L^{\infty}$-norm quantization $\|u_{k,p}\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\to \sqrt{e}$ for $k=1,2$, the energy quantization $p\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u_{1,p}|^2+|\nabla u_{2,p}|^2dx\to 8n\pi e $ with $n\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, and so on. In particular, we show that the ``local mass'' contributed by each concentration point must be one of $\{(8\pi,8\pi), (8\pi,0),(0,8\pi)\}$.</description>

      <title>Influence of Lower-Order Terms on the Convergence Rates in Stochastic Homogenization of Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the convergence rates for the homogenization of elliptic equations with lower-order terms under the spectral gap assumption, in both bounded domains and the entire space. Our analysis demonstrates that lower-order terms significantly affect the convergence rate, particularly in the full space, where the rate changes from \(O(\epsilon)\) (observed without lower-order terms) to \(O(\epsilon^{d/({d+2})})\) due to their influence. In contrast, in bounded domains, the convergence rate remains \(O(\epsilon^{1/2})\), as boundary conditions exert a stronger influence than the lower-order terms. To manage the complexities introduced by lower-order terms, we developed a novel technique that localizes the analysis within small grids, enabling the application of the Poincar\'e inequality for effective estimates. This work builds upon existing frameworks, offering a refined approach to quantitative homogenization with lower-order terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ideally conducting, viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in two dimensions. Specifically, we study the nonlinear dynamics near a combination of Couette flow and a constant magnetic field in a periodic infinite channel. In contrast to the Navier-Stokes equations this system is shown to exhibit algebraic instability and large norm inflation of the magnetic current on non-perturbative time scales.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic behaviors of acoustic waves due to high-contrast material inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behaviors of time-harmonic acoustic waves generated by an incident wave illuminating inhomogeneous medium inclusions with high-contrast material parameters. We derive sharp asymptotic estimates and obtain several effective acoustic obstacle scattering models when the material parameters take extreme values. The results clarify the connection between inhomogeneous medium scattering and obstacle scattering for acoustic waves, providing a clear criterion for identifying the boundary conditions of acoustic obstacles in practice. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of the classical sound-hard and sound-soft obstacle scattering models. We demonstrate that a sound-hard obstacle can be viewed as an inhomogeneous medium inclusion with infinite mass density, while a sound-soft obstacle corresponds to an inclusion with zero mass density and zero bulk modulus. Second, we introduce two novel acoustic obstacle scattering models when the mass density of the inclusion degenerates to zero. These new models offer a fresh perspective on considering inhomogeneous medium inclusions with high-contrast material parameters.</description>

      <title>A threshold for higher-order asymptotic development of genuinely nonlocal phase transition energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher-order asymptotic development of a nonlocal phase transition energy in bounded domains and with prescribed external boundary conditions. The energy under consideration has fractional order $2s \in (0,1)$ and a first-order asymptotic development in the $\Gamma$-sense as described by the fractional perimeter functional.
  We prove that there is no meaningful second-order asymptotic expansion and, in fact, no asymptotic expansion of fractional order $\mu &gt; 2-2s$. In view of this range value for $\mu$, it would be interesting to develop a new asymptotic development for the $\Gamma$-convergence of our energy functional which takes into account fractional orders.
  The results obtained here are also valid in every space dimension and with mild assumptions on the exterior data.</description>

      <title>Unified a-priori estimates for minimizers under $p,q-$growth and exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22875v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose some general growth conditions on the function $% f=f\left( x,\xi \right) $, including the so-called natural growth, or polynomial, or $p,q-$growth conditions, or even exponential growth, in order to obtain that any local minimizer of the energy integral $\;\int_{\Omega }f\left( x,Du\right) dx\,$ is locally Lipschitz continuous in $\Omega $. In fact this is the fundamental step for further regularity: the local boundedness of the gradient of any Lipschitz continuous local minimizer a-posteriori makes irrelevant the behavior of the integrand $f\left( x,\xi \right) $ as $\left\vert \xi \right\vert \rightarrow +\infty $; i.e., the general growth conditions a posteriori are reduced to a standard growth, with the possibility to apply the classical regularity theory. In other words, we reduce some classes of \textit{non-uniform} elliptic variational problems to a context of uniform ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of irreversible chemical networks with boundary equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large time dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems modeling some irreversible reaction networks are investigated. Depending on initial masses, these networks possibly possess boundary equilibria, where some of the chemical concentrations are completely used up. In the absence of these equilibria, we show an explicit convergence to equilibrium by a modified entropy method, where it is shown that reactions in a measurable set with positive measure is sufficient to combine with diffusion and to drive the system towards equilibrium. When the boundary equilibria are present, we show that they are unstable (in Lyapunov sense) using some bootstrap instability technique from fluid mechanics, while the nonlinear stability of the positive equilibrium is proved by exploiting a spectral gap of the linearized operator and the uniform-in-time boundedness of solutions.</description>

      <title>Remarks on nonlinear dispersive PDEs with rough dispersion management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Cauchy problem for a class of dispersive PDEs where a rough time coefficient is present in front of the dispersion. Under minimal assumptions on the occupation measure of this coefficient, we show that for the large class of semilinear dispersive PDEs whose well-posedness theory relies on linear estimates of Strichartz or local smoothing type, one has the same well-posedness theory with or without the modulation. We also show a regularization by noise type of phenomenon for rough modulations, namely, large data global well-posedness in the focusing mass-critical case for the modulated equation. Under rougher assumptions on the modulation, we show that one can also transfer the well-posedness theory based on multilinear Fourier analysis from the original dispersive PDE to the modulated one. In the case of the NLS equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$, this covers all the sub-critical and critical regularities, thus completing and extending the various results currently available in the literature. At last, in the case of the periodic Wick-ordered cubic NLS, we show an even stronger form of regularization by noise, namely well-posedness in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space for rough modulations.</description>

      <title>Regularization by noise for some strongly non-resonant modulated dispersive PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we pursue our investigations on the Cauchy problem for a class of dispersive PDEs where a rough time coefficient is present in front of the dispersion. We show that if the PDE satisfies a strong non-resonance condition (Theorem 1.6), eventually up to a completely resonant term (Theorem 1.9), then the modulated PDE is well-posed at any regularity index provided that the noise term in front of the dispersion is irregular enough. This extends earlier pioneering work of Chouk-Gubinelli and Chouk-Gubinelli-Li-Li-Oh to a more general context. We quantify the irregularity of the noise required to reach a given regularity index in terms of the regularity of its occupation measure in the sense of Catellier-Gubinelli. As examples, we discuss the cases of dispersive perturbations of the Burger's equation, including the dispersion-generalized Korteweg-de Vries and Benjamin-Ono equations, the intermediate long wave equation, the Wick-ordered modified dispersion-generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation. We also treat the completely non-resonant nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the Wick-ordered fractional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, all with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for doubly degenerate parabolic equations with weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem in the Euclidean space for a doubly degenerate parabolic equation with a space-dependent exponential weight, roughly speaking of the type of the exponential of a power of the distance from the origin. We assume here the solutions of the Cauchy problem to be globally integrable in space (in the appropriate weighted sense) and non-negative. Under suitable assumptions, we prove for the solutions sup estimates, i.e., the decay rate at infinity, the property of finite speed of propagation and support estimates. All our estimates are given explicitly in terms of the weight appearing in the equation.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-Explicit Well-Posedness of Bayesian Shape Inversion in Acoustic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Bayesian approach to the inverse problem of recovering the shape of an object from measurements of its scattered acoustic field. Working in the time-harmonic setting, we focus on a Helmholtz transmission problem and then extend our results to an exterior Dirichlet problem. We assume the scatterer to be star-shaped and we use, as prior, a truncated expansion with uniform random variables for a radial parametrization of the scatterer's boundary. The main novelty of our work is that we establish the well-posedness of the Bayesian shape inverse problem in a wavenumber-explicit way, under some conditions on the material parameters excluding quasi-resonant regimes. Our estimates highlight how the stability of the posterior with respect to the data is affected by the wavenumber (or, in other words, the frequency), whose magnitude has to be understood not in absolute terms but in relationship to the spatial scale of the problem.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of hyperbolic Busemann functions in the Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the N-body problem we prove that any two hyperbolic rays having the same limit shape define the same Busemann function. We localize a region of differentiability for these functions, of which we know that they are viscosity solutions of the stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As a first corollary, we deduce that every hyperbolic motion of the $N$-body problem must become, after some time, a calibrating curve for the Busemann function associated to its limit shape. This implies that every hyperbolic motionof the $N$-body problem is eventually a minimizer, that is, it must contain a geodesic ray of the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric. Since the viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are almost everywhere differentiable, we also deduce the generic uniqueness of geodesic rays with a given limit shape without collisions. That is to say, if the limit shape is given, then for almost every initial configuration the geodesic ray is unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study a Laplace-type operator and its fundamental solution on the characteristic plane in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^2$. We introduce a conformal version of the Laplacian and we prove that the distance induced by the immersion in the ambient space is a good approximation of its fundamental solution. We provide in particular a representation formula for smooth functions in terms of the gradient of the function and the gradient of the approximated fundamental solution. This representation formula in the plane is stable up to its characteristic point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caffarelli-Hardt-Simon used the minimal surface equation on the Simons cone $C(S^3\times S^3)$ to generate newer examples of minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities. Hardt-Simon proved that every area-minimizing quadratic cone $\mathcal{C}$ having only an isolated singularity can be approximated by a unique foliation of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ by smooth, area-minimizing hypersurfaces asymptotic to $\mathcal C$. This paper uses methods similar to Caffareli-Hardt-Simon to solve the minimal surface equation for the Hardt-Simon surfaces in the sphere for some boundary values. We use gluing methods to construct minimal surfaces over Hardt-Simon surfaces and near quadratic cones.</description>

      <title>Emergence of meta-stable clustering in mean-field transformer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the evolution of tokens within a deep stack of Transformer layers as a continuous-time flow on the unit sphere, governed by a mean-field interacting particle system, building on the framework introduced in (Geshkovski et al., 2023). Studying the corresponding mean-field Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow, in this paper we provide a mathematical investigation of the long-term behavior of this system, with a particular focus on the emergence and persistence of meta-stable phases and clustering phenomena, key elements in applications like next-token prediction. More specifically, we perform a perturbative analysis of the mean-field PDE around the iid uniform initialization and prove that, in the limit of large number of tokens, the model remains close to a meta-stable manifold of solutions with a given structure (e.g., periodicity). Further, the structure characterizing the meta-stable manifold is explicitly identified, as a function of the inverse temperature parameter of the model, by the index maximizing a certain rescaling of Gegenbauer polynomials.</description>

      <title>Global Kato smoothing and Strichartz estimates for higher-order Schr\"odinger operators with rough decay potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \( H = (-\Delta)^m + V \) be a higher-order elliptic operator on \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \), where \( V \) is a general bounded decaying potential. This paper focuses on the global Kato smoothing and Strichartz estimates for solutions to Schr\"odinger-type equation associated with \( H \). In particular, we first establish sharp global Kato smoothing estimates for \( e^{itH} \), based on uniform resolvent estimates of Kato-Yajima type for the absolutely continuous part of \( H \). As a consequence, we also obtain optimal local decay estimates. Using these local decay estimates, we then prove the full set of Strichartz estimates, including the endpoint case. Notably, we derive Strichartz estimates with sharp smoothing effects for higher-order cases with rough potentials, which are applicable to the study of nonlinear higher-order Schr\"odinger equations. Finally, we introduce new uniform Sobolev estimates of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge type, incorporating an additional derivative term, which are crucial for establishing the sharp Kato smoothing estimates.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of nonlinear damped wave equations indexed by a parameter $\epsilon &gt;0$ and forced by a space-time white noise on the two dimensional torus, with polynomial and sine nonlinearities. We show that as $\epsilon \to 0$, the solutions to these equations converge to the solution of the corresponding two dimensional stochastic quantization equation. In the sine nonlinearity case, the convergence is proven over arbitrary large times, while in the polynomial case, we prove that this approximation result holds over arbitrary large times when the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero even with a lack of suitable global well-posedness theory for the corresponding wave equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degenerate linear Boltzmann equation inside a bounded domain with the Maxwell and the Cercignani-Lampis boundary conditions, two generalizations of the diffuse reflection, with variable temperature. Our abstract collisional setting includes the relaxation towards a space-dependent steady state, and the case where the collision kernel has heavy tails. For both boundary conditions, we prove for the first time the existence of a steady state and a rate of convergence towards it without assumptions on the temperature variations. Our results for the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition make also no hypotheses on the accommodation coefficients. The proven rate is exponential when a control condition on the degeneracy of the collision operator is satisfied, and only polynomial when this assumption is not met, in line with our previous results regarding the free-transport equation. We also provide a precise description of the different convergence rates, including lower bounds, when the steady state is bounded. Our method yields constructive constants.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, then it was recently shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not if $3 \le p \le \infty$. In the third kind resonance case, we also show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generically unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. Moreover, it is also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has the zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonances and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \R^3$.
  These results describe precisely the validity of the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold with some exceptions for the endpoint cases $p=1,\infty$. As an application, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are also derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <title>Justification of the Benjamin-Ono equation as an internal water waves model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the first rigorous justification of the Benjamin-Ono equation as an internal water wave model on the physical time scale. Let $\varepsilon$ be the small parameter measuring the weak nonlinearity of the waves, $\mu$ be the shallowness parameter, and $\gamma\in (0,1)$ is the ratio between the densities of the two fluids. To be precise, we first prove the existence of a solution to the internal water wave equations for a two-layer fluid with surface tension, where one layer is of shallow depth and the other is of infinite depth. The existence time is of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ for a small amount of surface tension such that $\varepsilon^2 \leq\mathrm{bo}^{-1} $ where $\mathrm{bo}$ is the Bond number. Then, we show that these solutions are close, on the same time scale, to the solutions of the BO equation with a precision of order $\mathcal{O}(\mu + \mathrm{bo}^{-1})$. In addition, we provide the justification of new equations with improved dispersive properties, the Benjamin equation, and the Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation in the deep-water limit.
  The long-time well-posedness of the two-layer fluid problem was first studied by Lannes [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 208(2):481-567, 2013] in the case where both fluids have finite depth. Here, we adapt this work to the case where one of the fluid domains is of finite depth, and the other one is of infinite depth. The novelties of the proof are related to the geometry of the problem, where the difference in domains alters the functional setting for the Dirichlet-Neumann operators involved. In particular, we study the various compositions of these operators that require a refined symbolic analysis of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator on infinite depth and derive new pseudo-differential estimates that might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves the local-in-time strong well-posedness of a parabolic-hyperbolic regularized version of Hibler's sea ice model. Hibler's model is the most frequently used sea ice model in climate science. Lagrangian coordinates are employed to handle the hyperbolic terms in the balance laws. The resulting problem is regarded as a quasilinear non-autonomous evolution equation. Maximal $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity of the underlying linearized problem is obtained on an anisotropic ground space in order to deal with the lack of regularization in the balance laws.</description>

      <title>Quantitative pointwise estimates of the cooling process for inelastic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for hard spheres. We first prove that the solution $f(t,v)$ is bounded pointwise from above by \(C_{f_0}\langle t \rangle^3\) and establish that the cooling time is infinite (\( T_c = +\infty \)) under the condition \( f_0 \in L^1_2 \cap L^{\infty}_{s} \) for \( s &gt; 2 \). Away from zero velocity, we further prove that $ f(t,v)\leq C_{f_0, |v|} \langle t \rangle $ for \(v \neq 0\) at any time \( t &gt; 0 \). This time-dependent pointwise upper bound is natural in the cooling process, as we expect the density near \( v = 0 \) to grow rapidly. We also establish an upper bound that depends on the coefficient of normal restitution constant, $\alpha \in (0,1]$. This upper bound becomes constant when $\alpha = 1$, restoring the known upper bound for elastic collisions \cite{L1983}. Consequently, through these results, we obtain Maxwellian upper bounds on the solutions at each time.</description>

Abstract: We consider vector valued weak solutions $u:\Omega_T\to \mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\in \mathbb{N}$ of degenerate or singular parabolic systems of type \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u - \mathrm{div} \, a(z,u,Du) = 0 \qquad\text{in}\qquad \Omega_T= \Omega\times (0,T), \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ denotes an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 1$ and $T&gt;0$ a finite time. Assuming that the vector field $a$ is not of Uhlenbeck-type structure, satisfies $p$-growth assumptions and $(z,u)\mapsto a(z,u,\xi)$ is H\"older continuous for every $\xi\in \mathbb{R}^{Nn}$, we show that the gradient $Du$ is partially H\"older continuous, provided the vector field degenerates like that of the $p$-Laplacian for small gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model previously introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.
  The question is studied as to whether for images related by a linear mapping the unique minimizer is given by that linear mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of linearly related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimizers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of linearly related images.</description>

Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>
