      <title>Probing the eccentricity in protostellar discs -- Modeling kinematics and morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protostellar discs are mostly modelled as circular structures of gas and dust orbiting a protostar. However, a number of physical mechanisms, e.g. the presence of a (sub)stellar companion or initial axial asymmetry, can cause the gas and dust orbital motion to become eccentric. Theoretical studies have revealed that, when present, disc eccentricity is expected to occur with predictable profiles that can be long-lasting and potentially observable in protostellar systems. We construct an analytical model predicting the typical features of the kinematics and morphology of eccentric protostellar discs, with the final goal of characterising the observational appearance of eccentricity in discs. We validate the model using a numerical simulation of a circumbinary disc (where the binary makes the disc eccentric). We finally post-process the simulation with Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer to study how eccentric features would appear through the "eyes" of ALMA. Besides the motion of the material on eccentric Keplerian orbits in the disc orbital plane, the most characteristic eccentric feature emerging from the analytical model is strong vertical motion with a typical anti-symmetric pattern (with respect to the disc line of pericentres). A circumbinary disc with a $\approx 40$ au eccentric cavity ($e_{\rm cav}=0.2$), carved by an $a_{\rm bin}=15$ au binary, placed at a distance $d=130$ pc, is expected to host in its upper emission surface vertical oscillations up to $v_{z}\sim 400\, {\rm ms}^{-1}$ close to the cavity edge, i.e. well within ALMA spectral and spatial resolution capabilities. A residual spiral pattern in the vertical velocity $\Delta v_{z}\sim 150\, {\rm ms}^{-1}$ of the simulation cannot be captured by the theoretical model, we speculate it to be possibly linked to the presence of a companion in the system.</description>

      <title>Orbital obliquity of the young planet TOI-5398 b and the evolutionary history of the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-planet systems exhibit remarkable architectural diversity. However, short-period giant planets are typically isolated. Compact systems like TOI-5398, with an outer close-orbit giant and an inner small-size planet, are rare among systems containing short-period giants. TOI-5398's unusual architecture coupled with its young age (650 $\pm$ 150 Myr) make it a promising system for measuring the original obliquity between the orbital axis of the giant and the stellar spin axis in order to gain insight into its formation and orbital migration. We collected in-transit (plus suitable off-transit) observations of TOI-5398 b with HARPS-N at TNG on March 25, 2023, obtaining high-precision radial velocity time series that allowed us to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. By modelling the RM effect, we obtained a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = 3.0^{+6.8}_{-4.2}$ deg for TOI-5398 b, consistent with the planet being aligned. With knowledge of the stellar rotation period, we estimated the true 3D obliquity, finding $\psi = (13.2\pm8.2)$ deg. Based on theoretical considerations, the orientation we measure is unaffected by tidal effects, offering a direct diagnostic for understanding the formation path of this planetary system. The orbital characteristics of TOI-5398, with its compact architecture, eccentricity consistent with circular orbits, and hints of orbital alignment, appear more compatible with the disc-driven migration scenario. TOI-5398, with its relative youth (compared with similar compact systems) and exceptional suitability for transmission spectroscopy studies, presents an outstanding opportunity to establish a benchmark for exploring the disc-driven migration model.</description>

      <title>NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b: An 1 Gyr old 98-day transiting warm Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period transiting exoplanets bridge the gap between the bulk of transit- and Doppler-based exoplanet discoveries, providing key insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The wider separation between these planets and their host stars results in the exoplanets typically experiencing less radiation from their host stars; hence, they should maintain more of their original atmospheres, which can be probed during transit via transmission spectroscopy. Although the known population of long-period transiting exoplanets is relatively sparse, surveys performed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) are now discovering new exoplanets to fill in this crucial region of the exoplanetary parameter space. This study presents the detection and characterisation of NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b, a new long-period transiting exoplanet detected by following up on a single-transit candidate found in the TESS mission. Through monitoring using a combination of photometric instruments (TESS, NGTS, and EulerCam) and spectroscopic instruments (CORALIE, FEROS, HARPS, and PFS), NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b was found to be a long-period (P = 98.29838 day) Jupiter-sized (0.928 RJ; 0.960 MJ) planet transiting a 1.1 Gyr old G-type star. With a moderate eccentricity of 0.294, its equilibrium temperature could be expected to vary from 274 K to 500 K over the course of its orbit. Through interior modelling, NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b was found to have a heavy element mass fraction of 0.23 and a heavy element enrichment (Zp/Z_star) of 20, making it metal-enriched compared to its host star. NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b is one of the youngest well-characterised long-period exoplanets found to date and will therefore be important in the quest to understanding the formation and evolution of exoplanets across the full range of orbital separations and ages.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Extended H$_{2}$O Cross-Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres: Implications for Spectral Characterization of Habitable Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has created a new era of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric characterization, and with it the possibility to detect potential biosignature gases like CH$_{4}$. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input modeling data. Molecular cross-sections are essential inputs to these models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross-sections of key molecules. H$_{2}$O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H$_{2}$O produces OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We investigate the photochemical effects of improved H$_{2}$O cross-sections on anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type (FGKM) and CH$_{4}$ surface flux. Our results show that updated H$_{2}$O cross-sections, extended to wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm, substantially impact the predicted abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing changes of up to three orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an order of magnitude in surface CH$_{4}$ levels. These differences lead to observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less affected. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for refined dissociation cross-section data for H$_{2}$O, where uncertainties remain, and other key molecules, especially at mid-UV wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. XXX: Characterization of the low-density gas giant HAT-P-67 b with GIARPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HAT-P-67 b is one of the lowest-density gas giants known to date, making it an excellent target for atmospheric characterization through the transmission spectroscopy technique. In the framework of the GAPS large programme, we collected four transit events, with the aim of studying the exoplanet atmosphere and deriving the orbital projected obliquity. We exploited the high-precision GIARPS observing mode of the TNG, along with additional archival TESS photometry, to explore the activity level of the host star. We performed transmission spectroscopy, both in the VIS and in the nIR wavelength range, and analysed the RML effect both fitting the RVs and the Doppler shadow. Based on the TESS photometry, we redetermined the transit parameters of HAT-P-67 b. By modelling the RML effect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of ($2.2\pm0.4$){\deg} indicating an aligned planetary orbit. The chromospheric activity index $\log\,R^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$, the CCF profile, and the variability in the transmission spectrum of the H$\alpha$ line suggest that the host star shows signatures of stellar activity and/or pulsations. We found no evidence of atomic or molecular species in the VIS transmission spectra, with the exception of pseudo-signals corresponding to Cr I, Fe I, H$\alpha$, Na I, and Ti I. In the nIR range, we found an absorption signal of the He I triplet of 5.56$^{+0.29}_{-0.30}$%(19.0$\sigma$), corresponding to an effective planetary radius of $\sim$3$R_p$ (where $R_p\sim$2$R_J$) which extends beyond the planet's Roche Lobe radius. Owing to the stellar variability, together with the high uncertainty of the model, we could not confirm the planetary origin of the signals found in the optical transmission spectrum. On the other hand, we confirmed previous detections of the infrared He I triplet, providing a 19.0$\sigma$ detection. Our finding indicates that the planet's atmosphere is evaporating.</description>

      <title>The Impact-driven Atmospheric Loss of Super-Earths around Different Spectral Type Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planet's mass loss is important for the planet's formation and evolution. The radius valley (RV) is believed to be triggered by evaporation-induced mass loss. As an alternative mechanism for the RV, the mass loss of post-impact planets is thoroughly investigated in this work. The impact energy is converted to the planet's internal energy, enhancing its core energy and accelerating mass loss and orbital migration. As the host star changes from K-type to F-type, the planet's mass loss and orbital migration increase. When the initial gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) is small, the migration efficiency for planets around K-type stars will increase, which helps to suppress mass loss and retain the planet's mass and radius within a specific range. On the contrary, planets around more massive F-type stars experience more substantial mass loss, potentially leading to complete mass loss, and migrate to orbits with longer periods. Our calculation shows that planets around different spectral types of host stars give rise to an RV ranging from 1.3-2.0 $R_{\oplus}$, consistent with the observed range of 1.3-2.6 $R_{\oplus}$. Despite the presence of uncertain parameters, the planetesimal impact can promote the RV establishment for planets around host stars of different spectral types.</description>

      <title>Report of the Working Group on Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This STScI Working Group (WG) was charged with soliciting community feedback and evaluating the strategic planning for exoplanet science with JWST and HST given the high quality of exoplanet observations, the significantly lengthened mission lifetime for JWST, and the pronounced expansion of the field over the last decade. We were charged with identifying key science themes, providing recommendations on issues associated with optimal timing and scale of resources, as well as providing a recommended DDT concept achievable with 500 hours of JWST time. We recommend a DDT concept to survey the atmospheres of rocky-M dwarf exoplanets. It is critical to quickly survey a wide sample of such targets to ascertain if they indeed host significant atmospheres, i.e., define the cosmic shoreline, and to identify high priority targets for future follow-up. It is important for this effort to occur early in the mission lifetime. In the context of strategic planning of exoplanet observations, it is useful to estimate the expected exoplanet observational commitment over JWST's lifetime. Given the current usage associated with exoplanets, extended over 20 cycles, it is anticipated that JWST will dedicate $\approx$30,000 hours to exoplanet observations. We recommend efforts to support GO-driven programs that will contribute to this unprecedented data product of JWST. Of the $\approx$30,000 hours of anticipated JWST full-mission time dedicated to exoplanets, we expect that 1/3 of it could, and perhaps inevitably would, form a comprehensive, high S/N, panchromatic, 10$^4$ hour atmospheric survey of planets. Such an observational sample would be a legacy archive that would address a broad range of science questions across various populations of planets. It would also bridge the direct imaging and transit communities and involve a multitude of techniques to detect and characterize exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrievals with petitRADTRANS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: petitRADTRANS (pRT) is a fast radiative transfer code used for computing emission and transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, combining a FORTRAN back end with a Python based user interface. It is widely used in the exoplanet community with 222 references in the literature to date, and has been benchmarked against numerous similar tools. The spectra calculated with pRT can be used as a forward model for fitting spectroscopic data using Monte Carlo techniques, commonly referred to as an atmospheric retrieval. The new retrieval module combines fast forward modelling with nested sampling codes, allowing for atmospheric retrievals on a large range of different types of exoplanet data. Thus it is now possible to use pRT to easily and quickly infer the atmospheric properties of exoplanets in both transmission and thermal emission.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG: LIV. A HeI survey of close-in giant planets hosted by M-K dwarf stars with GIANO-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape plays a fundamental role in shaping the properties of exoplanets. The metastable near-infrared helium triplet at 1083.3 nm (HeI) is a powerful proxy of extended and evaporating atmospheres. We used the GIARPS (GIANO-B+HARPS-N) observing mode of the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo to search for HeI absorption in the upper atmosphere of five close-in giant planets hosted by the K and M dwarf stars of our sample, namely WASP-69b, WASP-107b, HAT-P-11b, GJ436b, and GJ3470b. We focused our analysis on the HeI triplet by performing high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. When nightly variability in the HeI absorption signal was identified, we investigated the potential influence of stellar magnetic activity by searching for variations in the H$\alpha$. We spectrally resolve the HeI triplet and confirm the published detections for WASP-69b (3.91$\pm$0.22%, 17.6$\sigma$), WASP-107b (8.17$^{+0.80}_{-0.76}$%, 10.5$\sigma$), HAT-P-11b (1.36$\pm$0.17%, 8.0$\sigma$), and GJ3470b (1.75$^{+0.39}_{-0.36}$%, 4.7$\sigma$). We do not find evidence of extra absorption for GJ436b. We observe night-to-night variations in the HeI absorption signal for WASP-69b, associated with variability in H$\alpha$, which likely indicates the influence of stellar activity. Additionally, we find that the HeI signal of GJ3470b originates from a single transit, thereby corroborating the discrepancies in the existing literature. An inspection of the H$\alpha$ reveals an absorption signal during the same transit. By combining our findings with previous analyses of GIANO-B HeI measurements of planets around K dwarfs, we explore potential trends with planetary/stellar parameters that are thought to affect the HeI absorption. Our analysis is unable to identify clear patterns, emphasising the need for further measurements and the exploration of additional potential parameters that might influence HeI absorption.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>

      <title>Using JWST transits and occultations to determine $\sim1\%$ stellar radii and temperatures of low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using JWST observations of a primary transit and two secondary eclipses for GJ 1214b, we determine an eccentricity that is more precise than a decade of HARPS data, which enables us to measure the stellar density to 2.62%. Coupled with a prior on the stellar mass from a dynamically calibrated K-$M_*$ relation, we determine $R_*$ to 1.13% -- 3 times more precise than any other published analysis of this system. Then, using the bolometric flux from an spectral energy distribution model, we determine $T_{\rm eff}$ to 1.39% -- 40% more precise than systematic floors from spectroscopy. Within the global model, these also improve the planetary radius and insolation. This is a proof of concept for a new method to determine accurate $R_*$ and $T_{\rm eff}$ to a precision currently achieved for only a small number of low-mass stars. By applying our method to all high signal-to-noise ratio planetary transits and occultations, we can expand the sample of precisely measured stars without assuming tidal circularization and calibrate new relations to improve our understanding of all low-mass stars.</description>
