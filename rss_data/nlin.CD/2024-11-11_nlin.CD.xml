      <title>Suppressing parametric resonance of a Hyperloop vehicle using a parametric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of a simple model of a Hyperloop vehicle resulting from the interaction between electromagnetic and aeroelastic forces for both constant and periodically varying coefficients (i.e., parametric excitation). For the constant coefficients, through linear stability analysis, we analytically identify three distinct regions for the physically significant equilibrium point. Further inspection reveals that the system exhibits limit-cycle vibrations in one of these regions. Using the harmonic balance method, we determine the properties of the limit cycle, thereby unravelling the frequency and amplitude that characterize the periodic oscillations of the system's variables. For the varying coefficients case, the stability is studied using Floquet analysis and Hills determinant method. The part of the stability boundary related to parametric resonance has an elliptical shape, while the remaining part remains unchanged. One of the major findings is that a linear parametric force, can suppress or amplify the parametric resonance induced by another parametric force depending on the amplitude of the former. In the context of the Hyperloop system, this means that parametric resonance caused by base excitation-in other words by the linearized parametric electromagnetic force can be suppressed by modulating the coefficient of the aeroelastic force in the same frequency. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the phase difference between the modulation and the base excitation. The origin of the suppression is attributed to the stabilizing character of the parametric aeroelastic force as revealed through energy analysis. We provide analytical expressions for the stability boundaries and for the stability's dependence on the phase shift of the modulation.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Geometric Partition Entropy for the Estimation of Mutual Information in the Presence of Informative Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new viewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the impacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to the context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of geometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded (finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition invokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and reliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct theoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of approximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current methods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\pi$) approximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in any context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information estimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory allows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation of outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability of established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative outliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the synchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.</description>
