      <title>Ionization potential depression and Fermi barrier in warm dense matter--a first--principles approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization potential depression (IPD) is of crucial importance to understand and accurately predict the properties of dense partially ionized plasmas. Many models of IPD have been developed that, however, exhibit largely varying results. Recently, a novel approach was proposed that is based on first-principles quantum Monte Carlo simulations and that was demonstrated for hydrogen [Bonitz \textit{et al.}, Phys. Plasmas (2024)]. Here this concept is discussed in more detail. Particular attention is devoted to the Fermi barrier that electrons have to overcome upon ionization and which significantly contributes to IPD when the nuclear charge increases.</description>

      <title>Comparison between electrostatic PP and PIC simulations on electron bunch expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the great development of parallel computing techniques, the particle-particle (PP) model has been successfully applied in a number of plasma applications. Comparing to particle-mesh (PM) models, for example the widely used particle-in-cell (PIC) method, PP has the advantages of high accuracy in solving Coulomb interactions. In this paper, it is shown that PP is also advantageous to simulate non-neutral plasmas, such as electron bunch expansion in vacuum. The numerical effects of the macro-particle weight and the time step length are investigated for a PP model, accurate and convergent results can be obtained with less effort. On the contrary, PIC needs to simulate the same problem with extremely large effort. It is found that the simulation accuracy does not grow with reduced cell size monotonously, thus no convergence can be easily obtained. In the long run, PIC must apply large enough domain to cover all the expanding particles and avoid non-physical effects caused by imperfect infinite boundary condition, which may result in too heavy computation and make PIC infeasible.</description>

      <title>Multiscale autonomous forecasting of plasma systems' dynamics using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma systems exhibit complex multiscale dynamics, resolving which poses significant challenges for conventional numerical simulations. Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative by learning data-driven representations of these dynamics. Yet existing ML time-stepping models suffer from error accumulation, instability, and limited long-term forecasting horizons. This paper demonstrates the application of a hierarchical multiscale neural network architecture for autonomous plasma forecasting. The framework integrates multiple neural networks trained across different temporal scales to capture both fine-scale and large-scale behaviors while mitigating compounding error in recursive evaluation. Fine-scale networks accurately resolve fast-evolving features, while coarse-scale networks provide broader temporal context, reducing the frequency of recursive updates and limiting the accumulation of small prediction errors over time. We first evaluate the method using canonical nonlinear dynamical systems and compare its performance against classical single-scale neural networks. The results demonstrate that single-scale neural networks experience rapid divergence due to recursive error accumulation, whereas the multiscale approach improves stability and extends prediction horizons. Next, our ML model is applied to two plasma configurations of high scientific and applied significance, demonstrating its ability to preserve spatial structures and capture multiscale plasma dynamics. By leveraging multiple time-stepping resolutions, the applied framework is shown to outperform conventional single-scale networks for the studied plasma test cases. The results of this work position the hierarchical multiscale neural network as a promising tool for efficient plasma forecasting and digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>An analysis of debris-induced nonlinear phenomena in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an analysis of nonlinear waves and phenomena induced by an external charged debris in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma is presented. The process of formation of different nonlinear structures is examined theoretically through a forced Koretweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation, which is also verified with a multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) simulation. The different processes which are responsible for different nonlinear structures excited by differently charged external debris are pointed out. This work also tries to point out the similarities in different nonlinear structures by an external charged debris (this work) and the underlying processes and those produced by a positive ion beam (other works) in a PINI plasma through beam-plasma interaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives a summary of a talk by the author at the mini-conference entitled Progress in Making IFE-based Concepts a Reality at the APS-DPP meeting in Atlanta in October, 2024. It argues principally for a new DoE lab to examine the potential opportunity of laser fusion for civilian energy, by direct drive, with an excimer laser. This work is motivated mostly by the demonstration of a burning plasma in an indirect drive configuration, by the Lawrence Livermore National laboratory with its NIF laser. Also, it briefly gives some impressions of the mini conference.</description>

      <title>How does ion temperature gradient turbulence depend on magnetic geometry? Insights from data and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the level of turbulent transport in fusion plasmas. Here, we model and analyze this dependence using multiple machine learning methods and a dataset of &gt; 200,000 nonlinear simulations of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence in diverse non-axisymmetric geometries. The dataset is generated using a large collection of both optimized and randomly generated stellarator equilibria. At fixed gradients, the turbulent heat flux varies between geometries by several orders of magnitude. Trends are apparent among the configurations with particularly high or low heat flux. Regression and classification techniques from machine learning are then applied to extract patterns in the dataset. Due to a symmetry of the gyrokinetic equation, the heat flux and regressions thereof should be invariant to translations of the raw features in the parallel coordinate, similar to translation invariance in computer vision applications. Multiple regression models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees can achieve reasonable predictive power for the heat flux in held-out test configurations, with highest accuracy for the CNNs. Using Spearman correlation, sequential feature selection, and Shapley values to measure feature importance, it is consistently found that the most important geometric lever on the heat flux is the flux surface compression in regions of bad curvature. The second most important feature relates to the magnitude of geodesic curvature. These two features align remarkably with surrogates that have been proposed based on theory, while the methods here allow a natural extension to more features for increased accuracy. The dataset, released with this publication, may also be used to test other proposed surrogates, and we find many previously published proxies do correlate well with both the heat flux and stability boundary.</description>

      <title>The Brillouin flow in a smooth-bore magnetron fed by split cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive emission from an axial cathode of a relativistic magnetron produces plasma, the radial expansion of which can cause pulse shortening. In a split cathode fed magnetron, the electron source and its explosive plasma are outside the space where the high power microwave producing interaction occurs. This electron source is a longitudinal annular electron column expanding radially. This expansion simulates the radial emission from an axial cathode. A mathematical model and numerical simulations are presented which enable to calculate the parameters of this electron column, its density, angular velocity, and potential distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation in the solar corona and solar wind: A comparative analysis of radio-occultation observations and magnetohydrodynamic simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent in-situ observations and numerical models indicated various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves contributing to the solar wind acceleration. Among them is an MHD wave decomposition at distances closer than 50 $R_{\odot}$ using data taken by the first perihelion pass of Parker Solar Probe (PSP). However, the underlying physical processes responsible for the formation of the solar wind have not yet been observationally confirmed at distances closer than 10 $R_{\odot}$. We aim to infer the mode population of density fluctuations observed by radio occultation, which has all been attributed to slow magnetoacoustic waves. We compare the radio occultation observations conducted in 2016 using the JAXA's Venus orbiter Akatsuki with the MHD simulation. The time-frequency analysis was applied to the density fluctuations observed by the radio occultation and those reproduced in the MHD model. The time-spatial spectrum of the density fluctuation in the model exhibits two components that are considered to be fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves. The fast magnetoacoustic waves in the model tend to have periods shorter than the slow magnetoacoustic waves, and the superposition of these modes has a broadened spectrum extending in the range of approximately 20$-$1000 s, which resembles that of the observed waves. Based on this comparison, it is probable that the density oscillations observed by radio occultation include fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, and that fast magnetoacoustic waves are predominant at short periods and slow magnetoacoustic waves are prevalent at long periods. This is qualitatively similar to the results of the mode decomposition obtained from the PSP's first perihelion at more distance regions.</description>

Abstract: Inference of joule-class THz radiation sources from microchannel targets driven with hundreds of joule, picosecond lasers is reported. THz sources of this magnitude are useful for nonlinear pumping of matter and for charged-particle acceleration and manipulation. Microchannel targets demonstrate increased laser-THz conversion efficiency compared to planar foil targets, with laser energy to THz energy conversion up to approximately 0.9% in the best cases.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber Calibration for an Imaging Refractometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An imaging refractrometer can be used to describe the properties of a high-energy density plasma by analyzing the transverse intensity distribution of a laser beam that has passed through the plasma. The output of the refractrometer can be directly calibrated in terms of beam deflection angles using ray transfer matrix analysis. This paper describes a novel way to calibrate the refractrometer output in terms of the spatial wavenumbers of the transverse intensity distribution of the laser beam. This is accomplished by replacing the plasma with a gridded structure that modulates the transverse intensity of the beam, producing an intensity distribution with a known Fourier Transform. This calibration technique will generate a one-to-one mapping of deflection angle to wavenumber and will enable measurement of the size of Fourier space available to the system. The spectrum of wavenumbers generated when the laser beam passes through a high-energy density plasma may contain information about the types of density fluctuation that are present in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Resilient Stellarator Divertor Characteristics in the Helically Symmetric eXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resilient divertor features connected to open chaotic edge structures in the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) are investigated. For the first time, an expanded vessel wall was considered that would give space for implementation of a physical divertor target structure. The analysis was done for four different magnetic configurations with very different chaotic plasma edges. A resilient plasma wall interaction pattern was identified across all configurations. This manifests as qualitatively very similar footprint behavior across the different plasma equilibria. Overall, the resilient field lines of interest with high connection length $L_C$ lie within a helical band along the wall for all configurations. This resiliency can be used to identify the best location of a divertor. The details of the magnetic footprint's resilient helical band is subject to specific field line structures which are linked to the penetration depth of field lines into the plasma and directly influence the heat and particle flux patterns. The differences arising from these details are characterized by introducing a new metric, the minimum radial connection $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ of a field line from the last closed flux surface. The relationship, namely the deviation from a scaling law, between $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ and $L_C$ of the field lines in the plasma edge field line behavior suggests that the field lines are associated with structures such as resonant islands, cantori, and turnstiles. This helps determine the relevant magnetic flux channels based on the radial location of these chaotic edge structures and the divertor target footprint. These details will need to be taken into account for resilient divertor design.</description>

      <title>Influence of plasma particle flow on dust grain charging and on particle number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamic evolution of dust electrical potential and plasma particle number densities with a focus on the charging of dust grains through electron and ion absorption, as described by the orbital motion limited (OML) theory. The initial model, which does not account for plasma particle sources and sinks, predicts that dust grains could eventually absorb all plasma particles, leading to a null electrical potential. To address this, we introduced source and sink terms considering a finite region of space in order to simulate real conditions. Our findings indicate that, with the inclusion of plasma particle flow into and out of the region, dust grains reach a stable, non-zero equilibrium potential and the electron and ion densities reach an equilibrium value. This equilibrium is dependent on the size of the region; larger regions result in lower plasma densities and more negative equilibrium potentials. For extensive regions, the dust potential initially mirrors the scenario without sources or sinks but eventually deviates, showing increasing negative values as the region size grows. This behavior is attributed to the electron source term surpassing the combined sink and absorption terms at certain intervals along time evolution.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>Efficient electron heating by laser in finite sized plasma micro-globular targets by repeated collisions of surface and bulk waves</title>

Abstract: A new mechanism of enhanced laser energy absorption in plasma microglobules is demonstrated with the help of two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. The mechanism relies on the excitation of surface and bulk waves and the occurrence of repeated collisions in the confines of the finite-sized microglobular target. The episodic increase in the average particle energy correlates with the repeated collision of the surface and bulk waves that get excited by the laser on the target. It is shown that the size of the microglobular target governs the efficiency of absorption and the timings of episodic events of energy enhancement. This study thereby illustrates the novel efficient possibility that a closed plasma target provides for energy extraction. Parallels of such colliding waves creating havoc in terms of wave breaking etc. can be witnessed on the ocean surface, seismic disturbances traversing as body waves traverse reflecting and refracting in the interior of the Earth along with surface waves (propagating on the curved surface of the Earth) converge at the antipode to create destruction. Our studies here show the importance of choosing closed targets which aid in the process of repeated energy transfer to particles and often their thermalization. The waves keep propagating in the closed confines rather than getting dissipated over an extended region as would happen for extended targets.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Taylor Instability in Multiple Finite-Thickness Fluid Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>
