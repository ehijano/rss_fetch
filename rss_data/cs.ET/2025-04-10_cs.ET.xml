      <title>BIFROST: Reinventing WiFi Signals Based on Dispersion Effect for Accurate Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart applications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade. Most of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work, while a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor environments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for accurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is far from being satisfactory. This paper presents BIFROST, a novel hardware-software co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of BIFROST is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals for localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of signals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in design of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in Channel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise. We implement BIFROST and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results show that the median localization error of BIFROST is 0.81m, which is 52.35% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when combined with BIFROST to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the localization error by 33.54%.</description>

      <title>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hybrid XOR$-$CNF SAT Problems Natively with In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is a computationally challenging decision problem central to many industrial applications. For SAT problems in cryptanalysis, circuit design, and telecommunication, solutions can often be found more efficiently by representing them with a combination of exclusive OR (XOR) and conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses. We propose a hardware accelerator architecture that natively embeds and solves such hybrid CNF$-$XOR problems using in-memory computing hardware. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm and demonstrate, both experimentally and through simulations, how it can be efficiently implemented with memristor crossbar arrays. Compared to the conventional approaches that translate CNF$-$XOR problems to pure CNF problems, our simulations show that the accelerator improves computation speed, energy efficiency, and chip area utilization by $\sim$10$\times$ for a set of hard cryptographic benchmarking problems. Moreover, the accelerator achieves a $\sim$10$\times$ speedup and a $\sim$1000$\times$ gain in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art SAT solvers running on CPUs.</description>

      <title>Language-Dependent Political Bias in AI: A Study of ChatGPT and Gemini</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As leading examples of large language models, ChatGPT and Gemini claim to provide accurate and unbiased information, emphasizing their commitment to political neutrality and avoidance of personal bias. This research investigates the political tendency of large language models and the existence of differentiation according to the query language. For this purpose, ChatGPT and Gemini were subjected to a political axis test using 14 different languages. The findings of the study suggest that these large language models do exhibit political tendencies, with both models demonstrating liberal and leftist biases. A comparative analysis revealed that Gemini exhibited a more pronounced liberal and left-wing tendency compared to ChatGPT. The study also found that these political biases varied depending on the language used for inquiry. The study delves into the factors that constitute political tendencies and linguistic differentiation, exploring differences in the sources and scope of educational data, structural and grammatical features of languages, cultural and political contexts, and the model's response to linguistic features. From this standpoint, and an ethical perspective, it is proposed that artificial intelligence tools should refrain from asserting a lack of political tendencies and neutrality, instead striving for political neutrality and executing user queries by incorporating these tendencies.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent VR Training: A Physiological Adaptation Framework for Cognitive Load and Stress Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) systems have the potential to enhance training and learning experiences by dynamically responding to users' cognitive states. This research investigates how eye tracking and heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to detect cognitive load and stress in VR environments, enabling real-time adaptation. The study follows a three-phase approach: (1) conducting a user study with the Stroop task to label cognitive load data and train machine learning models to detect high cognitive load, (2) fine-tuning these models with new users and integrating them into an adaptive VR system that dynamically adjusts training difficulty based on physiological signals, and (3) developing a privacy-aware approach to detect high cognitive load and compare this with the adaptive VR in Phase two. This research contributes to affective computing and adaptive VR using physiological sensing, with applications in education, training, and healthcare. Future work will explore scalability, real-time inference optimization, and ethical considerations in physiological adaptive VR.</description>

      <title>Bridging Research and Standardization: Innovations and Methodology for 6G Standard Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition towards 6G presents unique challenges and opportunities in mobile networks design and standardization. Addressing these challenges requires a robust methodology for analyzing and selecting innovations that can be effectively translated into 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) contributions. This paper presents a systematic approach to bridging research and standardization, ensuring that cutting-edge advancements extend beyond academia and translate into concrete standardization efforts. The proposed methodology has been applied within the Italian RESTART framework to two ongoing research areas: Morphable Programmable Networks (MPNs) and Network Digital Twins (NDTs), both key enablers of next-generation networks. MPNs enhance dynamic adaptability and resource management, while NDTs enable real-time simulation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making. Their integration into 3GPP Release 20 will be instrumental in shaping a flexible and future-proof mobile ecosystem. These innovations exemplify how research-driven solutions can align with 6G standardization objectives. By applying the proposed methodology, we aim to establish a systematic pathway for transitioning research into impactful 3GPP contributions, ultimately driving the evolution of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>A Year of the DSA Transparency Database: What it (Does Not) Reveal About Platform Moderation During the 2024 European Parliament Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms face heightened risks during major political events; yet, how platforms adapt their moderation practices in response remains unclear. The Digital Services Act Transparency Database offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study content moderation at scale, enabling researchers and policymakers to assess platforms' compliance and effectiveness. Herein, we analyze 1.58 billion self-reported moderation actions taken by eight large social media platforms during an extended period of eight months surrounding the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our findings reveal a lack of adaptation in moderation strategies, as platforms did not exhibit significant changes in their enforcement behaviors surrounding the elections. This raises concerns about whether platforms adapted their moderation practices at all, or if structural limitations of the database concealed possible adjustments. Moreover, we found that noted transparency and accountability issues persist nearly a year after initial concerns were raised. These results highlight the limitations of current self-regulatory approaches and underscore the need for stronger enforcement and data access mechanisms to ensure that online platforms uphold their responsibility in safeguarding democratic processes.</description>

      <title>Context Switching for Secure Multi-programming of Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-programming quantum computers improve device utilization and throughput. However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems.
  We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</description>

      <title>Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.</description>
