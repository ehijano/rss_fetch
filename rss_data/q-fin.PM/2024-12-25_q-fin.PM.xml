      <title>Dynamic Optimization of Portfolio Allocation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming financial investment decision-making paradigms, with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) demonstrating significant application potential in domains such as robo-advisory services. Given that traditional portfolio optimization methods face significant challenges in effectively managing dynamic asset weight adjustments, this paper approaches the problem from the perspective of practical trading processes and develops a dynamic optimization model using deep reinforcement learning to achieve more effective asset allocation. The study's innovations are twofold: First, we propose a Sharpe ratio reward function specifically designed for Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which optimizes portfolio performance by maximizing the average Sharpe ratio through random sampling and reinforcement learning algorithms during the training process; Second, we design deep neural networks that are specifically structured to meet asset optimization objectives. The study empirically evaluates the model using randomly selected constituent stocks from the CSI300 index and conducts comparative analyses against traditional approaches, including mean-variance optimization and risk parity strategies. Backtesting results demonstrate the dynamic optimization model's effectiveness in portfolio asset allocation, yielding enhanced risk reduction, superior risk-return metrics, and optimal performance across comprehensive evaluation criteria.</description>

      <title>Indices of quadratic programs over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an abstract perspective on quadratic programming with an eye toward long portfolio theory geared toward explaining sparsity via maximum principles. Specifically, in optimal allocation problems, we see that support of an optimal distribution lies in a variety intersect a kind of distinguished boundary of a compact subspace to be allocated over. We demonstrate some of its intelligence by using it to solve mazes and interpret such behavior as the underlying space trying to understand some hypothetical platonic index for which the capital asset pricing model holds.</description>

      <title>Discretization of continuous-time arbitrage strategies in financial markets with fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the practical usefulness of continuous-time arbitrage strategies designed to exploit serial correlation in fractional financial markets. Specifically, we revisit the strategies of Shiryaev (1998) and Salopek (1998) and transfer them to a real-world setting by distretizing their dynamics and introducing transaction costs. In Monte Carlo simulations with various market and trading parameter settings as well as a formal analysis of discretization error, we show that both are promising with respect to terminal portfolio values and loss probabilities. These features and complementary sparsity make them worth serious consideration in the toolkit of quantitative investors.</description>
