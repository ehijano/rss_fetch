      <title>Confining Strings and the Worldsheet Axion from the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a major update on the spectrum of closed flux tubes in $D=3+1$ $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We measure the excitation spectrum of confining strings wound around a spatial dimension of a size $R$. We do so for the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N=3,5,6$ and for two different values of the lattice spacing. We employ the generalized eigenvalue problem in combination with an extended basis of operators; this enables us to project onto all possible irreducible representations characterised by spin $|J_{\rm modulo \ 4}|$, transverse parity $P_{\perp}$, longitudinal parity $P_{\parallel}$ as well as by longitudinal momentum $p_{\parallel}=\frac{2 \pi q}{R}$, and extract accurate results for approximately $35$ lightest states. Applying the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) technique for calculating the finite volume spectrum, we confirm that the observed states are well described by the low energy effective theory of a long string consisting of two translational Goldstone bosons (``phonons"), along with a massive pseudoscalar (``the worldsheet axion") coupled to phonons through a $\theta$-term. Moreover, we find that the leading axion-axion and axion-phonon interactions are well approximated by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation of a free axion.</description>

      <title>Hunting New Animalcula with Rare K and B Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the recent strategy for an efficient hunting of new animalcula with the help of rare K and B decays that avoids the use of the $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ parameters that are subject to tensions between their determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays. In particular we update the values of the $V_{cb}$-independent ratios of various K and B decay branching ratios predicted by the Standard Model. We also stress the usefulness of the $V_{cb}-\gamma$ plots in the search for new physics. We select the magnificant seven among rare K and B decays that should play a leading role in the search for new physics due to their theoretical cleanness: $B^+\to K^+(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ measured recently by Belle II and NA62, respectively, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ investigated by KOTO and also $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$ measured by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. %</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Prediction for the Pion Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the two-loop computation of the leading-twist contribution to the pion electromagnetic form factor by employing the effective field theory formalism rigorously. The next-to-next-to-leading-order short-distance matching coefficient is determined by evaluating the appropriate $5$-point QCD amplitude with the modern multi-loop technique and subsequently by implementing the ultraviolet renormalization and infrared subtractions with the inclusion of evanescent operators. The renormalization/factorization scale independence of the obtained form factor is then validated explicitly at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The yielding two-loop QCD correction to this fundamental quantity turns out to be numerically significant at experimentally accessible momentum transfers. We further demonstrate that the newly computed two-loop radiative correction is highly beneficial for an improved determination of the leading-twist pion distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Corrections to adiabatic behavior for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited in their ability to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for certain physically large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decay $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of the doubly heavy baryon $ \Xi^{++}_{cc} $ into the singly heavy baryon $ \Xi^+_{c}$ within the three point QCD sum rule approach in two possible lepton channels. Our analysis includes perturbative as well as nonperturbative condensation contributions up to dimension five. We evaluate the form factors of this semileptonic decay entering the amplitude described by the vector and axial vector transition currents. The fit functions of the form factors with respect to the transferred momentum squared are utilized to predict the decay widths and branching ratios of the $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ channels. We compare our findings with other predictions in the literature. Our outcomes can be useful for experimental groups in their search for the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons and may be checked via future experiments such as LHCb.</description>
