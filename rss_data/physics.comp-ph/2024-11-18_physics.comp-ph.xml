      <title>From Mesh to Neural Nets: A Multi-Method Evaluation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Galerkin Finite Element Method for Solving Nonlinear Convection-Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling complex phenomena in fields such as biology, ecology, population dynamics, physics, and engineering. Numerical approximation of these non-linear systems is essential due to the challenges of obtaining exact solutions. Traditionally, the Galerkin finite element method (GFEM) has been the standard computational tool for solving these PDEs. With the advancements in machine learning, Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) has emerged as a promising alternative for approximating non-linear PDEs.
  In this study, we compare the performance of PINN and GFEM by solving four distinct one-dimensional CRD problems with varying initial and boundary conditions and evaluate the performance of PINN over GFEM. This evaluation metrics includes error estimates, and visual representations of the solutions, supported by statistical methods such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), the standard deviation of error, the the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and the coefficient of variation (CV) test.
  Our findings reveal that while both methods achieve solutions close to the analytical results, PINN demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency. PINN achieved significantly lower RMSE values and smaller standard deviations for Burgers' equation, Fisher's equation, and Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation, indicating higher accuracy and greater consistency. While GFEM shows slightly better accuracy for the Burgers-Huxley equation, its performance was less consistent over time. In contrast, PINN exhibit more reliable and robust performance, highlighting their potential as a cutting-edge approach for solving non-linear PDEs.</description>

      <title>Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in the boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of reflected Brownian motion near the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating diffusive processes in confinements and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks need a physicist to be accurate: the case of mass and heat transport in Fischer-Tropsch catalyst particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an influential technology, merging the swift and automated capabilities of machine learning with the precision and dependability of simulations grounded in theoretical physics. PINNs are often employed to solve algebraic or differential equations to replace some or even all steps of multi-stage computational workflows, leading to their significant speed-up. However, wide adoption of PINNs is still hindered by reliability issues, particularly at extreme ends of the input parameter ranges. In this study, we demonstrate this in the context of a system of coupled non-linear differential reaction-diffusion and heat transfer equations related to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which are solved by a finite-difference method with a PINN used in evaluating their source terms. It is shown that the testing strategies traditionally used to assess the accuracy of neural networks as function approximators can overlook the peculiarities which ultimately cause instabilities of the finite-difference solver. We propose a domain knowledge-based modifications to the PINN architecture ensuring its correct asymptotic behavior. When combined with an improved numerical scheme employed as an initial guess generator, the proposed modifications are shown to recover the overall stability of the simulations, while preserving the speed-up brought by PINN as the workflow component. We discuss the possible applications of the proposed hybrid transport equation solver in context of chemical reactors simulations.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrolyte solutions play critical role in a vast range of important applications, yet an accurate and scalable method of predicting their properties without fitting to experiment has remained out of reach, despite over a century of effort. Here, we combine state-of-the-art density functional theory and equivariant neural network potentials to demonstrate this capability, reproducing key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties. We show that neural network potentials (NNPs) can be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained/continuum-solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales than possible with all atom simulations. We observe the surprising formation of Li cation dimers along with identical anion-anion pairing of chloride and bromide anions. Finally, we reproduce simulate the crystal phase and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained only on moderate concentration solutions. This approach should be scaled to build a greatly expanded database of electrolyte solution properties than currently exists.</description>
