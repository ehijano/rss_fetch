      <title>Multi-Motor Cargo Navigation in Complex Cytoskeletal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is a major driver of anterograde transport of vesicles and organelles within eukaryotic cells via microtubules. Numerous studies have elucidated the step-size, velocities, forces, and navigation ability of kinesins both in reconstituted systems and in live cells. Outside of cells, the kinesin-based transport is physically regulated and can be controlled by obstacles or defects in the path, or the interaction between several motors on the same cargo. To explore the physical control parameters on kinesin-driven transport, we created complex microtubule networks in vitro to test how kinesin cargoes made from quantum dots with one to 10 kinesin motors attached are able to navigate the network. We find that many motors on the quantum dot significantly alter distance walked, time spent bound, the average speed, and the tortuosity of the cargo. We also find that the average mesh size of the microtubule network affects the end-to-end distance of the motion, the run time, average speed and tortuosity of cargoes. Thus, both motor number and network density are physical aspects that regulate where cargoes traverse in space and time.</description>

      <title>Conditional Enzyme Generation Using Protein Language Models with Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional generation of proteins with desired functions and/or properties is a key goal for generative models. Existing methods based on prompting of language models can generate proteins conditioned on a target functionality, such as a desired enzyme family. However, these methods are limited to simple, tokenized conditioning and have not been shown to generalize to unseen functions. In this study, we propose ProCALM (Protein Conditionally Adapted Language Model), an approach for the conditional generation of proteins using adapters to protein language models. Our specific implementation of ProCALM involves finetuning ProGen2 to incorporate conditioning representations of enzyme function and taxonomy. ProCALM matches existing methods at conditionally generating sequences from target enzyme families. Impressively, it can also generate within the joint distribution of enzymatic function and taxonomy, and it can generalize to rare and unseen enzyme families and taxonomies. Overall, ProCALM is a flexible and computationally efficient approach, and we expect that it can be extended to a wide range of generative language models.</description>

      <title>Double-Strand Break Clustering: An Economical and Effective Strategy for DNA Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mammalian cells, repair centers for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) have been identified. However, previous researches predominantly rely on methods that induce specific DSBs by cutting particular DNA sequences. The clustering and its spatiotemporal properties of non-specifically DSBs, especially those induced by environmental stresses such as irradiation, remains unclear. In this study, we used Dragonfly microscopy to induce high-precision damage in cells and discovered that DSB clustering during the early stages of DNA damage response (DDR) and repair, but not during the repair plateau phase. Early in DDR, DSB clustered into existing 53BP1 foci. The DSB clustering at different stages has different implications for DNA repair. By controlling the distance between adjacent damage points, we found that the probability of DSB clustering remains constant at distances of 0.8 - 1.4 um, while clustering does not occur beyond 1.4 um. Within the 0.8 um range, the probability of clustering significantly increases due to the phase separation effect of 53BP1. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we developed a dynamic model of 53BP1 foci formation, fission, and fusion. This model accurately predicts experimental outcomes and further demonstrates the temporal and spatial influences on DSB clustering. These results showed that, similarly to specifically induced DSBs, non-specifically induced DSBs can also cluster. The extent of DSB clustering is influenced by both temporal and spatial factors, which provide new insights into the dynamics of DSB clustering and the role of 53BP1 in DNA repair processes. Such findings could enhance our understanding of DNA damage responses and help us improve DNA repair therapies in disease.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence for Navigating Synthesizable Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SynFormer, a generative modeling framework designed to efficiently explore and navigate synthesizable chemical space. Unlike traditional molecular generation approaches, we generate synthetic pathways for molecules to ensure that designs are synthetically tractable. By incorporating a scalable transformer architecture and a diffusion module for building block selection, SynFormer surpasses existing models in synthesizable molecular design. We demonstrate SynFormer's effectiveness in two key applications: (1) local chemical space exploration, where the model generates synthesizable analogs of a reference molecule, and (2) global chemical space exploration, where the model aims to identify optimal molecules according to a black-box property prediction oracle. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach via the improvement in performance as more computational resources become available. With our code and trained models openly available, we hope that SynFormer will find use across applications in drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning: Towards General-Purpose Protein Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins, as essential biomolecules, play a central role in biological processes, including metabolic reactions and DNA replication. Accurate prediction of their properties and functions is crucial in biological applications. Recent development of protein language models (pLMs) with supervised fine tuning provides a promising solution to this problem. However, the fine-tuned model is tailored for particular downstream prediction task, and achieving general-purpose protein understanding remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework to bridge this gap. Our approach integrates a noval structure-aware module into pLMs to inform them with structural knowledge, and then connects these enhanced pLMs to large language models (LLMs) to generate understanding of proteins. In this framework, we propose a novel two-stage instruction tuning pipeline that first establishes a basic understanding of proteins through caption-based instructions and then refines this understanding using a mixture of experts (MoEs) to learn more complex properties and functional information with the same amount of activated parameters. Moreover, we construct the largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date, which allows us to train and evaluate the general-purpose protein understanding model. Extensive experimental results on open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SEPIT over both closed-source general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>
