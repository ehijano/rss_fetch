      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities and universal approximators for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities are indispensable tools in the study of dimension reduction and low-distortion embeddings of graphs into metric spaces, and have found remarkable algorithmic applications. A basic open problem, posed by Jon Kleinberg (2013), asks whether the optimal nonlinear Poincar\'e constant for maps between two independent $3$-regular random graphs is dimension-free, i.e., independent of vertex-set sizes. We give a complete and affirmative resolution to Kleinberg's problem, also allowing for arbitrary graph degrees. As a corollary, we obtain a stochastic construction of $O(1)\text{-universal}$ approximators for random graphs, answering a question of Mendel and Naor.</description>

      <title>Old problem revisited: Which equilateral convex polygons tile the plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified proof of a forty-year-old result concerning the tiling of the plane with equilateral convex polygons. Our new approach is based on a theorem by M. Rao, who used an exhaustive computer search to confirm the completeness of the well-known list of fifteen pentagon types. Assuming the validity of Rao's result, we provide a concise and entirely geometrical proof of a tiling theorem originally due to Hirschhorn and Hunt.</description>

      <title>Compression Maps Between Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A shape of a combinatorial polytope is a convex embedding into Euclidean space. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a piecewise linear map between two shapes of the same polytope to be a compression (respectively a weak compression), meaning a distance decreasing (respectively a distance non-increasing) map between distinct pairs of points. We establish that there is a partial order on the space of shapes given by the relation of having a weak compression map between pairs of shapes.
  Finally, we construct a compression metric on the projective shape space of a polytope; the space of convex Euclidean realizations modulo rigid motions and homothety. For the projective space shape of a simplex, we show that the compression metric is complete. For general polytopes, we establish that the projective shape space has a natural completion given by the projective shape space of weakly convex realizations.</description>

      <title>First moments of a polyhedron clipped by a quadratic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript extends previous work by Evrard et al. [arXiv:2210.07772] on calculating the geometric moments of the intersection between a polyhedron and the domain bounded by a quadratic surface. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the first geometric moments (i.e., the volume and volume-weighted centroid) of a polyhedron intersecting the interior of an infinite quadratic cylinder, following the same methodology of successive applications of the divergence theorem as in [arXiv:2210.07772]. The newly obtained expressions are then validated through extensive numerical tests, demonstrating their accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>A remark on subharmonicity for symmetric Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We remove the local boundedness for $\mathscr{E}_{\alpha}$-subharmonicity in the framework of (not necessarily strongly local) regular symmetric Dirichlet form $(\mathscr{E},D(\mathscr{E}))$ with $\alpha\geq0$ and establish the stochastic characterization for $\mathscr{E}$-subharmonic functions without assuming the local boundedness.</description>

      <title>A non-sticky Kakeya set of Lebesgue measure zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kakeya set conjecture in ${\mathbb R} ^3$ was recently resolved by Wang and Zahl. The distinction between sticky and non-sticky Kakeya sets plays an important role in their proof. Although the proof did not require the Kakeya set to be Lebesgue measure zero, measure zero Kakeya sets are the crucial case whose study is required to resolve the conjecture. In this paper, we explicitly construct a non-sticky Kakeya set of Lebesgue measure zero in ${\mathbb R}^2$ (and hence in any dimension). We also construct non-trivial sticky and non-sticky Kakeya sets in high dimension that are not formed by taking the Cartesian product of a 2-dimensional Kakeya set with ${\mathbb R}^{d-2}$, and we verify that both Kakeya sets have Hausdorff dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsed spaces with Ricci curvature bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.02060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a definition of non-collapsed space with Ricci curvature bounded from below and we prove the versions of Colding's volume convergence theorem and of Cheeger-Colding dimension gap estimate for ${\sf RCD}$ spaces.
  In particular this establishes the stability of non-collapsed spaces under non-collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Auto-Lesion Segmentation with a Novel Intensity Dark Channel Prior for COVID-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.</description>
