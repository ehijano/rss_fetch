      <title>Existence of flat flows for volume-preserving mean curvature flow with contact angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of a droplet evolving by mean curvature with volume constraint and contact angle condition on a half space. We prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution, called the flat flow. A difficulty arises when we establish the local-in-time equi-boundedness of approximate solutions and a uniform $L^2$-estimate of multipliers. The difficulty is handled by conducting blowup analysis at a point in contact to a spherical cap with sharp angle.</description>

      <title>The preservation of nonnegativity of solutions of a parabolic system with the cubed Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the easily verifiable necessary condition of the preservation of the nonnegativity of the solutions of a system of parabolic equations containing the cubed Laplacian. Such necessary condition is extremely important for the applied analysis community since it imposes the necessary form of the system of equations that must be studied mathematically.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a problem that can be viewed as a natural variation of the so-called Pompeiu or Schiffer problem in the context of scattering of plane waves for the Linear Helmholtz equation. For the two dimensional version of this variation, we establish conditions on the wave numbers and incident directions, that ensure a non-vanishing scattered field.</description>

      <title>Boundary effect on asymptotic behaviour of solution to the hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the global existence and stability of solution to the quasi linear hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis system on the half-line,which was proposed in[1] to primarily
  describe the formation of coherent vascular networks observed invitro experiment. Under two diffrent
  boundary conditions,we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the asymptotic
  state equation (the so-called nonlinear diffusion wave),and then prove that the solution of the original
  equation is nonlinearly asymptotically stable. Additionally,we obtain the convergence rates for both
  types of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic profile of solutions to semilinear damped wave equations with critical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a semilinear damped wave equation with the nonlinear term $|u|^{1+2/n} \mu(|u|)$, where $\mu$ is a modulus of continuity. In recent papers by Ebert,Girardi,Reissig (Math. Ann. 378 (2020)) and Girardi (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 32 (2025)), the authors obtained a sharp critical condition on $\mu$ in low space dimensions $n=1,2,3$, which determines the threshold between global (in time) existence of small data solutions and blow-up of solutions in finite time. Our new results are to prove that this condition remains valid in dimension $n=4$, together with the asymptotic profiles of global solutions. From this, we see that the behavior of the solution at $t \to \infty$ is identified by the Gauss kernel. Finally, a sharp lifespan estimate for local solutions is also derived in the case when blow-up occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Brezis-Nirenberg problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u = \lambda u+|u|^{2^*-2}u, \quad &amp;\mbox{in}\,\Omega,\\ &amp;u=0,\quad &amp;\mbox{on}\, \partial\Omega, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega $ is a smoothly bounded domain of $\mathbb R^N$ with $N\geq 3$, $\lambda&gt;0$ is a parameter and $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent. We first recall the history of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem and then provide new results of it in dimension six. Finally, we also list some open questions on the Brezis-Nirenberg problem.</description>

      <title>On Brinkman flows with curvature-induced phase separation in binary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical analysis of diffuse-interface models for multiphase flows has attracted significant attention due to their ability to capture complex interfacial dynamics, including curvature effects, within a unified, energetically consistent framework. In this work, we study a novel Brinkman-Cahn-Hilliard system, coupling a sixth-order phase-field evolution with a Brinkman-type momentum equation featuring variable shear viscosity. The Cahn-Hilliard equation includes a nonconservative source term accounting for mass exchange, and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing term. We establish the existence of weak solutions in a divergence-free variational framework, and, in the case of constant mobility and shear viscosity, prove uniqueness and continuous dependence on the forcing. Additionally, we analyze the Darcy limit, providing existence results for the corresponding reduced system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long time evolution of internal waves in two dimensional subcritical channels with flat horizontal ends. We show the leading profiles of solutions are the outgoing solutions to the stationary equations. This is done by showing a limiting absorption principle and the differentiability of the spectral measure for a zeroth order operator.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical null controllability of a degenerate parabolic equation with nonlocal coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Stackelberg-Nash strategy to show the local null controllability of a parabolic equation where the diffusion coefficient is the product of a degenerate function in space and a nonlocal term. We consider one control called \textit{leader} and two controls called \textit{followers}. To each leader we associate a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem; then, we find a leader that solves the null controllability problem. The linearized degenerated system is treated adapting Carleman estimates for degenerated systems from Demarque, L\'imaco and Viana \cite{DemarqueLimacoViana_deg_sys2020} and the local controllability of the non-linear system is obtained using Liusternik's inverse function theorem. The nonlocal coefficient originates a multiplicative coupling in the optimality system that gives rise to interesting calculations in the applications of the inverse function theorem.</description>

      <title>Wigner measure approach to the derivation of the Landau-Pekar equations in the mean-field limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of the Landau-Pekar equations from the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian in the mean-field limit using Wigner measure techniques. On the classical side, we extend the global well-posedness results up to $L^2 \oplus L^2$. For obtaining the classical limit, we make a crucial use on the quantum side of the Gross transform, allowing us to study the system on the energy space, and with no ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <title>Values of Finite Distortion: Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove continuity for mappings $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in the Sobolev class $W^{1,n}_{\text{loc}}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ that satisfy the inequality \[
  \lvert Df(x) \rvert^n \le K(x) \det Df(x) + \Sigma(x) \] whenever $K \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ and $\Sigma \in L^q_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ with $p^{-1} + q^{-1} &lt; 1$. This closes a significant gap between existing methods and known counterexamples. The result is sharp, new even in the planar case, and opens a systematic study of mappings with values of finite distortion in geometric function theory. As a key part of the proof, we introduce an overlooked Sobolev-type inequality based on measures of superlevel sets.</description>

      <title>Well posedness of F. John's floating body problem for a fixed object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove the well-posedness of F. John's floating body problem in the case of a fixed object and for unsteady waves, in horizontal dimension $d=1$ and with a possibly emerging bottom. This problem describes the interactions of waves with a partially immersed object using the linearized Bernoulli equations. The fluid domain $\Omega$ therefore has corners where the object meets the free surface, which consists of various connected components. The energy space associated with this problem involves the space of traces on these different connected components of all functions in the Beppo-Levi space $\dot{H}^1(\Omega)$; we characterize this space, exhibiting non local effects linking the different connected components. We prove the well-posedness of the Laplace equation in corner domains, with mixed boundary conditions and Dirichlet data in this trace space, and study several properties of the associated Dirichlet-Neumann operator (self-adjointness, ellipticity properties, etc.). This trace space being only semi-normed, we cannot use standard semi-group theory to solve F. John's problem: one has to choose a realization of the homogeneous space (i.e. choose an adequate representative in the equivalence class) we are working with. When the fluid domain is bounded, this realization is obtained by imposing a zero-mass condition; for unbounded fluid domains, we have to choose a space-time realization which can be interpreted as a particular choice of the Bernoulli constant. Well-posedness in the energy space is then proved. Conditions for higher order regularity in times are then derived, which yield some limited space regularity that can be improved through smallness assumption on the contact angles. We finally show that higher order regularity away from the contact points can be achieved through weighted estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Carleson's convergence problem for dispersive equations $i\, \partial_t u + P(D)u=0$ in the periodic setting $\mathbb T^d$, we prove that the Sobolev exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is necessary for any non-singular polynomial symbol $P$, including the natural powers of the Laplacian $\Delta^k$. This is in contrast with the results known in the Euclidean case, in which for symbols $P(\xi) = |\xi|^a$ with $a &gt; 1$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is sufficient, but we do not know if it is necessary.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with a shock wave detached from the leading edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate the mathematical aspects of supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with diamond-shaped cross sections in the case of a shock wave detached from the leading edges. The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. Mathematically, this problem can be reformulated as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation in conical coordinates. By establishing a Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain strictly away from the degenerate boundary. Using this property, we further prove the existence of a solution to the problem via the continuity method and vanishing viscosity method.</description>

Abstract: We prove optimal Lipschitz regularity for weak solutions of the measure-valued $p$-Poisson equation $-\Delta_p u = Q \; \mathcal{H}^{n-1} \llcorner \Gamma$. Here $p \in (1,2)$, $\Gamma$ is a compact and connected $C^2$-hypersurface without boundary, and $Q$ is a positive $W^{2,\infty}$-density. This equation can be understood as a nonlinear interface transmission problem. Our main result extends previous studies of the linear case and provides further insights on a delicate limit case of (linear and nonlinear) potential theory.</description>

      <title>Sharp bilinear eigenfunction estimate, $L^\infty_{x_2}L^p_{t,x_1}$-type Strichartz estimate, and energy-critical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish \textit{sharp} bilinear and multilinear eigenfunction estimates for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the standard three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, eliminating the logarithmic loss that has persisted in the literature since the pioneering work of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov over twenty years ago. This completes the theory of multilinear eigenfunction estimates on the standard spheres. Our approach relies on viewing $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the compact Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and exploiting its representation theory, especially the properties of \mbox{Clebsch-Gordan} coefficients.
  Motivated by applications to the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we also prove a refined Strichartz estimate of mixed-norm type $L^\infty_{x_2}L^4_{t,x_1}$ on the cylindrical space $\mathbb{R}_{x_1} \times \mathbb{T}_{x_2}$, adapted to certain spectrally localized functions. The argument relies on a combination of precise measure estimates and a novel \textit{kernel decomposition method}. As an additional application, this method can be used to establish the \textit{sharp} $L^4$-Strichartz estimate for the hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$.
  Combining these two key ingredients, we derive a refined bilinear Strichartz estimate on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, which in turn yields small-data global well-posedness for the above mentioned NLS in the energy space.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and large-time behavior for three-dimensional magneto-micropolar equations with horizontal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the stability and large-time behavior for 3D magneto-micropolar equations with horizontal dissipation. The global well-posedness of the aforementioned system is established, with the initial data and its vertical derivatives required to be sufficiently small in $L^2$ space. Moreover, we obtain the optimal decay rates for the $H^1$-norm of the solution. The proofs of our main results rely on the special structure of the equations and anisotropic Sobolev-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>
