      <title>Rough Bergomi turns grey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tractable extension of the rough Bergomi model, replacing the fractional Brownian motion with a generalised grey Brownian motion, which we show to be reminiscent of models with stochastic volatility of volatility. This extension breaks away from the log-Normal assumption of rough Bergomi, thereby making it a viable suggestion for the Equity Holy Grail -- the joint SPX/VIX options calibration. For this new (class of) model(s), we provide semi-closed and asymptotic formulae for SPX and VIX options and show numerically its potential advantages as well as calibration results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Dynamic Pricing in Credit Market with Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem faced by a broker seeking to learn prices for a large number of credit market securities, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, loans, and other credit-related securities. A major challenge in pricing these securities stems from their infrequent trading and the lack of transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, which leads to insufficient data for individual pricing. Nevertheless, many securities share structural similarities that can be exploited. Moreover, brokers often place small "probing" orders to infer competitors' pricing behavior. Leveraging these insights, we propose a multi-task dynamic pricing framework that leverages the shared structure across securities to enhance pricing accuracy.
  In the OTC market, a broker wins a quote by offering a more competitive price than rivals. The broker's goal is to learn winning prices while minimizing expected regret against a clairvoyant benchmark. We model each security using a $d$-dimensional feature vector and assume a linear contextual model for the competitor's pricing of the yield, with parameters unknown a priori. We propose the Two-Stage Multi-Task (TSMT) algorithm: first, an unregularized MLE over pooled data to obtain a coarse parameter estimate; second, a regularized MLE on individual securities to refine the parameters. We show that the TSMT achieves a regret bounded by $\tilde{O} ( \delta_{\max} \sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $, outperforming both fully individual and fully pooled baselines, where $M$ is the number of securities and $\delta_{\max}$ quantifies their heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity/FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities/cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>
