      <title>A New Overture to Classical Simple Type Theory, Ketonen-type Gentzen and Tableau Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Ketonen-type Gentzen-style classical simple type theory $\bf KCT$. Also the tableau system $\bf KCTT$ corresponding to $\bf KCT$ is introduced. Further inference-preserving Gentzen system $\bf KCT_h$ (equivalent to $\bf KCT$) and tableau system $\bf KCTT_h$ (equivalent to $\bf KCTT$) is introduced. We introduce the notion of Hintikka sequents for $\bf KCTT_h$.The completeness theorem and Takahashi-Prawitz's theorem are proved for $\bf KCTT_h$.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of Reinhardt cardinals with $\mathsf{ZF}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof will be presented that the existence of a non-trivial $\Sigma_1$-elementary embedding $j: V_{\lambda+3} \prec V_{\lambda+3}$ is inconsistent with $\textsf{ZF}$. Sections 1 and 2 shall review various important contributions from the literature, notably including \cite{Goldberg2020}, \cite{Schlutzenberg2020}, and \cite{Woodin2010}, the latter reference being where the crucial forcing construction is presented. Section 3 shall introduce some new large cardinal properties, of consistency strength intermediate between $\mathsf{I_3}$ and $\mathsf{I_2}$, and greater than $\mathsf{I_1}$, respectively. The proof of the inconsistency with $\mathsf{ZF}$ of the existence of a non-trivial $\Sigma_1$-elementary embedding $j:V_{\lambda+3} \prec V_{\lambda+3}$ shall be given in Section 4. The claims of Sections 2 and 4 are provable in $\textsf{ZF}$; those of Section 3, with the exception of the last two theorems, in $\textsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>The directedness of the Rudin-Keisler order at measurable cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript is concerned with the Rudin-Keisler order of ultrafilters on measurable cardinals. The main theorem proved read as follows: Given regular cardinals $\lambda\leq \kappa$, the following theories are equiconsistent modulo ZFC: (1) $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal with $o(\kappa)=\lambda^+$ (resp. $o(\kappa)=\kappa$). (2) The Rudin-Keisler order restricted to the set of $\kappa$-complete (non-principal) ultrafilters on $\kappa$ is $\lambda^+$-directed (resp. $\kappa^+$-directed). The theorem reported here is proved after bridging the directedness of the RK-order with the $\lambda$-Gluing Property introduced by the authors in \cite{HP}. Our result provides what seems to be the first example of a compactness-type property at the level of measurable cardinals whose consistency strength is much lower than the existence of a strong cardinal. As part of our analysis we also answer a question of Gitik by showing that the $\aleph_0$-Gluing Property fails in his classical model from ''Changing cofinalities and the nonstationary ideal". As a consequence of this, in Gitik's model the Rudin-Keisler order fails to be $\aleph_1$-directed.</description>

      <title>Extension of Lipschitz maps definable in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theorem on extension of Lipschitz maps $f$ definable in Hensel minimal, non-trivially valued fields $K$ of equicharacteristic zero. This may be regarded as a definable, non-Archimedean, non-locally compact version of Kirszbraun's extension theorem. We proceed with double induction with respect to the dimensions of the ambient space and of the domain of $f$. To this end we introduce the concept of a definable open cell package with a skeleton, which along with the concept of a risometry plays a key role in our induction procedure.</description>

      <title>Preservation under Reduced Products in Continuous Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fragment of continuous first-order logic, analogue of Palyutin formulas (or h-formulas) in classical model theory, which is preserved under reduced products in both directions. We use it to extend classical results on complete theories which are preserved under reduced product and their stability. We also characterize the set of Palyutin sentences, Palyutin theories and other related fragments in terms of their preservation properties, both in the classical setting and the metric one.</description>

      <title>Abelian congruences and similarity in varieties with a weak difference term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of three papers motivated by the author's desire to understand and explain "algebraically" one aspect of Dmitriy Zhuk's proof of the CSP Dichotomy Theorem. In this paper we study abelian congruences in varieties having a weak difference term. Each class of the congruence supports an abelian group structure; if the congruence is minimal, each class supports the structure of a vector space over a division ring determined by the congruence. A construction due to J. Hagemann, C. Herrmann and R. Freese in the congruence modular setting extends to varieties with a weak difference term, and provides a "universal domain" for the abelian groups or vector spaces that arise from the classes of the congruence within a single class of the annihilator of the congruence. The construction also supports an extension of Freese's similarity relation (between subdirectly irreducible algebras) from the congruence modular setting to varieties with a weak difference term.</description>

      <title>Higher walks and squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the development of the theory of higher dimensional walks on ordinals began recently by Bergfalk. In particular we identify natural coherence conditions on higher dimensional $C$-sequences that entail coherence of the resultant higher rho-functions. We also introduce various higher square principles by adding non-triviality conditions to these coherent higher $C$-sequences and investigate basic properties of said square principles. For example, in analogy with the classical case, we prove that these higher square principles abound in the constructible universe but can be forced to fail, modulo large cardinals. Finally, we prove that certain higher rho-functions obtained by walking along higher square sequences exhibit non-triviality in addition to coherence. In particular, it follows that higher square principles on a cardinal $\lambda$ entail certain non-vanishing \v{C}ech cohomology groups for $\lambda$ considered with the order topology.</description>

      <title>Composition Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles and tame fields of mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in which settings we have a composition AKE principle, i.e. when the theory of the coarsening $(K,w)$ and the theory of the induced valuation $(Kw,\overline{v})$ determine the theory of the composition $(K,v)$. We show that this is the case when $(K,w)$ is tame of equal characteristic, and provide counterexamples in mixed characteristic. We further show that, for a tame field of mixed characteristic, the theory of the valued field cannot, in general, be determined solely by the theories of its underlying field, its residue field, and its value group.</description>
