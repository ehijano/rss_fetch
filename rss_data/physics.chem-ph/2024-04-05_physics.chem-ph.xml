      <title>Performant Automatic Differentiation of Local Coupled Cluster Theories: Response Properties and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a differentiable implementation of the local natural orbital coupled cluster (LNOCC) method within the automatic differentiation framework of the PySCFAD package. The implementation is comprehensively tuned for enhanced performance, which enables the calculation of first-order static response properties on medium-sized molecular systems using coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We evaluate the accuracy of our method by benchmarking it against the canonical CCSD(T) reference for nuclear gradients, dipole moments, and geometry optimizations. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of property calculations for chemically interesting systems through the computation of bond orders and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy parameters for a [NiFe]-hydrogenase active site model, along with the simulation of infrared (IR) spectra via ab initio LNO-CC molecular dynamics for a protonated water hexamer.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics of autocatalytic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to clarify how the stoichiometric trait of autocatalytic networks, namely their absence of a conservation law, shapes their non-equilibrium behavior. To do so, we consider an autocatalytic network coupled with external species acting as food/waste materials, necessary to fulfill mass conservation. Then, we show that the production of autocatalytic species requires a conservative influx of these external species. From this, we derive the thermodynamic potential of an autocatalytic sub-network. The latter can be obtained from the usual semigrand free-energy of an open system by taking into account the conservative work associated to the influx of external species fueling the production of autocatalytic species. In the end, we identify the cost dedicated to the production of autocatalytic species and its efficiency. It reveals that sustaining steady production of species in an autocatalytic network is possible only if they are coupled with the environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode masers of thermally polarized nuclear spins in solution NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental single and multimode sustained 1H NMR masers in solution on thermally polarized spins at room temperature and 9.4 T achieved through the electronic control of radiation feedback (radiation damping). Our observations illustrate the breakdown of the usual three-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch equations for radiation feedback and a simple toy model of few coupled classical moments is used to interpret these experiments.</description>

      <title>Surrogate optimization of variational quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers are touted as a near-term algorithm capable of impacting many applications. However, the potential has not yet been realized, with few claims of quantum advantage and high resource estimates, especially due to the need for optimization in the presence of noise. Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for VQE or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical CPU/GPU) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, passed as an input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.</description>

      <title>Functionality Optimization for Singlet Fission Rate Screening in the Full-Dimensional Molecular and Intermolecular Coordinate Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational chemistry, accurately predicting molecular configurations that exhibit specific properties remains a critical challenge. Its intricacies become especially evident in the study of molecular aggregates, where the light-induced functionality is tied to highly structure-dependent electronic couplings between molecules. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the targeted screening of the structural space employing a "functionality optimization" technique, in which a chosen descriptor, constrained by the ground state energy expression, is optimized. The chosen algorithmic differentiation (AD) framework allows to automatically obtain gradients without its tedious implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by identifying Perylene Bisiimide (PBI) dimer motifs with enhanced SF rate. Our findings reveal that certain structural modifications of the PBI monomer, such as helical twisting and bending, as well as slipped-rotated packing arrangements, can significantly increase the SF rate.</description>

      <title>Pursuing colloidal diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The endeavor to selectively fabricate a cubic diamond is challenging due to the formation of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or others possessing similar free energy. The necessity to achieve this is of paramount importance since the cubic diamond is the only polymorph exhibiting a complete photonic bandgap, making it a promising candidate in view of photonic applications. Herein, we demonstrate that due to the presence of an external field and delicate manipulation of its strength we can attain selectivity in the formation of a cubic diamond in a one-component system comprised of designer tetrahedral patchy particles. The driving force of such a phenomenon is the structure of the first adlayer which is commensurate with the (110) face of the cubic diamond. Moreover, after a successful nucleation event, once the external field is turned off, the structure remains stable, paving an avenue for further post-synthetic treatment.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of computed partial charges toward basis set and (exchange-)correlation treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial charges are a central concept in general chemistry and chemical biology, yet dozens of different computational definitions exist. In prior work [M. Cho et al., \textit{ChemPhysChem} {\bf 21}, 688-696 (2020)], we showed that these can be reduced to at most three `principal components of ionicity'. The present study addressed the dependance on computed partial charges $q$ on 1-particle basis set and (for WFT methods) $n$-particle correlation treatment or (for DFT methods) exchange-correlation functional, for several representative partial charge definitions such as QTAIM, Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I, HLY (electrostatic), NPA, and APT. Our findings show that semi-empirical double hybrids can closely approach the CCSD(T) `gold standard' for this property. In fact, owing to an error compensation in MP2, CCSD partial charges are further away from CCSD(T) than is MP2. The non-local correlation is important, especially when there is a substantial amount of non-local exchange. Employing range separation provides no clear advantage, while global hybrids with 20-30\% Hartree-Fock exchange exhibit the best performance across all charge types. Basis set convergence analysis shows that an augmented triple-zeta haVTZ+d basis set is sufficient for Hirshfeld, Hirshfeld-I, HLY, and APT methods. In contrast, QTAIM and NPA display slower basis set convergence. It is noteworthy that for both NPA and QTAIM, HF exhibits the slowest basis set convergence when contrasted with the correlation components of MP2 and CCSD. Triples corrections in CCSD(T), denoted as CCSD(T)-CCSD, exhibit even faster basis set convergence.</description>

      <title>GradNav: Accelerated Exploration of Potential Energy Surfaces with Gradient-Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of molecular systems' potential energy surface is important for comprehending their complex behaviors, particularly through identifying various metastable states. However, the transition between these states is often hindered by substantial energy barriers, demanding prolonged molecular simulations that consume considerable computational efforts. Our study introduces the GradNav algorithm, which enhances the exploration of the energy surface, accelerating the reconstruction of the potential energy surface (PES). This algorithm employs a strategy of initiating short simulation runs from updated starting points, derived from prior observations, to effectively navigate across potential barriers and explore new regions. To evaluate GradNav's performance, we introduce two metrics: the deepest well escape frame (DWEF) and the search success initialization ratio (SSIR). Through applications on Langevin dynamics within Mueller-type potential energy surfaces and molecular dynamics simulations of the Fs-Peptide protein, these metrics demonstrate GradNav's enhanced ability to escape deep energy wells, as shown by reduced DWEF values, and its reduced reliance on initial conditions, highlighted by increased SSIR values. Consequently, this improved exploration capability enables more precise energy estimations from simulation trajectories.</description>

      <title>General theory of the viscosity of liquids and solids from nonaffine particle motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for particle-bath atomistic motion. The derivation is done within the framework of nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed matter systems from molecular simulations without having to fit long-time tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the vibrational density of states of the system, and the zero-frequency limit of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in LiH and LiD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the ab-initio electron density beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in crystalline LiH and LiD with density functional methods. We report significant beyond Born-Oppenheimer corrections to electron density in the vicinity of nuclei equilibrium positions. We thus verify the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, as earlier suggested on experimental grounds. A reasonable agreement between the experimental and computational results is found. The results indicate the existence of beyond Born-Oppenheimer effects in solids at normal pressures and suggest that these effects can be significant also in solids containing elements other than hydrogen as well.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>
