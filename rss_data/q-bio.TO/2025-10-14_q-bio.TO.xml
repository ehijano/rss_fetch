      <title>Understanding the interplay of collagen and myocyte adaptation in cardiac volume overload: a multi-constituent growth and remodeling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical stretches, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&amp;R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&amp;R.</description>

      <title>The IBEX Imaging Knowledge-Base: A Community Resource Enabling Adoption and Development of Immunofluoresence Imaging Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) Knowledge-Base is a central portal for researchers adopting IBEX and related 2D and 3D immunofluorescence imaging methods. The design of the Knowledge-Base is modeled after efforts in the open-source software community and includes three facets: a development platform (GitHub), static website, and service for data archiving. The Knowledge-Base facilitates the practice of open science throughout the research life cycle by providing validation data for recommended and non-recommended reagents, such as primary and secondary antibodies. In addition to reporting negative data, the Knowledge-Base empowers method adoption and evolution by providing a venue for sharing protocols, videos, datasets, software, and publications. A dedicated discussion forum fosters a sense of community among researchers while addressing questions not covered in published manuscripts. Together, scientists from around the world are advancing scientific discovery at a faster pace, reducing wasted time and effort, and instilling greater confidence in the resulting data.</description>
