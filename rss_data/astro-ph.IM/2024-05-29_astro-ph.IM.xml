Abstract: Gravitational lensing occurs as the path of light from distant celestial bodies is distorted due to gravitational attraction by other celestial bodies, whose mass is partly invisible, being so-called dark matter. When observed through a gravitational lens, distant galaxies appear distorted. A lot of research activity goes into mapping the dark matter in the universe through graviational lensing. However, the mathematical models are complicated, and calculations both time consuming and tideous, if manual. In this paper we discuss how we may combine the Roulette formalism due to Clarkson with machine learning for automatic, local estimation of the lense potential in strong lenses. We also present a framework of open source software for generating datasets and validating results.

  Gravitasjonslinsing er fenomenet der ljos fr{\aa} fjerne himmellegeme vert avb{\o}ygd av tyngdekraften fr{\aa} andre himmellegeme, som ofte ikkje er fullt synlege fordi mykje av massen er m{\o}rk materie. Observert gjennom ei gravitasjonslinse, framst{\aa}r fjerne galaksar som forvrengde. Der er mykje forskingsaktivitet som freistar {\aa} karleggja m{\o}rk materie ved {\aa} studera linseeffektar, men dei matematiske modellane er kompliserte og utrekningane krev i dag mykje manuelt arbeide som er sv{\ae}rt tidkrevjande. I denne artikkelen dr{\o}ftar me korleis me kan kombinera rouletteformalismen {\aa}t Chris Clarkson med maskinl{\ae}ring for automatisk, lokal estimering av linsepotentialet i sterke linser, og me presenterer eit rammeverk med programvare i open kjeldekode for {\aa} generera datasett og validera resultat.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Clock-Induced Charge Production in the EMCCD Gain Register</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) is often used for taking images with space telescopes and other devices. Photons hit the pixels and photo-electrons are created, and these are multiplied via impact ionization as they travel through the gain register from one gain stage to the next. A high gain means a high multiplication factor, and this is achieved through a high voltage difference across a gain stage. If the gain is high enough, the chance of clock-induced charge production in the gain register increases. The probability distribution function governing the gain process in the literature only accounts for charge multiplication if one or more electrons enters the gain register. I derive from first principles the modified probability distribution that accounts for clock-induced charge production in the gain register. I also examine some EMCCD data and show through maximum likelihood estimation that the data conform better to the modified distribution versus the usual one in the literature. The use of the modified distribution would in principle improve the accuracy of signal extraction from a frame.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error in 21-centimeter Global Spectrum Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21 cm line signal is a powerful probe of the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. The global spectrum can potentially be detected with a single antenna and spectrometer. However, this measurement requires an extremely accurate calibration of the instrument to facilitate the separation of the 21 cm signal from the much brighter foregrounds and possible variations in the instrument response. Understanding how the measurement errors propagate in a realistic instrument system and affect system calibration is the focus of this work. We simulate a 21 cm global spectrum observation based on the noise wave calibration scheme. We focus on how measurement errors in reflection coefficients affect the noise temperature and how typical errors impact the recovery of the 21 cm signal, especially in the frequency domain. Results show that for our example set up, a typical vector network analyzer (VNA) measurement error in the magnitude of the reflection coefficients of the antenna, receiver, and open cable, which are 0.001, 0.001, and 0.002 (linear), respectively, would result in a 200 mK deviation on the detected signal, and a typical measurement error of 0.48 degree, 0.78 degree, or 0.15 degree in the respective phases would cause a 40 mK deviation. The VNA measurement error can greatly affect the result of a 21 cm global spectrum experiment using this calibration technique, and such a feature could be mistaken for or be combined with the 21 cm signal</description>

      <title>Improving mid-infrared thermal background subtraction with Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based large-aperture telescopes, interferometers, and future Extremely Large Telescopes equipped with adaptive-optics systems provide angular resolution and high-contrast performance that are superior to space-based telescopes at thermal-infrared wavelengths. Their sensitivity, however, is critically limited by the high thermal background inherent to ground-based observations in this wavelength regime. We aim to improve the subtraction quality of the thermal-infrared background from ground-based observations, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We use data obtained with the Nulling-Optimized Mid-Infrared Camera on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer as a proxy for general high-sensitivity, AO-assisted ground-based data. We apply both a classical background subtraction -- using the mean of dedicated background observations -- and a new background subtraction based on a PCA of the background observations. We compare the performances of these two methods in both high-contrast imaging and aperture photometry. Compared to the classical background subtraction approach, PCA background subtraction delivers up to two times better contrasts down to the diffraction limit of the LBT's primary aperture (i.e., 350 mas in N band), that is, in the case of high-contrast imaging. Improvement factor between two and three are obtained over the mean background retrieval within the diffraction limit in the case of aperture photometry. PCA background subtraction significantly improves the sensitivity of ground-based thermal-infrared imaging observations. When applied to LBTI's nulling interferometry data, we expect the method to improve the sensitivity by a similar factor 2-3. This study paves the way to maximising the potential of future infrared ground-based instruments and facilities, such as the future 30m-class telescopes.</description>

      <title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program VII. Stress Testing the NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the JWST NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that: (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but non-ideal effects (e.g., flat field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing sub-pixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ~1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Followup Could Have Enabled the Discovery of the GW190425 Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it. We analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425 and find that while the gravitational-wave localization uncertainty was large, most of the 90% probability region could have been covered within hours had the search been coordinated. Instead, more than 5 days after the merger, the uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. We further show that, according to some models, it would have been possible to detect the GW190425 kilonova, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize the importance of coordinating followup of gravitational-wave events, not only to avoid missing future kilonovae, but also to discover them early. Such coordination, which is especially important given the rarity of these events, can be achieved with the Treasure Map, a tool developed specifically for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference of the neutron star equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven background model for the CUORE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the model we developed to reconstruct the CUORE radioactive background based on the analysis of an experimental exposure of 1038.4 kg yr. The data reconstruction relies on a simultaneous Bayesian fit applied to energy spectra over a broad energy range. The high granularity of the CUORE detector, together with the large exposure and extended stable operations, allow for an in-depth exploration of both spatial and time dependence of backgrounds. We achieve high sensitivity to both bulk and surface activities of the materials of the setup, detecting levels as low as 10 nBq kg$^{-1}$ and 0.1 nBq cm$^{-2}$, respectively. We compare the contamination levels we extract from the background model with prior radio-assay data, which informs future background risk mitigation strategies. The results of this background model play a crucial role in constructing the background budget for the CUPID experiment as it will exploit the same CUORE infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here, we identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they introduce strong confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular perspective of physics.</description>

      <title>The impact of gravitational waveform model systematics on the measurement of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars with theoretical model predictions reveals important information about the sources, such as the masses and the distance to the stars. The latter can be used to determine the Hubble Constant, the rate at which the Universe expands. One general problem of all astrophysical measurements is that theoretical models only approximate the real underlying physics, which can lead to systematic uncertainties introducing biases. However, the extent of this bias for the distance measurement due to uncertainties of gravitational waveform models is unknown. In this study, we analyze a synthetic population of 38 binary neutron star sources measured with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo at design sensitivity. We employ a set of four different waveform models and estimate model-dependent systematic biases on the extraction of the Hubble Constant using the bright siren method. Our results indicate that systematic biases are below statistical uncertainties for the current generation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>SubDLe: identification of substructures in cosmological simulations with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of substructures within halos in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations is a fundamental step to identify the simulated counterparts of real objects, namely galaxies. For this reason, substructure finders play a crucial role in extracting relevant information from the simulation outputs. They are based on physically-motivated definitions of substructures, performing multiple steps of particle-by-particle operations, thus computationally expensive. The purpose of this work is to develop a fast algorithm to identify substructures in simulations. The final aim, besides a faster production of subhalo catalogues, is to provide an algorithm fast enough to be applied with a fine time-cadence during the evolution of the simulations. We chose to apply the architecture of a well known Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, to the identification of substructures within the mass density field of the simulation. We have developed SubDLe (Substructure identification with Deep Learning), an algorithm which combines a 3D generalization of U-Net and a Friends-of-Friends algorithm, and trained it to reproduce the identification of substructures performed by the SubFind algorithm in a set of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. For the feasibility study presented in this work, we have trained and tested SubDLe on galaxy clusters at $z=0$, using a NVIDIA P100 GPU. We focused our tests on the version of the algorithm working on the identification of purely stellar substructures, stellar SubDLe. Our stellar SubDLe is capable of identifying the majority of galaxies in the challenging high-density environment of galaxy clusters in short computing times. This result has interesting implications in view of the possibility of integrating fast subhalo finders within simulation codes, that can take advantage of accelerators available on state-of-art computing nodes.</description>

      <title>NotPlaNET: Removing False Positives from Planet Hunters TESS with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiating between real transit events and false positive signals in photometric time series data is a bottleneck in the identification of transiting exoplanets, particularly long-period planets. This differentiation typically requires visual inspection of a large number of transit-like signals to rule out instrumental and astrophysical false positives that mimic planetary transit signals. We build a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to separate eclipsing binaries and other false positives from potential planet candidates, reducing the number of light curves that require human vetting. Our CNN is trained using the TESS light curves that were identified by Planet Hunters citizen scientists as likely containing a transit. We also include the background flux and centroid information. The light curves are visually inspected and labeled by project scientists and are minimally pre-processed, with only normalization and data augmentation taking place before training. The median percentage of contaminants flagged across the test sectors is 18% with a maximum of 37% and a minimum of 10%. Our model keeps 100% of the planets for 16 of the 18 test sectors, while incorrectly flagging one planet candidate (0.3%) for one sector and two (0.6%) for the remaining sector. Our method shows potential to reduce the number of light curves requiring manual vetting by up to a third with minimal misclassification of planet candidates.</description>

Abstract: The radio astronomy community is rapidly adopting deep learning techniques to deal with the huge data volumes expected from the next generation of radio observatories. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a principled way to model uncertainty in the predictions made by such deep learning models and will play an important role in extracting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on their outputs. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different BNNs against the following criteria: predictive performance, uncertainty calibration and distribution-shift detection for the radio galaxy classification problem.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: JWST/NIRCam observations of the young giant planet $\beta$ Pic b</title>

Abstract: We present the first JWST/NIRCam observations of the directly-imaged gas giant exoplanet $\beta$ Pic b. Observations in six filters using NIRCam's round coronagraphic masks provide a high signal-to-noise detection of $\beta$ Pic b and the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic over a wavelength range of $\sim$1.7-5 $\mu$m. This paper focuses on the detection of $\beta$ Pic b and other potential point sources in the NIRCam data, following a paper by Rebollido et al. which presented the NIRCam and MIRI view of the debris disk around $\beta$ Pic. We develop and validate approaches for obtaining accurate photometry of planets in the presence of bright, complex circumstellar backgrounds. By simultaneously fitting the planet's PSF and a geometric model for the disk, we obtain planet photometry that is in good agreement with previous measurements from the ground. The NIRCam data supports the cloudy nature of $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere and the discrepancy between its mass as inferred from evolutionary models and the dynamical mass reported in the literature. We further identify five additional localized sources in the data, but all of them are found to be background stars or galaxies based on their color or spatial extent. We can rule out additional planets in the disk midplane above 1 Jupiter mass outward of 2 arcsec ($\sim$40 au) and away from the disk midplane above 0.05 Jupiter masses outward of 4 arcsec ($\sim$80 au). The inner giant planet $\beta$ Pic c remains undetected behind the coronagraphic masks of NIRCam in our observations.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a silicon-based 6U Cubesat detector for soft $\gamma$-ray astronomy</title>

Abstract: The observation of the low-energy $\gamma$-ray (0.1-30 MeV) sky has been significantly limited since the COMPTEL instrument was decommissioned aboard the Compton Gamma-ray Observer (CGRO) satellite in 2000. The exploration of $\gamma$-ray photons within this energy band, often referred to as the \say{MeV gap}, is crucial to address numerous unresolved mysteries in high-energy and multi-messenger astrophysics. Although several large MeV $\gamma$-ray missions have been proposed (e.g., e-ASTROGAM, AMEGO, COSI), most of these are in the planning phase, with launches not expected until the next decade, at the earliest. Recently, there has been a surge in proposed CubeSat missions as cost-effective and rapidly implementable \say{pathfinder} alternatives. A MeV CubeSat payload dedicated to $\gamma$-ray astronomy could serve as a valuable demonstrator for large-scale future MeV payloads. This paper proposes a $\gamma$-ray payload design with a Silicon-based tracker and a Ceasium-Iodide-based calorimeter. We report the results of a simulation study to assess the performance of this payload concept and compare the results with those of previous $\gamma$-ray instruments. As part of the performance assessment and comparison, we show that with our proposed payload design, a sensitivity better than IBIS can be achieved for energies between 0.1 and 10 MeV, and for energies up to around 1 MeV, the achieved sensitivity is comparable to COMPTEL, therefore opening up a window towards cost-effective observational astronomy with comparable performance to past missions.</description>

      <title>First results of axion dark matter search with DANCE</title>

Abstract: Axions are one of the well-motivated candidates for dark matter, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in particle physics. Dark matter Axion search with riNg Cavity Experiment (DANCE) is a new experimental project to broadly search for axion dark matter in the mass range of $10^{-17}~\mathrm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$. We aim to detect the rotational oscillation of linearly polarized light caused by the axion-photon coupling with a bow-tie cavity. The first results of the prototype experiment, DANCE Act-1, are reported from a 24-hour observation. We found no evidence for axions and set 95% confidence level upper limit on the axion-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma} \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ in $10^{-14}~\mathrm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{-13}~\mathrm{eV}$. Although the bound did not exceed the current best limits, this optical cavity experiment is the first demonstration of polarization-based axion dark matter search without any external magnetic field.</description>
