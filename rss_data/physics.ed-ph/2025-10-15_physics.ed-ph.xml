      <title>Experimental Skills for Non-PhD Roles in the Quantum Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) workforce grows, there is an anticipated need for professionals with bachelor's and master's degrees who can fill a wide range of roles in the quantum industry. This report identifies the experimental skills needed for individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees to succeed in quantum industry roles. Through semi-structured interviews with quantum industry employers, we gathered data on 22 distinct positions spanning hardware, software, and business functions. While employers describe varying expectations of quantum expertise, the unifying requirement across these roles is proficiency in experimental skills, which fall into four key categories: instrumentation, computation and data analysis, experimental and project design, as well as communication and collaboration. Positions open to bachelor's and master's graduates use all four skill areas, but the balance of experimental skill set needed differs. Bachelor's roles lean toward instrumentation, computation and data analysis, as well as experimental and project design skills. Individuals in these roles build, operate, and troubleshoot hardware, and they gather and interpret data to design and carry out experiments. Master's roles stand out with the communication and collaboration skills needed on top of the other three skill categories. Individuals in these roles oversee experiments, coordinate teams, and align efforts with company and client needs. By articulating experimental skills needed for bachelor's and master's roles in the quantum industry, this report provides actionable insights for educators developing QISE courses and programs.</description>

      <title>How often does unguided peer interaction lead to correct response consensus? An example from Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigated the impact of peer collaboration and changes from individual to group performance of graduate students on the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) without any guidance from the instructor. We define construction of knowledge as a case in which the group answered the question correctly but in the individual administration of the survey before the group work, one member gave the correct answer and the other gave incorrect answer. We find that there was a significant improvement in the performance of students after peer interaction, which was mostly attributed to construction of knowledge. However, students had very few opportunities to co-construct knowledge as there were hardly any situations in which neither student in a group provided a correct answer. We analyzed the effect size for improvement from individual to group scores for each CSEM item to understand the characteristics of these questions that led to productive group interaction. We also compared the group performance of the graduate students to the introductory physics students in a prior study using the CSEM to get insight into the concepts that showed differences for the two groups and those that were challenging for both groups of students before and after collaboration with peers. Our findings can motivate physics instructors to incorporate group interactions both inside and outside of the classroom even without instructor's involvement so that students at all levels can learn from each other and develop a functional understanding of the underlying concepts.</description>

      <title>What we talk about when we talk about physics problem solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I am a second-year cognitive science major, and as a student who has completed my physical science distribution requirements, I will likely never again encounter Gauss's law. So why do I feel that the time and effort I devoted to solving Gauss's law problems was worth it? Partly, I simply enjoy learning and the new perspective on the physical world that comes from understanding electromagnetism. But I was also fascinated by how physics problems train the mind in effective problem-solving strategies -- of course I was, being a cognitive science major! Two themes emerged as I reflected on this realization. First, physics problems serve as toy models for more complex problems outside of physics, cultivating broadly transferable problem-solving skills. Second, the process of solving physics problems invites reflection on our own cognitive and affective processes. These themes are deeply interconnected. A richer metacognitive understanding of our minds enables us to tackle more complex problems, while engaging with increasingly challenging problems, in turn, deepens our self-understanding. In what follows, Professor Zosia Krusberg and I consider nine general lessons offered by the physics problem-solving process.</description>

      <title>Reliable generation of isomorphic physics problems using Generative AI with prompt-chaining and tool use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for generating large numbers of isomorphic physics problems using generative AI services such as ChatGPT, through prompt chaining and tool use. This approach enables precise control over structural variations-such as numeric values and spatial relations-while supporting diverse contextual variations in the problem body. By utilizing the Python code interpreter, the method supports automatic solution validation and simple diagram generation, addressing key limitations in existing LLM-based methods. We generated two example isomorphic problem banks and compared the outcome against two simpler prompt-based approaches. Results show that prompt-chaining produces significantly higher quality and more consistent outputs than simpler, non-chaining prompts. We also show that GenAI services can be used to validate the quality of the generated isomorphic problems. This work demonstrates a promising method for efficient and scalable problem creation accessible to the average instructor, which opens new possibilities for personalized adaptive testing and automated content development.</description>
