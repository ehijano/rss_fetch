      <title>DSR transformations with zero time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In doubly special relativity (DSR) theories the speed of the light usually depends on the frequency. Thus, we expect that light from very distant stars and gamma ray bursts have additional time delays with respect to special relativity. In this paper, we will find the general DSR transformations in the first order of the Planck length which have zero time delay. With respect to these transformations zero time delay isn't only a consequence of special relativity, and we can find some DSR theories which behave like special relativity in the first order of the Planck length in some aspects. We notify that for a correct conclusion in the observations of the quantum gravity effects we should look to all quantum gravity effects together and not one.</description>

      <title>A simple model of magnetic universe without singularity associated with a quadratic equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of magnetic universe based on nonlinear electrodynamics has been introduced by Kruglov. This model describes an early inflation era followed by a radiation era. We show that this model is related to our model of universe based on a quadratic equation of state. We discuss two quantitatively different models of early universe. In Model I, the primordial density of the universe is identified with the Planck density. At $t=0$, the universe had the characteristics of a Planck black hole. During the inflation, which takes place on a Planck timescale, the size of the universe evolves from the Planck length to a size comparable to the Compton wavelength of the neutrino. If we interpret the radius of the universe at the end of the inflation (neutrino's Compton wavelength) as a minimum length related to quantum gravity and use Zeldovich's first formula of the vacuum energy, we obtain the correct value of the cosmological constant. In Model II, the primordial density of the universe is identified with the electron density as a consequence of nonlinear electrodynamics. At $t=0$, the universe had the characteristics of an electron. During the inflation, which takes place on a gravitoelectronic timescale, the size of the universe evolves from the electron's classical radius to a size comparable to the size of a dark energy star of the stellar mass. If we interpret the radius of the universe at the begining of the inflation (electron's classical radius) as a minimum length related to quantum gravity and use Zeldovich's second formula of the vacuum energy, we obtain the correct value of the cosmological constant. This provides an accurate form of Eddington relation between the cosmological constant and the mass of the electron. We also introduce a nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian that describes simultaneously the early inflation, the radiation era, and the dark energy era.</description>

      <title>Local Hamiltonian dynamics from non-local action principles and applications to binary systems in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>

      <title>Virial identities across the spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virial-like identities obtained through Derrick's scaling argument are powerful, multi-purpose tools to study general relativistic models. Applications comprise establishing no-go/hair theorems and numerical accuracy tests. In the presence of a horizon (\textit{aka} boundary), the spacetime can be divided into regions, each with its own identity. So far, such identities have only been computed in the region outside the event horizon; however, adding a positive cosmological constant endows an additional boundary (the cosmological horizon), with the region between the latter and the former of particular interest. In this letter, by performing a radial coordinate transformation, we generalise Derrick's scaling argument to compute virial identities \textit{across the whole} non-asymptotically flat spacetimes. The developed method is applied to the entire Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter spacetime. A convenient gauge that trivialises the gravitational contribution to the identity between horizons is also found.</description>

      <title>Coronagraphic time-delay interferometry: characterization and updated geometric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be a space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detector to be launched in the next decade. Central to LISA data analysis is time-delay interferometry (TDI), a numerical procedure which drastically reduces otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise. LISA data analysis is usually performed on sets of TDI variables, e.g. Michelson variables $(X, Y, Z)$ or quasiorthogonal variables $(A, E, T)$. We investigate a less standard TDI variable denoted $\kappa$ which depends on time, or frequency, and two parameters $(\beta, \lambda)$. This so-called coronagraphic TDI variable has the singular property of canceling GW signal when $(\beta, \lambda)$ tend to the sky position of the GW source. Thanks to this property, coronagraphic TDI has the potential to be an efficient model-agnostic method for sky localization of GW sources with LISA. Those characteristics make it relevant for low-latency searches and a possible glitch veto. Although briefly discussed in the literature, coronagraphic TDI has only been tested on theoretical grounds. In this paper we validate the applicability of $\kappa$ to sky localization of typical LISA sources, namely Galactic binaries (GBs) and massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), when considering a simplified LISA instrument. The goal of this paper is to pave the way for applications of coronagraphic TDI to practical LISA data analysis problems.</description>

      <title>Shadows, Quasinormal Modes, and Optical Appearances of Black Holes in Horndeski Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of photons in black hole (BH) spacetimes within the framework of Horndeski theory, focusing on quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the optical appearances of BHs surrounded by thin accretion disks. We analyze photon motion, derive the effective potential and photon sphere radius, and calculate QNMs using the WKB method and the eikonal limit. Using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of $\mathrm{M} 87^*$ and $\mathrm{Sgr} \mathrm{A}^*$, we constrain the parameter $-0.46 \lesssim \gamma \lesssim 0.31$ within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval, providing limits on Horndeski gravity. Additionally, we establish the frequency ranges of the fundamental mode for $\mathrm{M} 87^*$ and $\mathrm{Sgr} \mathrm{A}^*$ as $2.4 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 2.7 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{Hz}$ and $3.6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 4.1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{Hz}$, respectively. We further explore the optical appearances of these BHs, highlighting the dependence on emission characteristics and demonstrating that the current EHT resolution primarily captures direct emission. This work advances our understanding of BH shadows and constrains Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Solar system consistency of $f(R)$ gravity theory and its MOND equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since last two decades $f(R)$ gravity theory has been extensively used as a serious alternative of general relativity to mimic the effects of dark energy. The theory presents a Yukawa correction to Newtonian gravitational potential, acting as a fifth force of Nature. Generally speaking, this new force is mediated by a scalar field known as scalaron. It affects orbital dynamics of test bodies around a central mass. When the scalaron becomes extremely massive $f(R)$ gravity reduces to Newtonian theory in the weak field limit. In this paper we test $f(R)$ gravity theory in the Solar system by constraining scalaron mass through existing measurements of perihelion shift of planets, Cassini's measurement of the Parameterised Post Newtonian parameter and measurement of the Brans-Dicke coupling constant. We calculate acceleration due to gravity in the theory for planets, Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs), Centaurs, Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs) and Oort cloud objects and compare it with the values predicted by Newtonian and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). It is found that the theory reproduces to MOND like acceleration in the outer Solar system ($r_p \sim 2000$ au - $36000$ au) for available interpolating functions of the MOND paradigm. From its MOND equivalence we constrain the parameters of the theory. Our results are consistent with existing constraints on the theory arising from the environment of the Galactic Centre black hole.</description>

      <title>Echoes and quasi-normal modes of perturbations around Schwarzchild traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the waveforms and quasi-normal modes around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes under different field perturbations, including the scalar field perturbation, the electromagnetic (vector) field perturbation and the gravitational (tensor) field perturbation. By comparing Schwarzschild traversable wormholes with Schwarzschild black holes, we find some unique properties for the former. At first, the perturbation waveform includes echoes and damping oscillations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it has only the damping waveform around Schwarzschild black holes. Secondly, the difference between adjacent peaks of echoes varies with the mass parameter and the defect parameter in the waveform around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it always keeps constant around Schwarzschild black holes. Thirdly, the ordinary isospectrality between the odd and even parities no longer exists in the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, but an alternative isospectrality appears. According to these properties, we summarize a scenario for estimating the mass parameter and the defect parameter of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes through the waveforms and quasi-normal modes. Our analyses provide a more profound comprehension of the inherent characteristics of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous projective coordinates for the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in homogeneous projective coordinates, because it is then possible to write all transformations of such a group in a manifestly linear way. The 2-sphere metric, Bondi-Metzner-Sachs metric, asymptotic Killing vectors, generators of supertranslations, as well as boosts and rotations of Minkowski spacetime, are all re-expressed in homogeneous projective coordinates. Last, the integral curves of vector fields which generate supertranslations are evaluated in detail. This work prepares the ground for more advanced applications of the differential geometry of asymptotically flat spacetimes in projective coordinates.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the transitions epochs in cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two transition periods in cosmology: radiation-to-matter and matter-to-dark energy. In each case, we define a new parameter $\chi$ given by the ratios of the two energy densities involved in the transition. Our study of the second epoch is motivated by the need to understand cosmic acceleration. Assuming a dynamic dark energy is the driving force for cosmic acceleration, we formulate a new equation of state for the dark energy given in terms of the ratio $\chi$ and the deceleration parameter, $q$. We have analysed the resultant system of equations, where we vary different parameters and examine the effect on the universe's evolution. For cosmic acceleration to occur, the EoS of the dynamic dark energy must lie in the interval $-1&lt;\omega&lt;-2/3$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is a space mission that has recently entered the implementation phase. The main goal of LISA is to survey, for the first time, the observable universe by detecting low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). One of the main GW sources that LISA will detect is the coalescence and merger of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to the detection and parameter estimation of MBHBs signals in the LISA data. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which typically relies on the assumptions of Gaussianity and stationarity of the noise and requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations (noise + MBHB). Since the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. One key aspect of the method is the compression of the data. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from standard techniques and discuss the differences that appear, some of which can be identified as caused by the loss of information from the data compression we use. We also discuss future improvements to this method.</description>

      <title>Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+\alpha) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow on the screen decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $\alpha$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical backward ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of black holes in modified gravity, their observational signatures, and constraints.</description>

      <title>Cosmological models based on an asymmetric scalar doublet with kinetic coupling of components. II. Numerical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of a mathematical model of the cosmological evolution of an asymmetric scalar doublet with kinetic interaction between the components was carried out. A wide range of values of fundamental parameters and initial conditions of the model are considered. Various types of behavior have been identified: models with an infinite inflationary past and future - with and without a rebound point, models with a finite past and infinite future, with an infinite past and finite future (Big Rip), as well as models with a finite past and future. Based on numerical analysis, the behavior of models near the initial singularity and the Big Rip is studied; it is shown that in both cases the barotropic coefficient tends to unity, which corresponds to an extremely rigid state of matter near singularities. A numerical example of the cosmological generation of the classical component of a scalar doublet by its phantom component is given. An assessment was made of the creation of the velocity of fermion pairs by a scalar field near the rebound points and it was shown that a scalar field at the cold stage of the Universe can ensure the creation of the required number of massive scalarly charged fermions. Keywords: cosmological model, phantom and classical scalar fields, quality analysis, asymptotic behavior, numerical modelling, scalar field generation, types of behavior.</description>

      <title>Rotating reduced Kiselev black holes: Shadows, Energy emission and Deflection of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generate a rotating solution of the reduced Kiselev black hole through the Newman-Janis formalism. Based on such solution, we remark different shadow behaviors by varying the involved parameters $r_k, a, \alpha$. Concretely, we observe that the allowed values of the spin parameter $a$ are much less than the usual rotating black holes. By deeply analysing the shadow shapes, we show that comparable shadow shapes emerge for the same ratio $a/r_k$. On the other hand, we recognize that the parameters $a$ and $\alpha$ governs the shadow geometry while the parameter $r_k$ rules the size of such a quantity. Besides, we notice that an elliptic shadow geometry appears for certain range of relevant parameters. By making contact with the observational side, we provide a constraint on the rotating reduced Kiselev (RRK) black hole parameters. In particular, we find a good compatibility between the theoretical and experimental results. Regarding Hawking radiation, we note that the Kiselev radius $r_ k$ shows a similar behavior to the quintessence filed intensity $\mathbf{c}$. Concerning the light motion in the vicinity of a RRK black hole, we investigate deeply the deflection by varying the relevant parameters. In particular, we remark that such a quantity decreases by increasing the parameters $a$ and $\alpha$ while the opposite effect is observed when increasing $r_k$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constant as an integration constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider theories constructed from the derivatives of the Einstein equation, in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. We focus on theories that can be written as a Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and remark on a recent debate regarding the viability of Cotton gravity; we find that while the Codazzi equation is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to $\lambda g_{ab}$ on generic backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the divergence-free condition can in principle close the system for an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations with respect to all variables are considered) for the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector.</description>

Abstract: We study spherically symmetric static solutions of the most general sixth-derivative gravity using series expansions. Specifically, we prove that the only solutions of the complete theory (i.e., with generic coupling constants) that possess a Frobenius expansion around the origin, $r=0$, are necessarily regular. When restricted to specific branches of theories (i.e., imposing particular constraints on the coupling constants), families of potentially singular solutions emerge. By expanding around $r=r_0 \neq 0$, we identify solutions with black-hole horizons. Finally, we argue that, unlike in fourth-derivative gravity, the conditions $R=0$ and $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ are too restrictive for sixth-derivative gravity solutions.</description>

      <title>A Study of Black Holes and Beyond: Shadows and Relativistic Orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter introduces readers to the formation of black holes and naked singularities as an end state of continuous gravitational collapse. The physical and geometrical properties of the Schwarzschild black hole, JMN-1 naked singularity, and JNW naked singularity are summarised. The motivation and objectives to be derived are based on the literature reviews. The second chapter deals with the shadows of the mentioned compact objects. The equations of motion are explicitly calculated for general spherically symmetric and static spacetimes using the ray-tracing formalism and the null geodesics. The third chapter focuses on the construction of rotating naked singularity using the NJA. The NJA is used without complexification method and obtain rotating JNW naked singularity spacetime. The general formalism of the shadow shape is derived for rotating spacetime and obtain the shadow shapes for the rotating JNW, Kerr and deformed Kerr spacetimes. In the fourth chapter, the precession of timelike-bound orbits is investigated in the Schwarzschild, JMN-1, and JNW spacetimes. The fully relativistic orbit equations are derived for the provided models. The approximate solutions of the orbit equations are used to characterize the nature of orbital precession. The next chapter is on the precession of timelike bound orbits in the rotating Kerr and JNW spacetimes. The sixth chapter deals with the relativistic orbits of S-stars and discusses the orbital parameters of the real and apparent orbits. Astrometric data of the S2 star has been adopted from the available literature and use numerical techniques to study the relativistic orbits of the S2 star in the presence of a scalar field. The final chapter aims at summarising the results followed by some futuristic scopes that probe the nature of Sgr A* with a possible black hole mimicker.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Wormholes Beyond Classical General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, only Static Spherically Symmetric space-times in four dimensions are considered within modified gravity models. The non-singular static metrics, including black holes not admitting a de Sitter core in the center and traversable wormholes, are reconsidered within a class of higher-order $F(R)$, satisfying the constraints $F(0)=\frac{dF}{dR}(0)=0$. Furthermore, by making use of the so-called effective field theory formulation of gravity, the quantum corrections to Einstein-Hilbert's action due to higher-derivative terms related to curvature invariants are investigated. In particular, in the case of Einstein-Hilbert action plus cubic curvature Goroff-Sagnotti contribution, the second-order correction in the Goroff-Sagnotti coupling constant is computed. In general, it is shown that the effective metrics, namely Schwarzschild expression plus small quantum corrections, are related to black holes and not to traversable wormholes. In this framework, within the approximation considered, the resolution of singularity for $r=0$ is not accomplished. The related properties of these solutions are investigated.</description>

      <title>On a reconstruction procedure for special spherically symmetric metrics in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model: the Schwarzschild metric test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4D gravitational model with a real scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms is considered. The action contains the potential $U(\varphi)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$. For a special static spherically symmetric metric $ds^2 = (A(u))^{-1} du^2 - A(u) dt^2 + u^2 d\Omega^2$, with $A(u) &gt; 0$ ($u &gt; 0$ is a radial coordinate), we verify the so-called reconstruction procedure suggested by Nojiri and Nashed. This procedure presents certain implicit relations for $U(\varphi)$ and $f(\varphi)$ which lead to exact solutions to the equations of motion for a given metric governed by $A(u)$. We confirm that all relations in the approach of Nojiri and Nashed for $f(\varphi(u))$ and $\varphi(u)$ are correct, but the relation for $U(\varphi(u))$ contains a typo which is eliminated in this paper. Here we apply the procedure to the (external) Schwarzschild metric with the gravitational radius $2 \mu $ and $u &gt; 2 \mu$. Using the ``no-ghost'' restriction (i.e., reality of $\varphi(u)$), we find two families of $(U(\varphi), f(\varphi))$. The first one gives us the Schwarzschild metric defined for $u &gt; 3 \mu$, while the second one describes the Schwarzschild metric defined for $2 \mu &lt; u &lt; 3 \mu$ ($3 \mu$ is the radius of the photon sphere). In both cases the potential $U(\varphi)$ is negative.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Glitch Subtraction Systems for Enhancing Gravitational Wave Data Analysis: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glitches are transitory noise artifacts that degrade the detection sensitivity and accuracy of interferometric observatories such as LIGO and Virgo in gravitational wave astronomy. Reliable glitch subtraction techniques are essential for separating genuine gravitational wave signals from background noise and improving the accuracy of astrophysical investigations. This review study summarizes the main glitch subtraction methods used in the industry. We talk about the efficacy of classic time-domain techniques in real-time applications, like matched filtering and regression methods. The robustness of frequency-domain approaches, such as wavelet transformations and spectral analysis, in detecting and mitigating non-stationary glitches is assessed. We also investigate sophisticated machine learning methods, demonstrating great potential in automatically identifying and eliminating intricate glitch patterns. We hope to provide a thorough understanding of these approaches' uses, difficulties, and potential for future development in gravitational wave data analysis by contrasting their advantages and disadvantages. Researchers looking to enhance glitch subtraction procedures and raise the accuracy of gravitational wave detections will find great value in this paper.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological applications for interacting matters, an extension of the action functional for relativistic fluids is proposed to incorporate the physics of non-adiabatic processes and chemical reactions. The former are characterised by entropy growth, while the latter violate particle number conservation. The relevance of these physics is demonstrated in the contexts of self-interacting fluids, fluids interacting with scalar fields, and hyperhydrodynamical interactions with geometry. The possible cosmological applications range from early-universe phase transitions to astrophysical phenomena, and from matter creation inflationary alternatives to interacting dark sector alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM model that aim to address its tensions. As an example of the latter, a single fluid model of a unified dark sector is presented. The simple action of the model features one field and one parameter, yet it can both reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and predict new phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KerrGeoPy is a Python package which computes both stable and plunging timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime using analytic solutions to the geodesic equation that are written in terms of Legendre elliptic integrals. It mirrors and builds upon much of the functionality of the KerrGeodesics Mathematica library. Users can construct a geodesic by providing the initial position and four-velocity, or by providing either the constants of motion or a generalized version of the parameters defining a Keplerian orbit. The package provides methods for computing the four-velocity, fundamental frequencies, and constants of motion associated with a given geodesic along with the location of the separatrix. It also includes several methods for visualizing and animating geodesics.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in shift-symmetric theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative theories of gravity may be put to the test by making use of gravitational wave observations. Scalar-tensor theories provide a relatively simple framework that allows for compact object solutions with characteristics different from those of their GR counterparts. In shift-symmetric theories, black hole hair may arise when a linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant is introduced. The effect of this coupling on the black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) has been shown to be small, therefore limiting the observational interest in the theory. In general, however, one expects that additional shift-symmetric terms in the Lagrangian may be relevant, and indeed, it has been shown that they can have a nontrivial impact on the mass and scalar charge of the stationary solutions. In this work we explore the effect that various such terms have on the axial and polar QNMs of the hairy black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of a minimally coupled tachyonic scalar field at inflection points in an accelerating universe. We consider the different expansion factors and obtain potentials of tachyonic scalar field. Inflection points of homogeneous tachyonic scalar field is calculated for these potentials.

      <description>arXiv:2405.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both black hole thermodynamics and finite volume effects in quantum field theory violate the null energy condition. Motivated by this, we compare thermodynamic features between two 1+1-dimensional systems: (i) a scalar field confined to a periodic spatial interval of length $a$ and tunneling between two degenerate vacua; (ii) a dilatonic black hole at temperature $T$ in the presence of matter fields. If we identify $a\propto T^{-1}$, we find similar thermodynamic behaviours, which suggests some deeper connection arising from the presence of non-trivial boundary conditions in both systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17396v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with exponential $f(R)$ gravity models with axion as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both non-supersymmetric model with heavy right handed neutrino decay and supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both the cases, we have shown that the required baryonis asymmetry could be obtained and also have shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number violating model parameters are contrained with $\beta$ through decoupling temperature. Upper bound on $\beta$ parameter is also obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the Laplacian of an $n$-Riemannian manifold $X$, the Weyl law states that the $k$-th eigenvalue is asymptotically proportional to $(k/V)^{2/n}$, where $V$ is the volume of $X$. We show that this result can be derived via physical considerations by demanding that the gravitational potential for a compactification on $X$ behaves in the expected $(4+n)$-dimensional way at short distances. In simple product compactifications, when particle motion on $X$ is ergodic, for large $k$ the eigenfunctions oscillate around a constant, and the argument is relatively straightforward. The Weyl law thus allows to reconstruct the four-dimensional Planck mass from the asymptotics of the masses of the spin 2 Kaluza--Klein modes. For warped compactifications, a puzzle appears: the Weyl law still depends on the ordinary volume $V$, while the Planck mass famously depends on a weighted volume obtained as an integral of the warping function. We resolve this tension by arguing that in the ergodic case the eigenfunctions oscillate now around a power of the warping function rather than around a constant, a property that we call weighted quantum ergodicity. This has implications for the problem of gravity localization, which we discuss. We show that for spaces with D$p$-brane singularities the spectrum is discrete only for $p =6,7,8$, and for these cases we rigorously prove the Weyl law by applying modern techniques from RCD theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ''overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Mapping and Factorising Cosmological Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction that characterises the state of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a simple yet novel duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion. The duality manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry in the correspondence between correlators and the physical parts of wavefunction coefficients. To demonstrate the power of the duality already at tree-level, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations are in principle testable as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics (i.e. without performing any analytic continuation or taking any soft limits). For $n=4$, the CCF formula provides a relation between the parity-odd part of the trispectrum of curvature perturbations, the bispectra involving two curvature perturbations and an additional state with a complementary series mass and integer spin, and the power spectrum of this additional state.</description>

      <title>Formation and decay of oscillons after inflation in the presence of an external coupling, Part-I: Lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and decay of oscillons during the post-inflationary reheating epoch from inflaton oscillations around asymptotically flat potentials $V(\varphi)$ in the presence of an external coupling of the form $\frac{1}{2}\, g^2 \, \varphi^2 \, \chi^2$. It is well-known that in the absence of such an external coupling, the attractive self-interaction term in the potential leads to the formation of copious amounts of long-lived oscillons both for symmetric and asymmetric plateau potentials. We perform a detailed numerical analysis to study the formation of oscillons in the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-model potentials using the publicly available lattice simulation code ${\cal C}$osmo${\cal L}$attice. We observe the formation of nonlinear oscillon-like structures with the average equation of state $\langle w_\varphi\rangle \simeq 0$ for a range of values of the inflaton self-coupling $\lambda$ and the external coupling $g^2$. Our results demonstrate that oscillons form even in the presence of an external coupling and we determine the upper bound on $g^2$ which facilitates oscillon formation. We also find that eventually, these oscillons decay into the scalar inflaton radiation as well as into the quanta of the offspring field $\chi$. Thus, we establish the possibility that reheating could have proceeded through the channel of oscillon decay, along with the usual decay of the oscillating inflaton condensate into $\chi$ particles. For a given value of the self-coupling $\lambda$, we notice that the lifetime of a population of oscillons decreases with an increase in the strength of the external coupling, following an (approximately) inverse power-law dependence on $g^2$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon$+$SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering a well motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. From the Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region which excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 4.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations, indicating that the proposed model would alleviate the apparent tension. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduce the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforces the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>High priority targets for transient gravitational waves from glitching pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glitching pulsars are expected to be important sources of gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore six different models that propose the emission of transient continuous waves, lasting days to months, coincident with glitches. The maximal gravitational wave energy is calculated for each model, which is then used to determine whether associated gravitational waves could be detectable with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O4 detectors. We provide an analytical approximation to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio which includes information about the source's sky position, improving on previous estimates that assume isotropic or sky and orientation averaged sensitivities. Applying the calculation to the entire glitching population, we find that certain models predict detectable signals in O4, whereas others do not. We also rank glitching pulsars in order of how significant a signal would be, based on archival data, and we find that for all models, the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) would provide the strongest signal. Moreover, PSR J0537$-$6910 is not expected to yield a detectable signal in O4, but will start becoming relevant for next generation detectors. Our analysis also extends to the entire pulsar population, regardless of whether they have glitched or not, and we provide a list of pulsars that would present a significant signal, if they were to glitch. Finally, we apply our analysis to the latest April 2024 Vela glitch and find that a signal should be detectable under certain models. The non-detection of a supposedly detectable signal would provide an efficiency factor that quantifies how much a model can contribute to gravitational wave emission, eventually leading to a differentiation of models and independent constraints on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Residual neural networks to classify the high frequency emission in core-collapse supernova gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a detailed study on the detectability of the High Frequency Feature (HFF) in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational wave (GW) signals. We applied Residual Neural Networks (ResNet50), one of the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in computer vision, to perform a multi-class classification of image samples built from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms of LIGO-Virgo noise plus CCSN GW signals. We consider three target labels for three consecutive and mutually exclusive intervals in which the (first-order) slope of the HFF can be located. We optimized, trained, and tested the ResNet50 model with phenomenological waveforms. Next, we tested the optimized ResNet50 model with GW signals from CCSN simulations. At galactic distances of $1$Kpc and $5$Kpc with H1 and L1 data and $1$Kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from $0.8933$ to $0.9867$), which show the feasibility of our methodology. In the case of further distances, we observed declines in test performance until $0.8000$ with H1 and L1 data at $10$Kpc and until $0.5933$ with V1 data at $10$Kpc. Without assuming the continuity and/or discontinuity of the HFF slope values, our methodology is general enough to address, at an early stage, the characterization of the HFF.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the light of DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent result from the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) data release 1 (DR1) combined with the cosmic microwave background and supernova data shows a preference for the dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant [1]. For this analysis, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization of the dark energy equation of state has been used. Though CPL parametrization is the most popular parametrization of dark energy equation of state (EoS) recent studies have questioned its choice of prior and degeneracy. In this work, we propose a new parametrization of the dark energy equation of state motivated by its ability to cross the phantom barrier crossing. At a high redshift limit, this parametrization takes the form of CPL parametrization. We have used the Bayesian model selection criteria in which this parametrisation shows a moderate positive preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model. Contrary to the DESI2024 results our model suggests the current value of the dark energy equation of state to be phantom today with two phantom barrier crossings one at $z\simeq 0.4$ from deep phantom to quintessence which matches with the finding from the DESI2024 result and another phantom barrier crossing very recently at $z\simeq0.1$ from quintessence to phantom. The proposed model also weakens the Hubble tension significantly to $\approx 2 \sigma$ while comparing with the result from [2] and to $\approx 1.4 \sigma$ while comparing with [3].</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, magnetic properties, and global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking of the S-type Gubser-Rocha model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <title>Effects of local cosmic inhomogeneities on the gravitational wave event rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local universe is highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic. We live in a relatively sparse region of the Laniakea supercluster at the edge of a large 80 Mpc-wide void. We study the effect of these inhomogeneities on the measured gravitational wave event rates. In particular, we estimate how the measured merger rate of compact binaries is biased by the local matter distribution. The effect of the inhomogeneities on the merger rate is suppressed by the low angular resolution of gravitational wave detectors coupled with their smoothly decreasing population-averaged sensitivity with distance. We estimate the effect on the compact binary coalescence event rate to be at most 6% depending of the chirp mass of the target binary system and the sensitivity and orientation of the detectors.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that the dissipative properties of superdense matter play a negligible role in modeling gravitational waveforms from neutron star inspirals. This study aims to investigate whether this presumption holds true for the often neglected dissipative process associated with particle diffusion in superconducting neutron stars. As we demonstrate, diffusion effects can significantly impact the phase of the gravitational wave from the inspiral, manifesting at a magnitude of a few tens of milliradians at large orbit separations, equivalent to orbital frequencies of a few hertz. We also find that dissipation resulting from particle diffusion might increase the neutron star's temperature to approximately $10^7\rm K$ during the inspiral.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the initiation of cosmic inflation, in full numerical relativity, from pre-inflationary scenarios with large tensor and vector fluctuations in the metric. These settings are characterized by having large values in the Weyl curvature tensor. In the matter sector, we consider a single scalar field with inhomogeneous field velocities, corresponding to a kination period. In the context of large-field inflation, it is shown that the onset of inflation continues to be robust to this type of initial conditions, and that during inflation the Universe successfully homogenizes and flattens any type of curvature, leading to a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe after just a few tens of efolds of accelerating expansion.</description>

Abstract: In modeling a relativistic disk around a compact object, the self-gravity of the disk is often neglected while it needs to be incorporated for more accurate descriptions in several circumstances. Extending the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu self-consistent field method, we present numerical models of a rapidly rotating neutron star with a self-gravitating disk in stationary equilibrium. In particular, our approach allows us to obtain numerical solutions involving a massive disk with the rest mass $O(10^{-1})-O(10^0) M_\odot$ closely attached to a rotating neutron star. We also assess the impact of self-gravity on the internal structure of the disk and the neutron star. These axisymmetric, stationary solutions can be employed for simulations involving the neutron star-disk system in the context of high-energy transients and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate a sufficient condition for blowup of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with arbitrarily positive initial energy in Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. This is accomplished using an established concavity method that has been employed for similar PDEs in Minkowski space. This proof relies on the energy inequality associated with this equation, $E(t_0)\geq E(t)$, also proved herein using a geometric method.</description>

      <title>Discreteness Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly recognized the value of analyzing the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum for investigations into redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical model for the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, designed for RSD analyses. In particular, we emphasize the importance of accounting for discrete effects arising from the reconstruction displacement vector, which have been overlooked. We specifically calculate these discrete effects, i.e., shot noise terms, within the framework of standard perturbation theory at the 1-loop level. In addition, we adopt a formulation that accounts for infrared (IR) effects to accurately model the non-linear damping of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal. Our model comprehensively integrates key physical phenomena relevant to the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, such as gravitational non-linearities, RSD effects, bias effects, reconstruction effects, reconstruction-specific shot-noise effects, and the non-linear damping of the reconstructed BAO signal, thereby making it applicable to post-reconstruction RSD analyses.</description>

Abstract: In the disk-corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we present ZIJI, which is a model to calculate the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries in the disk-corona model. The accretion disk is described by the Novikov-Thorne model. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. The user decides the radial density profile of the accretion disk and the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of ZIJI in different regimes. We discuss current limitations of our model as well as the next steps to improve it.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the transition amplitudes of the Unruh-DeWitt detector within the Schwarzschild spacetime background and discover gravity-induced transparency phenomena akin to the earlier acceleration-induced transparency. This is confirmed through calculations performed in both the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh states. The similarity between free-falling detectors in these states and accelerated detectors in electromagnetic fields is noteworthy, as it parallels the scenario in which acceleration-induced transparency phenomena occur.</description>

      <title>New Fixed Points from Melonic Interactions</title>

Abstract: Generalizations of vector field theories to tensors allow to similarly apply large-$N$ techniques but find a richer though often still tractable structure. However, the potential of such tensor theories has not been fully exploited since only a symmetry-reduced ``isotropic'' part of their phase space has been studied so far. Here we present for the first time the richness of the tensorial phase space applying the functional renormalization group to tensor fields of rank $r$ in the cyclic-melonic potential approximation including the flow of anomalous dimensions. Due to a decoupling of the flow equations of the $r$ couplings at given order, we find non-Gaussian fixed points in any regime of $0&lt;s\le r$ non-vanishing coupling types. Each of these regimes contains isotropic fixed points of Wilson-Fisher type as well as new anisotropic fixed points. This new classification reveals a rich structure of renormalization group dynamics including candidates for asymptotic safe fixed points even at critical dimension. Considering the tensorial interactions as generating discrete geometries, the various fixed points correspond to continuum limits of distinguished ensembles of triangulations raising hope to find new classes of continuum geometry in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many evidences appear in the past decades and show that the negativity of Casimir energy is responsible for exotic mechanical and gravitational effects. We study in this work the Lorentz boost of a Casimir cavity, on which little attention is paid to its momentum in historical works. We find that the vacuum energy and momentum carried by the cavity transform differently from those of point particles due to the cavity's extension feature. However, the mass-shell condition of the two are identical as long as the cavity is finite along the moving direction only.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a large $N$ quantum mechanics of non-abelian bosonic and fermionic variables as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in the matrix model. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>

      <title>New limits on warm inflation from pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs produced by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Cosmological Total Energy Density and Transient Periods in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the Universe is traditionally examined by monitoring how its material content evolves as it expands. This model of an isolated system is expressed as the equation of motion of the bulk but segmented into different epochs. In particular, the evolution of the {\it $Friedmann-Lema\hat{i}tre-Robertson - Walker$} (FRLW) Universe is separated into different epochs that are characterised by the dynamics of whichever mass-energy density constituent is dominant at the time. The standard analysis of the evolution of the Universe in a particular epoch often considers the evolution of the dominant energy density only, disregarding all others. Whereas this represents the limiting case, in principle the contributions from others cannot always be ignored particularly in the vicinity of the equality of the various competing mass-energy densities or the transition periods between epochs. We examine the evolution of the total energy density rather than individual energy densities during the different epochs. We find that taking into account the contributions from the various constituents lead to a broader range of possible evolution histories which enriches the standard picture.</description>

Abstract: Regular black holes are generically unstable because of the classical phenomenon that goes by the name of "mass inflation" which destabilizes the inner horizon. In a recent article, [Phys.Rev.D~107~(2023)~2,~024005], it is argued that semiclassical effects due to Hawking radiation can cure this instability, and some concerns are raised against the validity of previous analyses showing its existence in the first place. In this short comment, we explain our reservations regarding these recent claims, and reiterate the relevance of the mass inflation instability for regular black holes of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>New parametrization of the dark-energy equation of state with a single parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel dark-energy equation-of-state parametrization, with a single parameter $\eta$ that quantifies the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We first confront the scenario with various datasets, from Hubble function (OHD), Pantheon, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and their joint observations, and we show that $\eta$ has a preference for a non-zero value, namely a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is favored, although the zero value is marginally inside the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. However, we find that the present Hubble function value acquires a higher value, namely $ H_0= 66.624^{+0.011}_{-0.013}~Km~ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1} $, which implies that the $H_0$ tension can be partially alleviated. Additionally, we perform a cosmographic analysis, showing that the universe transits from deceleration to acceleration in the recent cosmological past, nevertheless, in the future, it will not result in a de Sitter phase, since it exhibits a second transition from acceleration to deceleration. Finally, we perform the Statefinder analysis. The scenario behaves similarly to the $ \Lambda$CDM paradigm at high redshifts, while the deviation becomes significant at late and recent times and especially in the future.</description>

      <title>Metric perturbations of Kerr spacetime in Lorenz gauge: Circular equatorial orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the metric perturbation in Lorenz gauge for a compact body on a circular equatorial orbit of a rotating black hole (Kerr) spacetime, using a newly-developed method of separation of variables. The metric perturbation is formed from a linear sum of differential operators acting on Teukolsky mode functions, and certain auxiliary scalars, which are solutions to ordinary differential equations in the frequency domain. For radiative modes, the solution is uniquely determined by the $s=\pm2$ Weyl scalars, the $s=0$ trace, and $s=0,1$ gauge scalars whose amplitudes are determined by imposing continuity conditions on the metric perturbation at the orbital radius. The static (zero-frequency) part of the metric perturbation, which is handled separately, also includes mass and angular momentum completion pieces. The metric perturbation is validated against the independent results of a 2+1D time domain code, and we demonstrate agreement at the expected level in all components, and the absence of gauge discontinuities. In principle, the new method can be used to determine the Lorenz-gauge metric perturbation at a sufficiently high precision to enable accurate second-order self-force calculations on Kerr spacetime in future. We conclude with a discussion of extensions of the method to eccentric and non-equatorial orbits.</description>

      <title>Particle production from non-minimal coupling in a symmetry breaking potential transporting vacuum energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an inflationary scenario where the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to spacetime curvature and inflation is driven by a vacuum energy symmetry breaking potential without specifying \emph{a priori} whether the inflaton field is small or large. As we incorporate vacuum energy into our analysis, we further explore the implications of a non-zero potential offset in relation to the emergence of inflationary dynamics. Thus, we propose that vacuum energy can transform into particles as a result of the transition triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This entails a vacuum energy cancellation that yields an effective cosmological constant during inflation by virtue of a quasi-de Sitter evolution and shows that the vacuum energy contribution can manifest as \emph{geometric particles} produced by inflaton fluctuations, with particular emphasis on super-Hubble modes. We conjecture these particles as \emph{quasi-particles} arising from interaction between the inflaton and spacetime geometry, enhanced by non-minimal coupling. Specifically, we propose that dark matter arises from a pure geometric quasi-particle contribution, and we quantify the corresponding dark matter candidate ranges of mass. In this scenario, we further find that a zero potential offset leads to a bare cosmological constant at the end of inflation, while a negative offset would require an additional kinetic (or potential) contribution in order to be fully-canceled. In this regard, we conclude that the scenario of large field inflaton is preferred since it necessitates a more appropriate selection of the offset. Our conclusion is reinforced as small field inflaton would lead to a significant screening of the Newtonian gravitational constant as inflation ends.</description>

      <title>Impact of Bayesian Priors on the Inferred Masses of Quasi-Circular Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observation of gravitational waves from inspiralling binary black holes has offered a unique opportunity to study the physical parameters of the component black holes. To infer these parameters, Bayesian methods are employed in conjunction with general relativistic waveform models that describe the source's inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The results depend not only on the accuracy of the waveform models but also on the underlying fiducial prior distribution used for the analysis. In particular, when the pre-merger phase of the signal is barely observable within the detectors' bandwidth, as is currently the case with intermediate-mass black hole binary signals in ground-based gravitational wave detectors, different prior assumptions can lead to different interpretations. In this study, we utilise the gravitational-wave inference library, $\texttt{Parallel Bilby}$, to evaluate the impact of mass prior choices on the parameter estimation of intermediate-mass black hole binary signals. While previous studies focused primarily on analysing event data, we offer a broader, more controlled study by using simulations. Our findings suggest that the posteriors in total mass, mass ratio and luminosity distance are contingent on the assumed mass prior distribution used during the inference process. This is especially true when the signal lacks sufficient pre-merger information and/or has inadequate power in the higher-order radiation multipoles. In conclusion, our study underscores the importance of thoroughly investigating similarly heavy events in current detector sensitivity using a diverse choice of priors. Absent such an approach, adopting a flat prior on the binary's redshifted total mass and mass ratio emerges as a reasonable choice, preventing biases in the detector-frame mass posteriors.</description>

Abstract: In this comment on arXiv:2308.07360 it is pointed out that though the authors raise an important question on the prevailing presentations of the unimodular gravity their own presentation is incomplete as well as confusing equating assumptions to misconceptions. We focus on the notion of diffeomorphism invariance, general covariance and the conservation/nonconservation of the energy-momentum tensor in this short note to delineate the fundamental issues in unimodular gravity. The present discussion is intended to offer a wider and deeper perspective on the objective set by the authors in their paper.</description>

      <title>Black-Body Radiation in a Uniformly Accelerated Frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Planck's radiation law in a uniformly accelerated frame expressed in Rindler coordinates. The black-body spectrum is time-dependent by its temperature and Planckian at each instantaneous time, but it is scaled by an emissivity factor that depends on the Rindler spatial coordinate and the acceleration magnitude. The observer in an accelerated frame will perceive the black-body as black, hyperblack, or grey, depending on its position with respect to the source (moving away or towards), the acceleration magnitude, and the case of whether it is accelerated or decelerated. For an observer accelerating away from the source, there exists a threshold on the acceleration magnitude beyond which it stops receiving radiation from the black-body. Since the frequency and the number of modes in Planck's law evolve over time, the spectrum is continuously red or blue-shifted towards lower (or higher) frequencies as time progresses, and the radiation modes (photons) could be created or annihilated, depending on the observer's position and its acceleration or deceleration relative to the source of radiation.</description>

      <title>New models of d-dimensional black holes without inner horizon and with an integrable singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretically, it has been proposed that objects traveling radially along regular black holes (RBHs) would not be destroyed because of finite tidal forces and the absence of a singularity. However, the matter source allows the creation of an inner horizon linked to an unstable de Sitter core due to mass inflation instability. This inner horizon also gives rise to the appearance of a remnant, inhibiting complete evaporation. We introduce here a $d$-dimensional black hole model with Localized Sources of Matter (LSM), characterized by the absence of an inner horizon and featuring a central integrable singularity instead of an unstable de Sitter core. In our model, any object tracing a radial and timelike world-line would not be crushed by the singularity. This is attributed to finite tidal forces, the extendability of radial geodesics, and the weak nature of the singularity. Our LSM model enables the potential complete evaporation down to $r_h=0$ without forming a remnant. In higher dimensions, complete evaporation occurs through a phase transition, which could occur at Planck scales and be speculatively driven by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Unlike RBHs, our model satisfies the energy conditions. We demonstrate a linear correction to the conventional area law of entropy, distinct from the RBH's correction. Additionally, we investigate the stability of the solutions through the speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Are $f(R, {\rm Matter})$ theories really relevant to cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine $f(R, \text{Matter})$ theories that directly couple the curvature $R$ or $R_{\mu\nu}$ with the matter sector in the action, in addition to the universal coupling. We argue that if the matter sector includes the Standard Model (SM), such theories are either inconsistent or already excluded by experiments unless they are a rewriting of $f(R)$ gravity or general relativity. If these theories genuinely couple the SM to curvature, they suffer from the presence of ghost states at energies within their domain of application for cosmological purposes. Therefore, we raise questions about their relevance to cosmology. Moreover, if such theories do not include the SM, they should just be seen as scalar-tensor, vector-tensor, ..., theories, depending on the additional degrees of freedom. They should thus be studied accordingly.}</description>

      <title>Braneworlds in Warped Einsteinian Cubic Gravity</title>

Abstract: Einstenian cubic gravity (ECG) is a modified theory of gravity constructed with cubic contractions of the curvature tensor. This theory has the remarkable feature of having the same two propagating degrees of freedom of Einstein gravity (EG), at the perturbative level on maximally symmetric spacetimes. The additional unstable modes steaming from the higher order derivative dynamics are suppressed provided that we consider the ECG as an effective field theory wherein the cubic terms are seen as perturbative corrections of the Einstein-Hilbert term. Extensions of ECG have been proposed in cosmology and compact objects in order to probe if this property holds in more general configurations. In this work, we construct a modified ECG gravity in a five dimensional warped braneworld scenario. By assuming a specific combination of the cubic parameters, we obtained modified gravity equations of motion with terms up to second-order. For a thin 3-brane, the cubic-gravity corrections yield an effective positive bulk cosmological constant. Thus, in order to keep the 5D bulk warped compact, an upper bound of the cubic parameter with respect to the bulk curvature was imposed. For a thick brane, the cubic-gravity terms modify the scalar field potential and its corresponding vacuum. Nonetheless, the domain-wall structure with a localized source is preserved. At the perturbative level, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensor gravitational modes are stable and possess a localized massless mode provided the cubic corrections are small compared to the EG braneworld.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present for the first time a Friedmann-like construction in the framework of an osculating Finsler-Randers-Sasaki geometry. In particular, we consider a vector field in the metric on a Lorentz tangent bundle, and thus the curvatures of horizontal and vertical spaces, as well as the extra contributions of torsion and non-linear connection, provide an intrinsic richer geometrical structure, with additional degrees of freedom, that lead to extra terms in the field equations. Applying these modified field equations at a cosmological setup we extract the generalized Friedmann equations for the horizontal and vertical space, showing that we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the richer underlying structure of the tangent bundle. Additionally, as it is common in Finsler-like constructions, we obtain an effective interaction between matter and geometry. Finally, we consider a specific model and we show that it can describe the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, and that the dark-energy equation of state can lie in the quintessence or phantom regimes, or cross the phantom divide.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis in non-minimal symmetric-teleparallel dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify the symmetric-teleparallel dark energy through the addition of a further Yukawa-like term, in which the non-metricity scalar, $Q$, is non-minimally coupled to a scalar field Lagrangian where the phion acts as quintessence, describing dark energy. We investigate regions of stability and find late-time attractors. To do so, we conduct a stability analysis for different types of physical potentials describing dark energy, namely the power-law, inverse power-law, and exponential potentials. Within these choices, we furthermore single out particular limiting cases, such as the constant, linear and inverse potentials. For all the considered scenarios, regions of stability are calculated in terms of the signs of the coupling constant and the exponent, revealing a clear degeneracy among coefficients necessary to ensure stability. We find that a generic power-law potential with $\alpha &gt; 0$ is not suitable as a non-minimal quintessence potential and we put severe limits on the use of inverse potential, as well. In addition, the equations of state of each potential have been also computed. We find the constant potential seems to be favored than other treatments, since the critical point appears independent of the non-minimal coupling.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic gravity and its regularization of Locally Signed Coordinate Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect the final theory of gravity to have more symmetries than we suspect and our research points in this direction. To start with, standard general coordinate invariance can be extended to complex holomorphic general coordinate transformations. This is possible by introducing a non Riemannian Measure of integration (NRMI) and where we avoid the non holomorphic standard
  $\sqrt{-g}$ measure of integration. Second, locally signed coordinate transformations where the Jacobian changes sign locally but the Jacobian approaches one asymptotically should be symmetries of Nature. This is unlike globally signed transformations that produce a change of boundary conditions, like in the cases of global parity and global time reversal, which are not symmetries of Nature. The holomorphic extension can regularize the regions of space time where the Jacobian changes sign. Consequences for Quantum Gravity are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and observer-dependent quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The proper value of the photon gravitational interferometric relative phase shift is calculated and its full quantum-general relativistic nature is demonstrated. It is shown its observation will falsify the validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of the Einstein equivalence principle beyond a single point (even in the weak uniform gravitational field.)</description>

Abstract: The inflationary scenario, which states that the early universe underwent a brief but dramatic period of accelerated spatial expansion, has become the current paradigm of early universe cosmology. Although inflationary cosmology has its many successes, it does not (as of yet) have the status of an established physical theory. In this paper, we provide mathematical support for the inflationary scenario in a class of anisotropic spacetimes by generalizing the work in [21]. These anisotropic spacetimes satisfy certain initial conditions so that they are perfectly isotropic at the big bang but become less isotropic as time progresses. The resulting inflationary eras are a consequence of the initial conditions which force the energy-momentum tensor to be dominated by a cosmological constant at the big bang.</description>

      <title>Development of generic no-scale inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study tidal forces in the Schwarzschild black hole whose metric includes explicitly a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) effect. We also investigate interesting features of the geodesic equations and tidal effects dependent on the GUP parameter $\alpha$ related to a minimum length. Then, by solving geodesic deviation equations explicitly with appropriate boundary conditions, we show that $\alpha$ in the effective metric affects both the radial and angular components of the geodesic equation, particularly near the singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Influence of Geometrical Deformation on Photon Sphere and Shadow Radius: A New Analytical Approach -- Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to study the behavior of the photon sphere and shadow radius. Our method uses extended gravitational decoupling and reveals two important analytic results. First, the additional matter field alters the photon sphere radius: it increases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&gt;0$ and decreases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&lt;0$ (where $g'$ represents the derivative of a specific metric function evaluated at the original photon sphere radius). Second, the presence of the matter field can modify the black hole shadow size. If $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&gt;0$, the shadow shrinks, while it grows for $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&lt;0$. These findings provide a deeper insight into how matter distribution influences the characteristics of black holes and their observable features. Through a systematic framework and various illustrative examples, our investigation not only clarifies these fundamental aspects but also significantly enhances the theoretical framework of black hole astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-roll inflation with non-minimally kinetic coupling to the Einstein tensor. With the slow-roll parameter $\eta_\phi = -\ddot{\phi}/(H\dot{\phi})$ being a constant, we calculate the power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations, and derive the expressions for the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, the tensor spectral tilt $n_T$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We find that the expressions for $n_s$ are different with different ordering of taking the derivative of the scalar power spectrum with respect to the scale $k$ and the horizon crossing condition $c_sk=aH$ in the constant-roll inflation, the consistency relation $r=-8n_T$ does not hold if $|\eta_\phi|$ is not small, and the duality of the tensor-to-scalar ratio between the slow-roll inflation and ultra-slow-roll inflation does not exist in inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling. The result offers a fresh perspective on the understanding of the inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling and is helpful for the production of scalar induced gravitational waves in the framework of ultra-slow-roll inflation with non-minimally derivative coupling.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Asymptotic Safety Inflation in Gravity Rainbow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using suitable Renormalization Group (RG) based re-summation of quantum corrections to $R^2$ term, a re-summed version of the effective Lagrangian can be obtained \cite{Demmel:2015oqa}. In the context of gravity as an Asymptotically Safe (AS) theory, authors of Refs.\cite{Liu:2018hno,Koshelev:2022olc} proposed a refined Starobinsky model, $L_{\rm AS} = M^{2}_{p} R/2+(\alpha/2)R^{2}/[1+\beta \ln(R/\mu^{2})]$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants and $\mu$ is an energy scale. In the present work, we embed this underlying effective Lagrangian within the framework of gravity's rainbow. By implementing the COBE normalization and the Planck constraint on the scalar spectrum, we demonstrate that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation relies on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, as well as on a rainbow parameter. Similarly, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ is influenced by $\beta$ and the rainbow parameter, yet remains unaffected by $\alpha$. Additionally, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ solely depends on the rainbow parameter. Remarkably, when requiring $n_s$ to be consistent with the Planck collaboration at $1\sigma$ confidence level, the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r &lt; 0.036$ can be naturally satisfied. This value potentially holds promise for potential measurement by Stage IV CMB ground experiments and is certainly within reach of future dedicated space missions.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations of black hole shadows have revolutionized our ability to probe gravity in extreme environments. This manuscript presents a novel analytic method to calculate, in leading-order terms, the key parameters of photon sphere and shadow radius. This method offers advantages for complex metrics where traditional approaches are cumbersome. We further explore the impact of black hole mass on the photon sphere radius, providing insights into black hole interactions with their surroundings.

Abstract: A new exact magnetized solution describing a Kiselev black hole immersed in a magnetic field is used for studying the dynamics of charged particles. For a weak magnetic induction, we employ a first-order perturbative approach to analyze the perturbed circular orbits near the minimum of the effective potential. We obtain an approximate solution for the bounded equatorial trajectory subjected to small radial and latitudinal oscillations. The shape of the trajectory localized near the stable circular orbit depends on the relation between the attractive gravitational force and the repulsive quintessence contribution.</description>

Abstract: A general organizing principle is proposed that can be used to derive the equations of motion describing the near-equilibrium dynamics of causal and thermodynamically stable relativistic systems. The latter are found to display some new type of universal behavior near equilibrium that allows them to be grouped into universality classes defined by their degrees of freedom, information content, and conservation laws. The universality classes expose a number of surprising equivalences between different theories, shedding new light on the near-equilibrium behavior of relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a formalism that was recently developed in a companion paper, we rigorously prove the equivalence, in the linear regime, of a number of apparently different relativistic hydrodynamic theories proposed in the literature. In particular, we show that Hydro+ is indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory for bulk viscosity, which in turn is indistinguishable from a reacting mixture. The two-fluid model for superfluidity coincides with the Israel-Stewart theory for heat conduction in the limit of infinite conductivity, and this explains why the latter has a second sound. Also, MIS$^*$ is equivalent to the Burgers model for viscoelasticity, and this implies that the former must exhibit an elastic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we show that if the degrees of freedom and the conservation laws of a hydrodynamic theory have the same geometric character as those of the Israel-Stewart theory, then such theory must be indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory in the linear regime. This explains why all second-order theories turn out to be identical near equilibrium. Finally, we construct the first linearized model for a relativistic supersolid that is proven to be causal, stable, and strongly hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. Unitarity in QFTCS is essential for formulating S-matrix and computing scattering amplitudes in curved spacetime. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that {time} is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) which offer a way to achieve unitarity. Our framework for a QFTCS is built on a refined understanding of standard QFT S-matrix that explicitly reflects the \cpt\, invariance of scattering amplitudes. We rewrite the standard QFT equipped with a direct-sum Fock space structure that is explicitly $\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$, invariant. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then discuss defining an S-matrix in de Sitter spacetime that is analogous to Minkowski. Furthermore, we comment briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach for quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Cylindrical gravitational waves are interesting because they enjoy an infinite dimensional symmetry called Geroch symmetry. In this paper, we compute the 2-particle tree-level S-matrix for cylindrical gravitational waves. The model we use is a dimensional reduction of general relativity to two spacetime dimensions. The reduced theory is a nonlinear sigma model. We discuss an SO(2) symmetry of the amplitudes which is a special case of Geroch symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the physics of second-order gravitational waves (GWs) induced by scalar-tensor perturbation interactions in the radiation-dominated Universe. We investigate the distinctive signatures of these GWs and their detectability compared to scalar-induced GWs. Unlike scalar-scalar induced GWs, scalar-tensor induced GWs do not present resonances or a logarithmic running in the low frequency tail in the case of peaked primordial spectra. But, interestingly, they partly inherit any primordial parity violation of tensor modes. We find that chirality in primordial GWs can lead to distinguishing effects in scalar-tensor induced GWs in the ultraviolet (UV) region. We also address a potential divergence in our GWs and explore possible solutions. This study contributes to our understanding of GWs in the early Universe and their implications for cosmology and GWs detection.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved space-time: the case of Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct-sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, DQFT leads to the BH evaporation involving only pure states. This means the quantum mechanical effects at the BH horizon produce two components of a maximally entangled pure state in superselection sector Hilbert spaces. This construction enables pure states to evolve into pure states, restoring unitarity and observer complementarity. Finally, we discuss how our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Searching for local features in primordial power spectrum using genetic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for exploring local features directly in the primordial power spectrum using a genetic algorithm (GA) pipeline coupled with a Boltzmann solver and Cosmic Microwave Background data (CMB). After testing the robustness of our pipeline using mock data, we apply it to the latest CMB data, including Planck 2018 and CamSpec PR4. Our model-independent approach provides an analytical reconstruction of the power spectra that best fits the data, with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm exploring a functional space built off simple ``grammar'' functions. We find significant improvements upon the simple power-law behaviour, by $\Delta \chi^2 \lesssim -21$, consistently with more traditional model-based approaches. These best-fits always address both the low$\ell$ anomaly in the TT spectrum and the residual high$\ell$ oscillations in the TT, TE and EE spectra. The proposed pipeline provides an adaptable tool for exploring features in the primordial power spectrum in a model-independent way, providing valuable hints to theorists for constructing viable inflationary models that are consistent with the current and upcoming CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes without fine-tuning from a light stochastic spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that avoids any dependence on specific inflationary features or exotic physics. In this scenario, the required large curvature fluctuations leading to PBH formation are generated after inflation by the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic spectator field during inflation, when this field transiently dominates the energy density. We calculate the dynamics of such a spectator field during and after inflation, the distribution of induced curvature perturbations and their non-Gaussian tails leading to the copious production of PBHs. For a plateau-like potential, this scenario produces an extended PBH mass distribution with a peak at the solar-mass scale when one takes into account the effects of the thermal history. What is remarkable in this scenario is the absence of parameter fine-tuning. Instead, it invokes an anthropic selection over all the realizations of PBH abundances predicted by the field stochasticity. This scenario offers a novel perspective for the formation of PBHs with minimal ingredients and without the need of fine-tuning. It is amenable to observational tests, notably with the gravitational-wave observations of black hole mergers and of a background at nanoHertz frequency, as recently observed by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter $\to$ de Sitter transition driven by Casimir forces and mitigating tensions in cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, low- and high-redshift observations set off tensions in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ and in the determination of the amplitude of the matter clustering in the late Universe (parameterized by $S_8$). It was recently noted that both these tensions can be resolved if the cosmological constant parametrizing the dark energy content switches its sign at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. However, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) swampland conjecture suggests that the postulated switch in sign of the cosmological constant at zero temperature seems unlikely because the AdS vacua are an infinite distance appart from de Sitter (dS) vacua in moduli space. We provide an explanation for the required AdS $\to$ dS crossover transition in the vacuum energy using the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk. We then use entropy arguments to claim that any AdS $\to$ dS transition between metastable vacua must be accompanied by a reduction of the species scale where gravity becomes strong. We provide a few examples supporting this AdS $\to$ dS uplift conjecture.</description>

      <title>OSIRIS-GR: General relativistic activation of the polar cap of a compact neutron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ab initio global general-relativistic Particle-in-cell (GR-PIC) simulations of compact millisecond neutron star magnetospheres in the axisymmetric aligned rotator configuration. We investigate the role of GR and plasma supply on the polar cap particle acceleration efficiency - the precursor of coherent radio emission - employing a new module for the PIC code OSIRIS, designed to model plasma dynamics around compact objects with fully self-consistent GR effects. We provide a detailed description of the main sub-algorithms of the novel PIC algorithm, including a charge-conserving current deposit scheme for curvilinear coordinates. We demonstrate efficient particle acceleration in the polar caps of compact neutron stars with denser magnetospheres, numerically validating the spacelike current extension provided by force-free models. We show that GR relaxes the minimum required poloidal magnetospheric current for the transition of the polar cap to the accelerator regime, thus justifying the observation of weak pulsars beyond the expected death line. We denote that spin-down luminosity intermittency and radio pulse nullings for older pulsars might arise from the interplay between the polar and outer gaps. Also, narrower radio beams are expected for weaker low-obliquity pulsars.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter solves the final parsec problem of supermassive black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.</description>

      <title>An \'Etude on the Regularization and Renormalization of Divergences in Primordial Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many cosmological observables of interest derive from primordial vacuum fluctuations evolved to late times. These observables represent statistical draws from some underlying quantum or statistical field theoretic framework where infinities arise and require regularization. After subtracting divergences, renormalization conditions must be imposed by measurements or observations at some scale, mindful of scheme and background dependence. We review this process on backgrounds that transition from finite duration inflation to radiation domination, and show how in spite of the ubiquity of scaleless integrals, UV divergences can still be meaningfully extracted from quantities that nominally vanish when dimensionally regularized. In this way, one can contextualize calculations with hard cutoffs, distinguishing between UV and IR scales corresponding to the beginning and end of inflation from UV and IR scales corresponding the unknown completion of the theory and its observables. This distinction has significance as observable quantities cannot depend on the latter although they will certainly depend on the former. One can also explicitly show the scheme independence of the coefficients of UV divergent logarithms. Furthermore, certain IR divergences can be shown to be an artifact of the de Sitter limit and are cured for finite duration inflation. For gravitational wave observables, we stress the need to regularize stress tensors that do not presume a prior scale separation in their construction (as with the standard Isaacson form), deriving an improved stress tensor fit to purpose. We conclude by highlighting the inextricable connection between inferring $N_{\rm eff}$ bounds from vacuum tensor perturbations and the process of background renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropies in the distance-redshift relation of cosmological sources are expected due to large-scale inhomogeneities in the local Universe. When the observed sources are tracing a large-scale matter flow in a general spacetime geometry, the distance-redshift relation with its anisotropies can be described with a geometrical prediction that generalises the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker result. Furthermore, it turns out that a finite set of multipole coefficients contain the full information about a finite-order truncation of the distance-redshift relation of a given observer. The multipoles of the distance-redshift relation are interesting new cosmological observables that have a direct physical interpretation in terms of kinematical quantities of the underlying matter flow. Using light cones extracted from $N$-body simulations we quantify the anisotropies expected in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the observed data. In this observational approach the survey selection implements an implicit smoothing scale over which the effective rest frame of matter is fitted. The perceived anisotropy therefore depends significantly on the redshift range and distribution of sources. We find that the multipoles of the expansion rate, as well as the observer's velocity with respect to the large-scale matter flow, can be determined robustly with our approach.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>
