      <title>Decoupling actions of finite-dimensional Lie groups and of groups of diffeomorphisms in the large deformation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational anatomy, the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework has become a central tool for modeling smooth, invertible transformations between shapes such as curves or landmarks. In this paper, we extend this framework by enriching diffeomorphic deformations with transformations induced by finite-dimensional Lie groups (e.g. isometries, scalings), and we develop a registration model that decouples the actions of these two types of deformation on the shape during the matching process. To achieve this, we consider semidirect products between finite-dimensional groups and groups of diffeomorphisms, endowed with a right-invariant sub-Riemannian structure that give rise to new variational problems for shape registration. By exploiting symmetries and reduction theory, we decouple the contributions of each group throughout the matching process. We further extend the framework to incoroporate anisotropic deformations that preferentially favor certain directions during registration. On the numerical side, we propose an algorithm based on a joint optimization over both deformation groups, in contrast to the standard twostage approach that optimizes first over the finite-dimensional component and then over the diffeomorphic one. Experiments on curves and landmarks demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization improves registration accuracy and more effectively disentangles the contributions of the two deformation groups.</description>

      <title>Adapted connections with skew-torsion on metric $f$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a metric $f$-manifold $(M^{2n+s}, \phi, \xi_i, \eta_j, g)$ satisfying the property $[\xi_i, \xi_j]=0$ for all $i, j\in\{1, \ldots, s\}$ admits a metric connection $\nabla$ with skew-torsion $T$ preserving the structure if and only if each Reeb vector field $\xi_i$ is Killing and the Nijenhuis tensor $N^{(1)}$ is totally skew-symmetric. The connection is then uniquely determined and its torsion 3-form $T$ is given by \[ T=\sum_{i=1}^{s}\eta_{i}\wedge{\rm d}\eta_i+{\rm d}^{\phi}F+N^{(1)}-\sum_{i=1}^{s}(\eta_{i}\wedge(\xi_i\lrcorner N^{(1)}))\,, \] where ${\rm d}^{\phi}F:=-{\rm d} F\circ\phi$. This provides a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the adapted connections with skew-torsion on almost Hermitian manifolds (case $s=0$) and almost contact metric manifolds (case $s=1$) presented in [FrIv]. We further prove that a contact metric $f$-manifold $(M^{2n+s}, \phi, \xi_i, \eta_j, g)$, also known as an almost $\mathcal{S}$-manifold, admits such a connection if and only if $M^{2n+s}$ is an $\mathcal{S}$-manifold, that is, a normal contact metric $f$-manifold. In this case we show that the torsion 3-form $T$, which is given by $T=\sum_{i=1}^{s}\eta_{i}\wedge{\rm d}\eta_i$, is $\nabla$-parallel. Thus, for $s\geq 2$, we construct a broad new class of geometries with parallel skew-torsion in all dimensions $\geq 4$, both even and odd. These geometries differ from the Sasakian case ($s=1$) also by the fact that their torsion 3-form $T$ is degenerate. We finally describe examples with $s=2$, $s=3$ and $s=4$, relying on the Lie groups ${\mathsf{U}}(2)$ and ${\mathsf{U}}(3)$, and a construction of $\mathcal{S}$-manifolds presented in [DL05]. For the latter case and the case of ${\mathsf{U}}(2)$ we compute the holonomy algebra of the connection $\nabla$ and show that $\nabla$ is an Ambrose-Singer connection, that is, $\nabla T=0=\nabla R^{\nabla}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the smallest positive eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with any compact strongly isotropy irreducible space. We provide an explicit expression for all simply connected cases. Furthermore, every strongly isotropy irreducible space is automatically an Einstein manifold, and we prove for each of them that $E&lt;\lambda_1\leq 16E$, where $E$ denotes the corresponding Einstein constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove a global Pestov identity on the (orthonormal) frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold and deduce similar identities on associated homogeneous fibrations. As a particular example, this provides a concise proof of the Pestov identity on the unit tangent bundle of the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an open Riemann surface $M$, we show that the branch points and the complete ends of finite total curvature of a conformal minimal surface $M\to{\mathbb R}^n$, $n\ge 3$, can be removed by an isotopy through such surfaces. The analogous result holds for null holomorphic curves $M\to{\mathbb C}^n$.</description>

      <title>Exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with b_+ = 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact, oriented, smooth, simply-connected $4$-manifold. The mapping class group of $X$ is defined as the group of smooth isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of $X$. The Torelli group of $X$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of smooth isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms which are continuously isotopic to the identity. We prove that for each $n \ge 10$, the Torelli group of $2\mathbb{CP}^2 \# n \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ surjects to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$. We also prove that the mapping class group of $2 \mathbb{CP}^2 \# 10 \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ is not finitely generated. Our proofs of these results makes use of Seiberg-Witten invariants for $1$-parameter familes of $4$-manifolds and in particular a gluing formula for connected sum families. Since the manifolds we consider have $b_+ = 2$, the chamber structure of the $1$-parameter Seiberg-Witten invariants plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey various notions of symmetry for toric varieties. These notions range from algebraic geometric, complex geometric, representation theoretic, combinatorial, convex geometric, to geometric stability. The main theorem gives the relationship between these notions. While mostly folklore knowledge, this does not seem to be readily available in the literature. Finally, we take the opportunity to give an accessible and simplified proof of Demazure's 1970 structure theorem for the automorphism group of a smooth toric variety, previously considered quite inaccessible.</description>

Abstract: For a symmetric differential on the compact quotient $\Sigma = \mathbb{B}^n / \Gamma$ of the complex unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ by a discrete subgroup $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{B}^n)$, there exists a corresponding weighted $L^2$-holomorphic function on $(\mathbb{B}^n \times \mathbb{B}^n)/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ acts diagonally on $\mathbb{B}^n \times \mathbb{B}^n$. In this paper, we give an explicit description of this correspondence and derive several applications based on its explicit form.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian Poisson integrators are Poisson integrators that admit a modified Hamiltonian. In this article, we illustrate the importance of the existence of a modified Hamiltonian for Poisson integrators in the context of integrable and non-integrable systems. Examples of Hamiltonian systems are provided by Lotka-Volterra dynamics; in order to investigate stability properties of Hamiltonian Poisson integrators on non-integrable systems, we exhibit a non-integrable $5$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and pursue numerical investigations of it.</description>

      <title>Thom's gradient conjecture for parabolic systems and the Yang-Mills and Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [8], the gradient conjecture of R. Thom was proven for gradient flows of analytic functions on Rn. This result means that the secant at a limit point converges, so that the flow cannot spiral forever. Once the trajectory becomes sufficiently close to a critical point, the flow becomes a simple scaling. Their paper is also significant in the number of auxiliary results they prove about the convergence behaviour of gradient flows, on the way to proving their main result. Many gradient flows of interest occur on infinite dimensional function spaces. And of considerable research interest today are geometric flows with a gauge or diffeomorphism symmetry. We show that the corresponding gradient conjecture holds also for parabolic flows on Hilbert spaces, including flows with a gauge symmetry such as the extensively studied Yang-Mills Flow. The same result also holds for the Ricci flow near any critical point where the assumptions are satisfied, in particular a Fredholm Hessian and a Lojasiewicz inequality with respect to an appropriately chosen functional. This version contains some small improvements on the original 2021 paper.</description>

Abstract: We give an algebraic criterion for a nilpotent real Lie algebra and prove that it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the associated nilpotent Lie group to admit left-invariant Ricci solitons, called nilsolitons. As an application of this result, we generalise Nikolayevsky's criterion for the existence of nilsolitons to nilpotent Lie algebras without nice bases. We further prove a modified version of the Taketomi--Tamaru conjecture for nilpotent Lie groups which gives an obstruction to the existence of nilsolitons.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent planes and (non-)removable singularities at infinity for collapsed translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that mean curvature flow translators may exhibit non-removable singularities at infinity, due to jump discontinuities in their asymptotic profiles, and that oscillation can persist so as to yield a continuum of subsequential limit tangent planes. Nonetheless, we prove that as time $t\to\pm \infty$, any finite entropy, finite genus, embedded, collapsed translating soliton in $\mathbb{R}^3$ converges to a uniquely determined collection of planes.
  This requires global analysis of quasilinear soliton equations with non-perturbative drifts, which we analyze via sharp non-standard elliptic decay estimates for the drift Laplacian, implying improvements on the Evans-Spruck and Ecker-Huisken estimates in the soliton setting, and exploiting a link from potential theory of the Yukawa equation to heat flows with $L^\infty$-data on non-compact slice curves of these solitons.
  The structure theorem follows: such solitons decompose at infinity into standard regions asymptotic to planes or grim reaper cylinders. As one application, we classify collapsed translators of entropy two with empty limits as $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>On two notions of curvature on singular surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the equivalence of two distinct notions of curvature bounds on singular surfaces. The first notion involves inequalities of the form $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ (resp. $\omega\leq\kappa\mu$) where $\omega$ is the curvature measure and $\mu$ the Hausdorff measure. The second notion is the classical Alexandrov curvature bound CBB (resp. CAT). We demonstrate that these two definitions are, in fact, equivalent. Specifically, we fill an important gap in the theory by showing that the inequalities imply the corresponding Alexandrov CBB (resp. CAT) bound. One striking application of our result is that, in combination with a result of Petrunin, the lower bound $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ implies $RCD(\kappa, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorem for biharmonic functions on manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Yau's celebrated Liouville theorem to the biharmonic case. Namely, we show that in a complete Riemannian manifold with a pole, nonnegative Ricci curvature and such that the geodesic spheres centered at the pole are mean-convex (or if the square of the distance function from the pole is convex), any biharmonic function of subquadratic growth must be harmonic, and hence, any biharmonic function of sublinear growth must be constant. Our proof relies on a new local $L^2$ estimate for the Laplacian of biharmonic functions combined with a mean value inequality. Examples where our theorem applies include hypersurfaces of positive sectional curvature in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and manifolds with a pole of nonnegative Ricci curvature whose curvature decays at infinity rapidly enough.</description>

      <title>On $7$-manifolds with $b_{2}=2$: diffeomorphism classification and nonconnected moduli spaces of positive Ricci curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the $s$-invariants of certain simply connected $7$-manifolds whose second homology groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. We apply the $s$-invariants to give a partial classification of simply connected total spaces of circle bundles over $\left(\mathbb{C}P^{1}\times\mathbb{C}P^{2}\right)\#\mathbb{C}P^{3}$ up to diffeomorphism. As an application, we show that there is a simply connected $7$-manifold whose space and moduli space of positive Ricci curvature metrics both have infinitely many path components. We also determine bordism groups $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2}\right)$ and $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2};\mathrm{pr}_{1}^{*}\gamma^{1}\right)$ that are required in the deduction of $s$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$-forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$-forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions studied by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$-forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced and the convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown.</description>

      <title>New asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We disprove the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture, and thus demonstrate that the semi-classical properties of coupled gravitational and electromagnetic fields are more subtle than expected from Lorentzian general relativity, where the Kerr-Newman family of metrics yields the most general stationary and asymptotically flat black holes with a single event horizon. This is achieved by an explicit construction of a new three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. In the case of vanishing charge, these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>Properness and finiteness of totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core of geometrically finite rank-one locally symmetric manifolds. Although the infinite-volume setting can exhibit highly complicated behavior, including geodesic planes with fractal closures, we show that a strong rigidity persists inside the convex core. This rigidity has striking consequences in the infinite volume setting: every maximal totally geodesic submanifold of dimension at least two contained in the convex core is properly immersed and has finite volume, and only finitely many such submanifolds can occur. These results stand in sharp contrast to the behavior in the finite-volume setting. Moreover, combining this finiteness result with the work of Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover and of Gromov-Schoen, we deduce that any geometrically finite rank-one manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two and of finite volume must be arithmetic.</description>
