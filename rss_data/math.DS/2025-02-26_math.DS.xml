      <title>Complexity for billiards in regular N-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complexity of the billiard language of the regular Euclidean $N$-gons (and other families of rational lattice polygons), answering a question posed by Cassaigne-Hubert-Troubetzkoy. Our key technical result is a counting result for saddle connections on lattice surfaces, when we count by combinatorial length.</description>

      <title>Cube structures of the universal minimal system, nilsystems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and develop an approach to studying nilsystems and their proximal extensions using cube structures associated with the universal minimal system. We provide alternative proofs for results regarding saturation properties of factor maps to maximal nilfactors in cubes, as well as new results and applications of independent interest to the structural theory of topological systems. In particular, we give a new proof that $\mathbf{RP}^{[d]}$ is an equivalence relation, building upon the distal case, by establishing a description of this relation in algebraic terms. This is new even for d=1.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spectrum of power-free integers in quadratic number fields and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting dynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the setting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. With respect to the natural patch frequency measure, also known as the Mirsky measure, many of these systems have pure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We calculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group structure, both for a large class of $\mathcal{B}$-free lattice systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and for power-free integers in quadratic number fields. Further, in all cases, the eigenfunctions can be given in closed form, via the Fourier--Bohr coefficients on the dense translation orbit of a generic element. Based on a simple argument via Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers, we show that they are also the eigenfunctions for the unique measure of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>A pointwise ergodic theorem along return times of rapidly mixing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of sparse sequences that are ergodic and pointwise universally $L^2$-good for ergodic averages. That is, sequences along which the ergodic averages converge almost surely to the projection to invariant functions. These sequences are generated randomly as return or hitting times in systems exhibiting a rapid correlation decay. This can be seen as a natural variant of Bourgain's Return Times Theorem. As an example, we obtain that for any $a\in (0,1/2)$, the sequence $\left\{n\in\mathbb{N}:\ 2^ny\mod{1}\in (0,n^{-a})\right\}$ is ergodic and pointwise universally $L^2$-good for Lebesgue almost every $y\in [0,1]$. Our approach builds on techniques developed by Frantzikinakis, Lesigne, and Wierdl in their study of sequences generated by independent random variables, which we adapt to the non-independent case.</description>

      <title>Fractional order induced bifurcations in Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up a system of Caputo-type fractional differential equations for a reduced-order model known as the {\em denatured} Morris-Lecar (dML) neurons. This neuron model has a structural similarity to a FitzHugh-Nagumo type system. We explore both a single-cell isolated neuron and a two-coupled dimer that can have two different coupling strategies. The main purpose of this study is to report various oscillatory phenomena (tonic spiking, mixed-mode oscillation) and bifurcations (saddle-node and Hopf) that arise with variation of the order of the fractional operator and the magnitude of the coupling strength for the coupled system. Various closed-form solutions as functions of the system parameters are established that act as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium point. The theoretical analysis are supported by rigorous numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Ergodicity of Rotation Extensions of Hyperbolic Endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ergodicity of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms, focusing on skew products where the base dynamics are governed by Anosov endomorphisms. For this family, we establish ergodicity and prove that accessibility holds for an open and dense subset. By analyzing the topological implications of accessibility, we demonstrate that conservative accessible partially hyperbolic endomorphisms are topologically transitive. Leveraging accessibility, we further show ergodicity for skew products with $\mathbb{S}^1$-fibers. Finally, although out the context of rotation extensions, we prove ergodic stability results for partially hyperbolic endomorphisms with $\dim(E^c) = 1.$</description>

      <title>Dimensions and entropies under hyperbolic metrics for an expansive homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an expansive homeomorphism, we investigate the relationship among dimension, entropy, and Lyapunov exponents. Motivated by Young's formula for surface diffeomorphisms, which links dimension and measure-theoretic entropy with hyperbolic ergodic measures, we construct the hyperbolic metric with two distinct Lyapunov exponents $\log b&gt;0&gt;-\log a$. We then examine the relationships between various types of entropies (entropy, $r$-neutralized entropy, and $\alpha$-estimating entropy) and dimensions. We further prove the Eckmann-Ruelle Conjecture for expansive topological dynamical systems with hyperbolic metrics. Additionally, we establish variational principles for these entropy quantities.</description>

      <title>On balance properties of hypercubic billiard words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies balance properties for billiard words. Billiard words generalize Sturmian words by coding trajectories in hypercubic billiards. In the setting of aperiodic order, they also provide the simplest examples of quasicrystals, as tilings of the line obtained via cut and project sets with a cubical canonical window.
  By construction, the number of occurrences of each letter in a factor (i.e., a string of consecutive letters) of a hypercubic billiard word only depends on the length of the factor, up to an additive constant. In other words, the difference of the number of occurrences of each letter in factors of the same length is bounded.
  In contrast with the behaviour of letters, we prove the existence of words that are not balanced in billiard words: the difference of the number of occurrences of such unbalanced factors in longer factors of the same length is unbounded. The proof relies both on topological methods inspired by tiling cohomology and on arithmetic results on bounded remainder sets for toral translations.</description>

Additionally, we propose an algorithm to find this weakly reversible deficiency zero network $\mathcal{N}'$ when it exists.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Constrained Aggregative Games over Jointly Connected and Weight-Balanced Switching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The property of the communication network and the constraints on the strategic space are two factors that determine the complexity of the distributed Nash equilibrium (DNE) seeking problem. The DNE seeking problem of aggregative games has been studied for unconstrained case over all types of communication networks and for various types of constrained games over static and connected communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the DNE seeking problem for constrained aggregative games over jointly connected and weight-balanced switching networks, which can be directed and disconnected at every time instant. By integrating the projected gradient technique and the dynamic average consensus algorithm, we convert our problem to the stability problem of a well-defined time-varying nonlinear system. By constructing a time-varying Lyapunov's function candidate for this time-varying nonlinear system, we conduct a rigorous Lyapunov's analysis to conclude the exponential stability of this system and hence solve our problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain orbital counting results for the class of strongly hyperbolic metrics on hyperbolic groups. To achieve this we combine ergodic theoretic techniques involving the Mineyev topological flow and symbolic dynamics. Our results apply to the Green metric associated to an admissible, finitely supported, symmetric random walk and to the Mineyev hat metric. We also describe the domain of analyticity for the Poincar\'e series associated to these metrics, prove mixing results for the Mineyev topological flow and obtain correlation asymptotics for pairs of metrics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dynamical systems from data without time labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the method to reconstruct dynamical systems from data without time labels. Data without time labels appear in many applications, such as molecular dynamics, single-cell RNA sequencing etc. Reconstruction of dynamical system from time sequence data has been studied extensively. However, these methods do not apply if time labels are unknown. Without time labels, sequence data becomes distribution data. Based on this observation, we propose to treat the data as samples from a probability distribution and try to reconstruct the underlying dynamical system by minimizing the distribution loss, sliced Wasserstein distance more specifically. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subshifts are colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. Given a subshift and a finite pattern, its extender set is the set of admissible completions of this pattern. It has been conjectured that the behavior of extender sets, and in particular their growth called extender entropy (arXiv:1711.07515), could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts. We prove here that both classes have the same possible extender entropies: exactly the $\Pi_3$ real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$. We also consider computational properties of extender entropies for subshifts with some language or dynamical properties: computable language, minimal and some mixing properties.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of dynamical systems obtained by coupling an Anosov map on the two-dimensional torus -- the chaotic system -- with the identity map on the one-dimensional torus -- the neutral system -- through a dissipative interaction. We show that the two systems synchronize: the trajectories evolve toward an attracting invariant manifold, and the full dynamics is conjugated to its linearization around the invariant manifold. As a byproduct, we obtain that there exists a unique exponentially mixing physical measure. When the interaction is small, the evolution of the variable which describes the neutral system is very close to the identity; hence, it appears as a slow variable with respect to the variable which describes the chaotic system, and which is wherefore named the fast variable. We demonstrate that, seen on a suitably long time scale, the slow variable effectively follows the solution of a deterministic differential equation obtained by averaging over the fast variable. More precisely, we prove that the invariant manifold is in probability close to the fixed point of the averaged dynamics and that the difference between the exact evolution of the slow variable, seen from the invariant manifold, and its averaged evolution is in probability exponentially decreasing for arbitrarily large times.</description>
