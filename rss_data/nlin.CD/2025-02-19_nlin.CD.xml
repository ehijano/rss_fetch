      <title>Probing Chaos in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: The Role of Black Hole and Cosmological Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of a massless, chargeless particle in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, revealing exponential radial growth and potential chaos in an integrable system. Poincar\'e sections show regular Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori when black hole and cosmological horizons are distant, but distortions and chaos emerge as they converge. As the horizons coincide, the Poincar\'e sections fully contract and vanish, marking the system's transition to Nariai spacetime. \textit{Our analysis also suggests that, within the parameter range explored, the event horizon exerts a comparatively more substantial chaotic influence on the system, primarily due to its consistent proximity.} Additionally, we analyze the Lyapunov exponents to quantify the degree of chaos in the system. Our findings indicate that as the closeness of the two horizons increases, the most prominent Lyapunov exponent also increases, signifying a rise in chaotic behavior. By examining the long-term saturation values of the Lyapunov exponents, we confirm that they consistently comply with the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound.</description>

      <title>Recurrence threshold selection for obtaining robust recurrence characteristics in different embedding dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appropriate selection of recurrence thresholds is a key problem in applications of recurrence quantification analysis and related methods across disciplines. Here, we discuss the distribution of pairwise distances between state vectors in the studied system's state space reconstructed by means of time-delay embedding as the key characteristic that should guide the corresponding choice for obtaining an adequate resolution of a recurrence plot. Specifically, we present an empirical description of the distance distribution, focusing on characteristic changes of its shape with increasing embedding dimension. Our results suggest that selecting the recurrence threshold according to a fixed percentile of this distribution reduces the dependence of recurrence characteristics on the embedding dimension in comparison with other commonly used threshold selection methods. Numerical investigations on some paradigmatic model systems with time-dependent parameters support these empirical findings.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. This approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool, or as part of a broader data-driven analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Non-orthogonal eigenvectors, fluctuation-dissipation relations and entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) linking the response function to time dependent correlations of observables measured in the reference unperturbed state is one of the central results in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Letter we discuss an extension of the standard FDT to the case when multidimensional matrix representing transition probabilities is strictly non-normal. This feature dramatically modifies the dynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvector nonorthogonality via the associated overlap matrix of Chalker-Mehlig type. In particular, the rate of entropy production per unit time is strongly enhanced by that matrix. We suggest, that this mechanism has an impact on the studies of collective phenomena in neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such phenomena as synchronization and emergence of the memory. We also expect, that the described mechanism generating the entropy production is generic for wide class of phenomena, where dynamics is driven by non-normal operators. For the case of driving by a large Ginibre matrix the entropy production rate is evaluated analytically, as well as for the Rajan-Abbott model for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>
