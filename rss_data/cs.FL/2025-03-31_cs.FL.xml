      <title>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series.
  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Sch\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Spatially Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems with Alternating Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) can consist of various networked components and agents interacting and communicating with each other. In the context of spatially distributed CPS, these connections can be dynamically dependent on the spatial configuration of the various components and agents. In these settings, robust monitoring of the distributed components is vital to ensuring complex behaviors are achieved, and safety properties are maintained. To this end, we look at defining the automaton semantics for the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a formal logic designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over mobile, spatially distributed CPS. Specifically, STREL reasons about spatio-temporal behavior over dynamic weighted graphs. While STREL is endowed with well defined qualitative and quantitative semantics, in this paper, we propose a novel construction of (weighted) alternating finite automata from STREL specifications that efficiently encodes these semantics. Moreover, we demonstrate how this automaton semantics can be used to perform both, offline and online monitoring for STREL specifications using a simulated drone swarm environment.</description>

      <title>Pseudovarieties of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most developed aspect of the theory of finite semigroups is their classification in pseudovarieties. The main motivation for investigating such entities comes from their connection with the classification of regular languages via Eilenberg's correspondence. This connection prompted the study of various natural operators on pseudovarieties and led to several important questions, both algebraic and algorithmic. The most important of these questions is decidability: given a finite semigroup is there an algorithm that tests whether it belongs to the pseudovariety? Since the most relevant operators on pseudovarieties do not preserve decidability, one often seeks to establish stronger properties. A key role is played by relatively free profinite semigroups, which is the counterpart of free algebras in universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief survey of the state of the art, highlighting some of the main developments and problems.</description>

      <title>Simplifying LTL Model Checking Given Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the verification of an LTL specification  $\varphi$ on a system $S$ given some prior knowledge $K$, an LTL  formula that $S$ is known to satisfy.  The automata-theoretic  approach to LTL model checking is implemented as an emptiness check  of the product $S\otimes A_{\lnot\varphi}$ where $A_{\lnot\varphi}$  is an automaton for the negation of the property.  We propose new  operations that simplify an automaton $A_{\lnot\varphi}$  \emph{given} some knowledge automaton $A_K$, to produce an automaton  $B$ that can be used instead of $A_{\lnot\varphi}$ for more  efficient model checking.  Our evaluation of these operations on a large benchmark derived from  the MCC'22 competition shows that even with simple knowledge, half  of the problems can be definitely answered without running an LTL  model checker, and the remaining problems can be simplified  significantly.</description>

      <title>Discounted-Sum Automata with Multiple Discount Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08780v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discounting the influence of future events is a key paradigm in economics and it is widely used in computer-science models, such as games, Markov decision processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, and automata. While a single game or MDP may allow for several different discount factors, nondeterministic discounted-sum automata (NDAs) were only studied with respect to a single discount factor. It is known that every class of NDAs with an integer as the discount factor has good computational properties: It is closed under determinization and under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, and there are algorithms for its basic decision problems, such as automata equivalence and containment. Extending the integer discount factor to an arbitrary rational number, loses most of these good properties.
  We define and analyze nondeterministic discounted-sum automata in which each transition can have a different integral discount factor (integral NMDAs). We show that integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors are not closed under determinization and under algebraic operations and that their containment problem is undecidable. We then define and analyze a restricted class of integral NMDAs, which we call tidy NMDAs, in which the choice of discount factors depends on the prefix of the word read so far. Among their special cases are NMDAs that correlate discount factors to actions (alphabet letters) or to the elapsed time. We show that for every function $\theta$ that defines the choice of discount factors, the class of $\theta$-NMDAs enjoys all of the above good properties of NDAs with a single integral discount factor, as well as the same complexity of the required decision problems. Tidy NMDAs are also as expressive as deterministic integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors.</description>

      <title>DeltaProduct: Improving State-Tracking in Linear RNNs via Householder Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKV-7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</description>
