      <title>Quantum phase transition in small-size 1d and 2d Josephson junction arrays: analysis of the experiments within the interacting plasmons picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically, Josephson junction (JJ) arrays can exhibit either a superconducting or insulating state, separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale $L_0$ from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, $L_{\varphi}(T)$ as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, $L_{\varphi}=v_p\hbar/k_B T$, and $L_0 \approx \Lambda$, where $v_p$ is the speed of the plasmons and $\Lambda$ is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Spin Fluctuation Spectral Functions $\alpha^{2}F$ in High-Temperature Superconducting Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations have been proposed as a key mechanism for mediating superconductivity, particularly in high-temperature superconducting cuprates, where conventional electron-phonon interactions alone cannot account for the observed critical temperatures. Traditionally, their role has been analyzed through tight-binding based model Hamiltonians. In this work we present a method that combines density functional theory with a momentum- and frequency-dependent pairing interaction derived from the Fluctuation Exchange (FLEX) type Random Phase Approximation (FLEX-RPA) to compute Eliashberg spectral functions $\alpha ^{2}F(\omega )$ which are central to spin fluctuation theory of superconductivity. We apply our numerical procedure to study a series of cuprates where our extracted material specific $\alpha ^{2}F(\omega )$ are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40-60 meV and their rapid decay at higher frequencies. Our exact diagonalization of a linearized BCS gap equation extracts superconducting energy gap functions for realistic Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and predicts their symmetry to be $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ in all studied systems. Via a variation of on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ for the copper $d$-electrons we show that that the range of the experimental values of $T_{c}$ can be reproduced in this approach but is extremely sensitive to the proximity of the spin density wave instability. These data highlight challenges in building first-principle theories of high temperature superconductivity but offer new insights beyond previous treatments, such as the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS-like $T_{c}$ equations, together with the evaluations of the material specific coupling constant $\lambda $ without reliance on tight-binding approximations of their electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Persistence of vortexlike phase fluctuations in underdoped to heavily overdoped Bi-2201 cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism that controls the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ as a function of doping is one of the central questions in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. While it is generally accepted that $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ in underdoped cuprates is not determined by the scale of pairing but by the onset of global phase coherence, the role of phase fluctuations in the overdoped region has been controversial. Here, our transport measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields ($H$) on underdoped Bi-2201 reveal immeasurably small Hall response for $T&gt;T_{\mathrm{c}}(H)$ as a signature of SC phase with vortexlike phase fluctuations. We find that the extent of such a regime in $T$ and $H$ is suppressed near optimal doping but becomes strongly enhanced in heavily overdoped Bi-2201. Our results thus show that vortexlike phase fluctuations play an important role in the field-tuned SC transition in the heavily overdoped region, in contrast to conventional mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. The unexpected nonmonotonic dependence of phase fluctuations on doping provides a new perspective on the SC transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effect in a superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the thermoelectric effect in a superconducting state having the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces which stays in a thin superconducting layer between a conventional superconductor and an insulator. The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Cocktail effect on superconductivity in hexagonal high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the study of the cocktail effect on superconductivity in high-entropy alloys (HEAs),using hexagonal close-packed HEAs as a prototype system. Compared with the compositional averages of the constituent elements, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is enhanced by from a factor of about 2 to over one order of magnitude. This Tc enhancement correlates with the reduction in the Debye temperature, underlining the importance of phonon softening in triggering the cocktail effect. Furthermore, we show that the Tc in these HEAs is governed by the average phonon frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength, the latter of which scales linearly with the inverse HEA molecular weight and is progressively weakened with increasing mixing entropy. Our study paves the way toward quantitative understanding of the superconductivity in HEAs.</description>

      <title>Edge supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the $\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation, and the $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field ($\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic manifestation of exception points in a non-Hermitian continuous model with an imaginary periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are distinct characteristics of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. In this study, we focus on EPs in continuous systems rather than discrete non-Hermitian systems, which are commonly investigated in both the experimental and theoretical studies. The non-Hermiticity of the system stems from the local imaginary potential, which can be effectively achieved through particle loss in recent quantum simulation setups. Leveraging the discrete Fourier transform, the dynamics of EPs within the low-energy sector can be well modeled by a Stark ladder system under the influence of a non-Hermitian tilted potential. To illustrate this, we systematically investigate continuous systems with finite imaginary potential wells and demonstrate the distinctive EP dynamics across different orders. Our investigation sheds light on EP behaviors, potentially catalyzing further exploration of EP phenomena across a variety of quantum simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana modes can be engineered in arrays where quantum dots (QDs) are coupled via grounded superconductors, effectively realizing an artificial Kitaev chain. Minimal Kitaev chains, composed by two QDs, can host fully-localized Majorana modes at discrete points in parameter space, known as Majorana sweet spots. Here, we extend previous works by theoretically investigating a setup with two QDs coupled via a floating superconducting island. We study the effects of the charging energy of the island and the properties of the resulting minimal Kitaev chain. We initially employ a minimal perturbative model, valid in the weak QD-island coupling regime, to derive analytic expressions for the Majorana sweet spots and the splitting of the ground state degeneracy as a function of tunable physical parameters. The conclusions from this perturbative approximation are then benchmarked using a microscopic model that explicitly describes the internal degrees of freedom of the island. Our work shows the existence of Majorana sweet spots, even when the island is not tuned at a charge-degeneracy point. In contrast to the Kitaev chains in grounded superconductors, these sweet spots involve a degeneracy between states with a well-defined number of particles.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional Rashba-Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling $\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhance symmetry in the IR that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized superconductivity from Majorana glue in the Kitaev-Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</description>

      <title>Stability-superconductivity map for compressed Na-intercalated graphite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent ab initio investigation of Na-C binary compounds under moderate pressures has uncovered a possible stable NaC$_4$ superconductor with an estimated critical temperature up to 41K. We revisit this promising binary system by performing a more focused exploration of Na-intercalated graphite configurations, assessing the sensitivity of their thermodynamic stability to density functional approximations at different (T,P) conditions, and examining their superconducting properties with the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The combinatorial screening of possible Na arrangements reveals additional stable stoichiometries, i.e., Na$_3$C$_{10}$, NaC$_8$, NaC$_{10}$, and NaC$_{12}$, that redefine the previously proposed convex hulls for pressures up to 10 GPa. The evaluation of formation enthalpies with different van der Waals functionals indicates that the proposed compounds might not be thermodynamically stable at zero temperature but some of them could stabilize due to the vibrational entropy or form via cold compression if graphite is used as a starting material. Our more rigorous modeling of the electron-phonon coupling in NaC$_4$ confirms the material's potential for high-temperature superconductivity, with a critical temperature reaching 48 K at 10 GPa, and reveals a well-defined two-gap structure unusual for an electron-doped compound. By tracking the position of the intercalant nearly free electron states with respect to the Fermi level in viable Na-C compounds, we map out the range of pressures and compositions needed for strong electron-phonon coupling and identify Na$_3$C$_{10}$ as an equally promising superconductor.</description>

      <title>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from C6-symmetric Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hidden singularities in correlated electron systems, which are caused by pair fluctuations of electron-electron or electron-hole bubbles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics, are clarified theoretically. The correlation function of each pair fluctuation is shown to have a bound in the zero Matsubara frequency branch, similarly to the chemical potential of ideal Bose gases. Once the bound is reached, the self-energy starts to acquire a component proportional to Green's function itself, i.e., the structure called one-particle reducible, to keep the correlation function within the bound. The singularities are closely related to, but distinct from, phase transitions with broken symmetries. Passing down through them is necessarily accompanied by a change in the single-particle density of states around the excitation threshold, such as the pseudogap behavior found here for the negative-$U$ Hubbard model above the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

Abstract: Approaches to developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art superconducting qubits employ aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations. Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized, purely sinusoidal current-phase relation. However, this relation is only expected to hold in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlO$_x$ barrier. Here we show that the standard current-phase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunneling through an inhomogeneous AlO$_x$ barrier predicts percent-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlO$_x$-based quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and the associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude, while preserving their anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and interactions in superconducting chains</title>

Abstract: Most studies of non-trivial topological systems are carried out in non-interacting models that admit an exact solution. This raises the question, to which extent the consideration of electronic correlations and disorder, present in real systems, modify these results. Exact solutions of correlated electronic systems with non-trivial topological properties, although fundamental are scarce. Among the non-interacting soluble models, we single out the Kitaev p-wave superconducting chain. It plays a crucial role in clarifying the appearance of emergent quasi-particles, the Majorana modes, associated with non-trivial topological properties. Given the relevance of this model, it would be extremely useful if it could be extended to include correlations and still remain solvable. In this work we investigate a superconducting Kitaev chain that interacts through a Falicov-Kimball Hamiltonian with a background of localized electrons. For some relevant values of the parameters, this model can be solved exactly by mapping into a non-interacting one. This allows for a detailed study of the interplay between electronic correlations and non-trivial topological behavior. Besides, the random occupation of the chain by the local moments brings new interesting effects associated with disorder.</description>
