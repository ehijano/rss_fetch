      <title>Dimension Reduction of Distributionally Robust Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with uncertainty sets consisting of high dimensional random vectors that are close in the multivariate Wasserstein distance to a reference random vector. We give conditions under which the images of these sets under scalar-valued aggregation functions are equal to or contained in uncertainty sets of univariate random variables defined via a univariate Wasserstein distance. This allows to rewrite or bound high-dimensional DRO problems with simpler DRO problems over the space of univariate random variables. We generalize the results to uncertainty sets defined via the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and the max-sliced Wasserstein and Bregman-Wasserstein divergence. The max-sliced divergences allow us to jointly model distributional uncertainty around the reference random vector and uncertainty in the aggregation function. Finally, we derive explicit bounds for worst-case risk measures that belong to the class of signed Choquet integrals.</description>

      <title>Technological schemes and control methods in the reconstruction of parallel gas pipeline systems under non-stationary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores technological schemes and control methods for reconstructing parallel gas pipeline systems under non-stationary conditions. It focuses on improving safety, reliability, and efficiency by automating valve control and integrating IoT-based monitoring. Automated shut-off valves are designed to detect sudden pressure drops and block leaks instantly. These valves utilize pressure drop rates and valve position sensors to detect and isolate leaks. Wireless pressure sensors and real-time monitoring systems enable remote control of gas flow. Mathematical modeling is employed to analyze pressure variations along damaged sections in order to determine optimal valve placement and activation timing. Machine learning algorithms in the control center are used to predict and verify leak locations based on sensor data. To ensure uninterrupted gas supply in the event of an accident, the study develops an empirical formula for determining the location of connecting pipes activated between parallel pipelines, based on real-time pressure data. The aim of this research is to reduce gas leaks and environmental hazards, ensure continuous gas supply during emergencies, enhance decision-making through automated systems, minimize gas losses, and reduce maintenance costs.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Weak Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method: a Unified Framework for Nesterov's Accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of accelerated proximal gradient methods where the sequence that controls the momentum term doesn't follow Nesterov's rule. We propose a relaxed weak accelerated proximal gradient (R-WAPG) method, a generic algorithm that unifies the convergence results for strongly convex and convex problems where the extrapolation constant is characterized by a sequence that is much weaker than Nesterov's rule. Our R-WAPG provides a unified framework for several notable Euclidean variants of FISTA and verifies their convergences. In addition, we provide the convergence rate of strongly convex objective with a constant momentum term. Without using the idea of restarting, we also reformulate R-WAPG as ``Free R-WAPG" so that it doesn't require any parameter. Explorative numerical experiments were conducted to show its competitive advantages.</description>

      <title>The Shortest Temporal Exploration Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal graph is a graph for which the edge set can change from one time step to the next. This paper considers undirected temporal graphs defined over L time steps and connected at each time step. We study the Shortest Temporal Exploration Problem (STEXP) that, given all the evolution of the graph, asks for a temporal walk that starts at a given vertex, moves over at most one edge at each time step, visits all the vertices, takes at most L time steps and traverses the smallest number of edges. . We prove that every constantly connected temporal graph with n vertices can be explored with O(n 1.5 ) edges traversed within O(n 3.5 ) time steps. This result improves the upper bound of O(n 2 ) edges for an exploration provided by the upper bound of time steps for an exploration which is also O(n 2 ). Morever, we study the case where the graph has a diameter bounded by a parameter k at each time step and we prove that there exists an exploration which takes O(kn 2 ) time steps and traverses O(kn) edges. Finally, the case where the underlying graph is a cycle is studied and tight bounds are provided on the number of edges traversed in the worst-case if L $\ge$ 2n -3.</description>

      <title>Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather and Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by variable renewable energy technologies. However, renewable electricity generation from wind and solar technologies, as well as electricity demand, varies with the weather. This work addresses the problem of determining optimal capacities for renewable technologies in energy systems that ensure sufficient electricity supply when dealing with multi-year time-series data. An iterative algorithm is proposed that starts by optimising an arbitrary starting time-series, followed by adding additional constraints and reoptimising the modified optimisation problem until sufficient energy supply is provided for all time--series, i.e. the solution is robust to weather and demand variations. This is evaluated in a computational study on a German energy system model.The results show that the iterative algorithm finds robust solutions for an increase of 2-2.5% in total annual cost for a simplified model in gurobipy and 2.9% for a model built in the model framework ETHOS.FINE. Testing the feasibility for non robust solutions showed that supply gaps occurred in at least some of the remaining years. Based on the results of this work, ensuring feasibility within an energy system model for multiple time-series boils down to two factors: ensuring sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of high demand combined with low electricity generation from wind and photovoltaic, and enforcing sufficient total annual electricity generation. Our proposed open source iterative algorithm is able to ensure this. For general modelling, it is recommended to check for systematic effects of different years' time--series on energy system models especially for wind, but also for photovoltaics, include dark lull and cold period effects on generation and demand in time--series, and assess the feasibility of energy system models using different time-series.</description>

      <title>Modeling and analysis methods for early detection of leakage points in gas transmission systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of leaks in gas transmission systems is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted gas supply, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental and economic risks. This study aims to develop an analytical method for accurately identifying leak locations in gas pipelines based on unsteady gas flow dynamics. A novel approach is proposed that utilizes pressure variations at the inlet and outlet points to determine the minimum fixation time (t = t1) required for real-time leak detection. Through mathematical modeling and numerical analysis, the study demonstrates that the ratio of pressure drops at different points along the pipeline can be effectively used to pinpoint leakage locations. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves detection accuracy and response time, making it a viable solution for integration into gas pipeline monitoring and control systems.</description>

      <title>Revisit Gradient Descent for Geodesically Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work of Zhang and Sra, gradient descent methods for geodesically convex optimization were comprehensively studied. In particular, based on a refined use of the triangle comparison theorem of Toponogov, Zhang and Sra derived a comparison inequality that relates the current iterate, the next iterate and the optimum point. Since their seminal work, numerous follow-ups have studied different downstream usages of their comparison lemma. However, all results along this line relies on strong assumptions, such as bounded domain assumption or curvature bounded below assumption.
  In this work, we introduce the concept of quasilinearization to optimization, presenting a novel framework for analyzing geodesically convex optimization. By leveraging this technique, we establish state-of-the-art convergence rates -- for both deterministic and stochastic settings -- under substantially weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <title>Engineering solutions for non-stationary gas pipeline reconstruction and emergency management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction, management, and optimization of gas pipelines is of significant importance for solving modern engineering problems. This paper presents innovative methodologies aimed at the effective reconstruction of gas pipelines under unstable conditions. The research encompasses the application of machine learning and optimization algorithms, targeting the enhancement of system reliability and the optimization of interventions during emergencies. The findings of the study present engineering solutions aimed at addressing the challenges in real-world applications by comparing the performance of various algorithms. Consequently, this work contributes to the advancement of cutting-edge approaches in the field of engineering and opens new perspectives for future research. A highly reliable and efficient technological Figure has been proposed for managing emergency processes in gas transportation based on the principles of the reconstruction phase. For complex gas pipeline systems, new approaches have been investigated for the modernization of existing control process monitoring systems. These approaches are based on modern achievements in control theory and information technology, aiming to select emergency and technological modes. One of the pressing issues is to develop a method to minimize the transmission time of measured and controlled data on non-stationary flow parameters of gas networks to dispatcher control centers. Therefore, the reporting Figures obtained for creating a reliable information base for dispatcher centers using modern methods to efficiently manage the gas dynamic processes of non-stationary modes are of particular importance.</description>

      <title>Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation through continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a parametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a dynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory of an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original system, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter evolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define sets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the system dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics and the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as long as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual "control input" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we demonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint of the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the original system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Tractable reformulations of DRO problems over structured optimal transport ambiguity sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structuring ambiguity sets in Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) can improve their statistical properties when the uncertainty consists of multiple independent components. The aim of this paper is to solve stochastic optimization problems with unknown uncertainty when we only have access to a finite set of samples from it. Exploiting strong duality of DRO problems over structured ambiguity sets, we derive tractable reformulations for certain classes of DRO and uncertainty quantification problems. We also derive tractable reformulations for distributionally robust chance-constrained problems. As the complexity of the reformulations may grow exponentially with the number of independent uncertainty components, we employ clustering strategies to obtain informative estimators, which yield problems of manageable complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results in a numerical simulation example.</description>

      <title>Optimal promotions of new products on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for analyzing the optimal promotion in the Bass model for the spreading of new products on networks. For general networks with $M$ nodes, the optimal promotion is the solution of $2^M-1$ nonlinearly-coupled boundary-value problems. On structured networks, however, the number of equations can be reduced to a manageable size which is amendable to simulations and analysis. This enables us to gain insight into the effect of the network structure on optimal promotions. We find that the optimal advertising strategy decreases with time, whereas the optimal boosting of peer effects increases from zero and then decreases. In low-degree networks, it is optimal to prioritize advertising over boosting peer effects, but this relation is flipped in high-degree networks. When the planning horizon is finite, the optimal promotion continues until the last minute, as opposed to an infinite planning horizon where the optimal promotion decays to zero. Finally, promotions with short planning horizons can yield an order of magnitude higher increase of profits, compared to those with long planning horizons.</description>

      <title>A geometric ensemble method for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approximations to Bayesian inference rely on either approximations by statistics such as mean and covariance or by point particles. Recent advances such as the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter have generalized these notions to sums of parameterized distributions. This work presents a new methodology for approximating Bayesian inference by sums of uniform distributions on convex polytopes. The methodology presented herein is developed from the simplest convex polytope filter that takes advantage of uniform prior and measurement uncertainty, to an operationally viable ensemble filter with Kalmanized approximations to updating convex polytopes. Numerical results on the Ikeda map show the viability of this methodology in the low-dimensional setting, and numerical results on the Lorenz '96 equations similarly show viability in the high-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Non-Steady-State Frequency-Domain Data in Willems' Fundamental Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma enables data-driven analysis and control by characterizing an unknown system's behavior directly in terms of measured data. In this work, we extend a recent frequency-domain variant of this result--previously limited to steady-state data--to incorporate non-steady-state data including transient phenomena. This approach eliminates the need to wait for transients to decay during data collection, significantly reducing the experiment duration. Unlike existing frequency-domain system identification methods, our approach integrates transient data without preprocessing, making it well-suited for direct data-driven analysis and control. We demonstrate its effectiveness by isolating transients in the collected data and performing FRF evaluation at arbitrary frequencies in a numerical case study including noise.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ZETA, a new MATLAB library for Zonotope-based EsTimation and fAult diagnosis of discrete-time systems. It features user-friendly implementations of set representations based on zonotopes, namely zonotopes, constrained zonotopes, and line zonotopes, in addition to a basic implementation of interval arithmetic. This library has capabilities starting from the basic set operations with these sets, including propagations through nonlinear functions using various approximation methods. The features of ZETA allow for reachability analysis and state estimation of discrete-time linear, nonlinear, and descriptor systems, in addition to active fault diagnosis of linear systems. Efficient order reduction methods are also implemented for the respective set representations. Some examples are presented in order to illustrate the functionalities of the new library.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hybrid XOR$-$CNF SAT Problems Natively with In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is a computationally challenging decision problem central to many industrial applications. For SAT problems in cryptanalysis, circuit design, and telecommunication, solutions can often be found more efficiently by representing them with a combination of exclusive OR (XOR) and conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses. We propose a hardware accelerator architecture that natively embeds and solves such hybrid CNF$-$XOR problems using in-memory computing hardware. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm and demonstrate, both experimentally and through simulations, how it can be efficiently implemented with memristor crossbar arrays. Compared to the conventional approaches that translate CNF$-$XOR problems to pure CNF problems, our simulations show that the accelerator improves computation speed, energy efficiency, and chip area utilization by $\sim$10$\times$ for a set of hard cryptographic benchmarking problems. Moreover, the accelerator achieves a $\sim$10$\times$ speedup and a $\sim$1000$\times$ gain in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art SAT solvers running on CPUs.</description>

      <title>FJ-MM: The Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model with Memory and Higher-Order Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model has been extensively explored and validated, spanning applications in social science, systems and control, game theory, and algorithmic research. In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of the FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop (higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally incorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence significantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion profile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and equilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be reduced to those of a comparison model--namely, the standard FJ model with a modified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established stability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence rate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags introduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower convergence.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Mirror-Prox for Nonsmooth and Low-Rank Matrix Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank and nonsmooth matrix optimization problems capture many fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \textit{smooth} low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced. In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a \textit{strict complementarity} condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, approximated variants of two popular \textit{mirror-prox} methods: the Euclidean \textit{extragradient method} and mirror-prox with \textit{matrix exponentiated gradient updates}, when initialized with a "warm-start", converge to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$, while requiring only two \textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration. Moreover, for the extragradient method we also consider relaxed versions of strict complementarity which yield a trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating both the plausibility of the strict complementarity assumption, and the efficient convergence of our proposed low-rank mirror-prox variants.</description>

Abstract: Regularization by the Shannon entropy enables us to efficiently and approximately solve optimal transport problems on a finite set. This paper is concerned with regularized optimal transport problems via Bregman divergence. We introduce the required properties for Bregman divergences, provide a non-asymptotic error estimate for the regularized problem, and show that the error estimate becomes faster than exponentially.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Problem Arising in Sailboat Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the optimal control problem for a sailboat aiming to reach an upwind buoy, assuming that the wind speed is constant and the wind direction follows a Brownian motion. The yacht navigates in $\R^2$ and the target is a ball of radius $\eta &gt;0$ centered at the origin. We derive the equations of motion and provide their closed-form solution. The yacht is subject to a tacking cost $c\geq 0$. We define two control problems, one where $c=0$ and another where $c&gt;0$. For both cases, we establish an analytical upper bound on the value function by constructing a strategy that enables the yacht to reach the buoy within a finite expected number of tacks. For the case with $c = 0$, where no tacking cost applies, we conjecture an optimal strategy which may involve an infinite number of tacks. The controlled state equation has non-continuous coefficients so standard results on existence and uniqueness of a strong solution do not apply. We provide a proof using the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

Abstract: Transforming an asymmetric system into a symmetric system makes it possible to exploit the simplifying properties of symmetry in control problems. We define and characterize the family of symmetrizable systems, which can be transformed into symmetric systems by a linear transformation of their inputs and outputs. In the special case of complete symmetry, the set of symmetrizable systems is convex and verifiable by a semidefinite program. We show that a Khatri-Rao rank needs to be satisfied for a system to be symmetrizable and conclude that linear systems are generically neither symmetric nor symmetrizable.</description>

      <title>Uncertain standard quadratic optimization under distributional assumptions: a chance-constrained epigraphic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard quadratic optimization problem (StQP) consists of minimizing a quadratic form over the standard simplex. Without convexity or concavity of the quadratic form, the StQP is NP-hard. This problem has many relevant real-life applications ranging portfolio optimization to pairwise clustering and replicator dynamics. Sometimes, the data matrix is uncertain. We investigate models where the distribution of the data matrix is known but where both the StQP after realization of the data matrix and the here-and-now problem are indefinite. We test the performance of a chance-constrained epigraphic StQP to the uncertain StQP.</description>

      <title>Methods with Local Steps and Random Reshuffling for Generally Smooth Non-Convex Federated Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption, though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the Polyak-{\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Flow Decomposition Methods for RNA Multi-Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate distributed temporal difference (TD) learning for a networked multi-agent Markov decision process. The proposed approach is based on distributed optimization algorithms, which can be interpreted as primal-dual Ordinary differential equation (ODE) dynamics subject to null-space constraints. Based on the exponential convergence behavior of the primal-dual ODE dynamics subject to null-space constraints, we examine the behavior of the final iterate in various distributed TD-learning scenarios, considering both constant and diminishing step-sizes and incorporating both i.i.d. and Markovian observation models. Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm does not require the assumption that the underlying communication network structure is characterized by a doubly stochastic matrix.</description>

      <title>Untangling Lariats: Subgradient Following of Variationally Penalized Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an apparatus for subgradient-following of the optimum of convex problems with variational penalties. In this setting, we receive a sequence $y_i,\ldots,y_n$ and seek a smooth sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. The smooth sequence needs to attain the minimum Bregman divergence to an input sequence with additive variational penalties in the general form of $\sum_i{}g_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)$. We derive known algorithms such as the fused lasso and isotonic regression as special cases of our approach. Our approach also facilitates new variational penalties such as non-smooth barrier functions.
  We then derive a novel lattice-based procedure for subgradient following of variational penalties characterized through the output of arbitrary convolutional filters. This paradigm yields efficient solvers for high-order filtering problems of temporal sequences in which sparse discrete derivatives such as acceleration and jerk are desirable. We also introduce and analyze new multivariate problems in which $\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ with variational penalties that depend on $\|\mathbf{x}_{i+1}-\mathbf{x}_i\|$. The norms we consider are $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ which promote group sparsity.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>Phantom Edges in the Problem Hamiltonian: A Method for Increasing Performance and Graph Visibility for QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. However, a major limitation of QAOA is that it is a "local" algorithm for finite circuit depths, meaning it can only optimize over local properties of the graph. In this paper, we present Phantom-QAOA, a new QAOA ansatz that introduces only one additional parameter to the standard ansatz -- regardless of system size -- allowing QAOA to "see" more of the graph at a given depth $p$. We achieve this by modifying the target graph to include additional $\alpha$-weighted edges, with $\alpha$ serving as a tunable parameter. This modified graph is then used to construct the phase operator and allows QAOA to explore a wider range of the graph's features. We derive a general formula for our new ansatz at $p=1$ and analytically show an improvement in the approximation ratio for cycle graphs. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate significant improvements in the approximation ratio for the Max-Cut problem over the standard QAOA ansatz for $p=1$ and $p=2$ on random regular graphs up to 16 nodes.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the problem of providing closed-loop stability guarantees with a scalable data-driven design. We combine virtual reference feedback tuning with dissipativity constraints on the controller for closed-loop stability. The constraints are formulated as a set of linear inequalities in the frequency domain. This leads to a convex problem that is scalable with respect to the length of the data and the complexity of the controller. An extension of virtual reference feedback tuning to include disturbance dynamics is also discussed. The proposed data-driven control design is illustrated by a soft gripper impedance control example.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Non-Normalized Solutions of Generalized Nash Equilibrium in Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamic games with shared constraints, Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE) are often computed using the normalized solution concept, which assumes identical Lagrange multipliers for shared constraints across all players. While widely used, this approach excludes other potentially valuable GNE. This paper addresses the limitations of normalized solutions in racing scenarios through three key contributions. First, we highlight the shortcomings of normalized solutions with a simple racing example. Second, we propose a novel method based on the Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) formulation to compute non-normalized Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE). Third, we demonstrate that our proposed method overcomes the limitations of normalized GNE solutions and enables richer multi-modal interactions in realistic racing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based particle method for sampling from a target distribution, e.g., in generative modeling and Bayesian inference. SVGD does not require estimating the gradient of the log-density, which is called score estimation. In practice, SVGD can be slow compared to score-estimation based sampling algorithms. To design fast and efficient high-dimensional sampling algorithms, we introduce ASVGD, an accelerated SVGD, based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' momentum update, we also study a Wasserstein metric regularization. For the generalized bilinear kernel and the Gaussian kernel, toy numerical examples with varied target distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other popular sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.</description>
