      <title>On the structure vector field in lightlike hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lightlike hypersurfaces of an indefinite almost contact metric-manifold $\bar{M}$. We prove that there are only two types of such hypersurfaces, known as ascreen and inascreen, with respect to the position of the structure vector field of $\bar{M}$. We also show that the second class of hypersurfaces naturally admits an almost Hermitian structure.</description>

      <title>On polynomial solutions to the minimal surface equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in finding nonlinear polynomials $P$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that solves the minimal surface equation.
  We first prove a structure theorem on such polynomials. We show that the highest degree term $P_m$ must factor as $P_0^kQ_m$ where $k$ is odd, $Q_m\ge 0$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $P_0$ is irreducible, and that the level sets of $P_m$ are all area minimizing. Moreover, the unique tangent cone of $\operatorname{graph} P$ at $\infty$ is $\{P_0=0\}\times\mathbb{R}$. If $k\ge 3$, we know further that lower order terms down to some degree are divisible by $P_0$.
  We also show that $P$ must contain terms of both high and low degree. In particular, it cannot be homogeneous. As a corollary, we prove that there is no quadratic or cubic polynomial solution.
  Using a general decay lower bound of Green's functions on minimal hypersurfaces we are able to show that $\operatorname{deg} P_0+k^{-1}\operatorname{deg} Q_m\le n-2$.
  Finally, we prove that a polynomial minimal graph cannot have $C\times \mathbb{R}^l$ as its tangent cone at $\infty$ where $l\ge 1$ and $C$ is any isoparametric cone. We also show that the existence of a nonlinear polynomial solutions on $\mathbb{R}^8$ will imply the existence of an area minimizing but not strictly minimizing cubic cone in $\mathbb{R}^8$. These results indicate that finding an explicit polynomial solution can be hard.</description>

      <title>Green's functions on minimal submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for the Green's function on an area-minimizing boundary, it is bounded below universally by the Euclidean Green's function. We also obtain asymptotics of the Green's function near the pole and infinity. These are done by proving a $C^\alpha$ convergence of the Green's functions under the convergence of area-minimizing boundaries. For converging multiplicity 1 stationary varifolds, we have $L^p$ convergence of the Green's functions, but there are examples of stationary varifolds on which the lower bounds and asymptotics may fail. An application of the lower bound will be given in [9].</description>

      <title>Global Implicit Function Theorems and Critical Point Theory in Fr\'{e}chet Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two versions of a global implicit function theorem, which involve no loss of derivative, for Keller's $ C_c^1 $-mappings between arbitrary Fr\'{e}chet spaces. Subsequently, within this framework, we apply these theorems to establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial value problems that involve the loss of one derivative. Moreover, we prove a Lagrange multiplier theorem by employing indirect applications of the global implicit function theorems through submersions and transversality.</description>

      <title>Weak limits of the $J$-flow and the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow on K\"ahler surfaces: boundary cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a pair of K\"ahler classes is $J$-nef, the $J$-flow on a compact K\"ahler surface converges to a weak solution of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in the sense of currents. We also establish the same convergence behavior for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow. The method is based on a property of a limit of viscosity subsolutions.</description>

      <title>Tiling spaces are covering spaces over irrational tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tiling spaces in the diffeological context. We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of one-dimensional tiling spaces over the irrational torus. We use the diffeological classification of irrationatl tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of tiling spaces.</description>

      <title>Examples of Ricci limit spaces with infinite holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 3$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, and $(X,h)$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold with ${\rm Ric}_h &gt; \lambda $.
  In this paper, we construct, for each given $\epsilon &gt;0$, a sequence of $(n+2)$-dimensional manifolds $(M_{i} ,g_i ) \stackrel{GH}{\longrightarrow} (X_\epsilon ,d_\epsilon ) $ with ${\rm Ric}_{g_i} &gt; \lambda $, such that $d_{GH} (X,X_\epsilon ) \leq \epsilon $, and $X_\epsilon $ is homeomorphic to the space obtained by removing an infinite number of balls from $X$. Hence $X_\epsilon $ has dense boundary with an infinite number of connected components. Moreover, $X_\epsilon $ has no open subset which is topologically a manifold. This generalizes Hupp-Naber-Wang's result (arxiv: 2308.03909) from $4$-dimensional case to the general case of dimension $n\geq 3$. Notably, the restriction $n\geq 3$ is essential, as Ricci limit spaces in $1$ and $2$ dimensions always have a dense open subset which is topologically a manifold.
  Our construction differs from that of Hupp-Naber-Wang. In their approach, Hupp-Naber-Wang considered doing an infinite number of blow-ups on the local complex surface structure of $X$, thus relying on the $4$-dimensional condition. However, our method involves removing an infinite number of balls from $X$, allowing us to construct in the general case of dimensions greater than or equal to $3$.
  As a corollary, we provide a solution to an open problem posed by Naber in the $3$-dimensional case. Note that the $3$-dimensional case is the only remaining unresolved case in Naber's problem. Consequently, Naber's question is resolved in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized positive scalar curvature on spin$^c$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,L)$ be a non-spin spin$^c$ manifold. Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $A$ on $L$, and let $D_L$ be the associated spin$^c$ Dirac operator. Let $R^{tw}_{g,A}:=R_g + 2ic(\Omega)$ be the twisted scalar curvature (which takes values in the endomorphims of the spinor bundle), where $R_g$ is the scalar curvature of $g$ and $2ic(\Omega)$ comes from the curvature $2$-form $\Omega$ of the connection $A$. Then the Lichnerowicz-Schr\"odinger formula for the square of the Dirac operator takes the form $D_L^2 =\nabla^*\nabla+\frac{1}{4}R^{tw}_{g,A}$. In a previous work we proved that a closed non-spin simply-connected spin$^c$-manifold $(M,L)$ of dimension $n\geq 5$ admits a pair $(g,A)$ such that $R^{tw}_{g,A}&gt;0$ if and only if the index $\alpha^c(M,L):=\text{ind}\, D_L$ vanishes in $K_n$. In this paper we introduce a scalar-valued generalized scalar curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}:=R_g - 2|\Omega|_{op}$, where $|\Omega|_{op}$ is the pointwise operator norm of Clifford multiplication $c(\Omega)$, acting on spinors. We show that the positivity condition on the operator $R^{tw}_{g,A}$ is equivalent to the positivity of the scalar function $R^{gen}_{g,A}$. We prove a corresponding trichotomy theorem concerning the curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}$, and study its implications. We also show that the space $\mathcal{R}^{gen+}(M,L)$ of pairs $(g,A)$ with $R^{gen}_{g,A}&gt;0$ has non-trivial topology, and address a conjecture about non-triviality of the ``index difference'' map.</description>

      <title>Nonpositively curved surfaces are Loewner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every closed nonpositively curved surface satisfies Loewner's systolic inequality. The proof relies on a combination of the Gauss-Bonnet formula with an averaging argument using the invariance of the Liouville measure under the geodesic flow. This enables us to find a disk with large total curvature around its center yielding a large area.</description>

      <title>The Brioschi Formula for the Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brioschi formula expresses the Gaussian curvature $K$ in terms of the functions $E, F$ and $G$ in local coordinates of a surface $S$. This implies the Gauss' theorema egregium, which says that the Gaussian curvature just depends on angles, distances, and their rates of change.
  In most of the textbooks, the Gauss' theorema egregium was proved as a corollary to the derivation of the Gauss equations, a set of equations expressing $EK, FK$ and $GK$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols can be expressed in terms of $E$, $F$ and $G$. In principle, one can derive the Brioschi formula from the Gauss equations after some tedious calculations.
  In this note, we give a direct elementary proof of the Brioschi formula without using Christoffel symbols. The key to the proof are properties of matrices and determinants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and study the negative gradient flow of an energy functional of Spin(7)-structures on compact 8-manifolds. The energy functional is the $L^2$-norm of the torsion of the Spin(7)-structure. Our main result is the short-time existence and uniqueness of solutions to the flow. We also explain how this negative gradient flow is the most general flow of Spin(7)-structures. We also study solitons of the flow and prove a non-existence result for compact expanding solitons.</description>

      <title>Geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors and associated Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the geometric mean of two positive definite matrices to that of third-order tensors using the notion of T-product. Specifically, we define the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors and verify several properties that "mean" should satisfy including the idempotence and the commutative property, and so on. Moreover, it is shown that the geometric mean is a unique T-positive definite solution of an algebraic Riccati tensor equation and can be expressed as solutions of algebraic Riccati matrix equations. In addition, we investigate the Riemannian manifold associated with the geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors, considering it as a totally geodesic embedded submanifold of the Riemannian manifold associated with the case of matrices. It is particularly shown that the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors is the midpoint of a unique geodesic joining the tensors, and the manifold is a Cartan-Hadamard-Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity and the growth rates of solutions to two-dimensional Monge-Amp\`ere equations with the right-hand side exhibiting polynomial growth. Utilizing this analysis, we demonstrate that the translators for the flow by sub-affine-critical powers of the Gauss curvature are smooth, strictly convex entire graphs. These graphs exhibit specific growth rates that depend solely on the power of the flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a transcendental generalization of Nakamaye's theorem to compact complex manifolds when the form is not assumed to be closed. We apply the recent analytic technique developed by Collins--Tosatti to show that the non-Hermitian locus of a nef and big $(1,1)$-form, which is not necessarily closed, on a compact complex manifold equals the union of all positive-dimensional analytic subvarieties where the restriction of the form is not big (null locus). As an application, we can give an alternative proof of the Nakai--Moishezon criterion of Buchdahl and Lamari for complex surfaces and generalize this result in higher dimensions. This is also used for studying degenerate complex Monge--Amp\`ere equations on compact Hermitian manifolds. Finally, we investigate finite time non-collapsing singularities of the Chern--Ricci flow, partially answering a question raised by Tosatti and Weinkove.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give examples on the use of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in inverse problems. We show uniqueness in the linearized Calder\'on problem on holomorphically separable K\"ahler manifolds, and in the Calder\'on problem for nonlinear equations on conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds. We also study the holomorphic separability condition in terms of plurisubharmonic functions. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem allows us to generalize and simplify earlier results. It also makes it possible to circumvent the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and inversion of explicit transforms in certain cases.</description>

Abstract: We consider practical aspects of reconstructing planar curves with prescribed Euclidean or affine curvatures. These curvatures are invariant under the special Euclidean group and the equi-affine groups, respectively, and play an important role in computer vision and shape analysis. We discuss and implement algorithms for such reconstruction, and give estimates on how close reconstructed curves are relative to the closeness of their curvatures in appropriate metrics. Several illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Counting geodesics on compact symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the inverse image of the Riemannian exponential map at a basepoint of a compact symmetric space as the disjoint union of so called focal orbits through a maximal torus. These are orbits of a subgroup of the isotropy group acting in the tangent space at the basepoint. We show how their dimensions (infinitesimal data) and connected components (topological data) are encoded in the diagram, multiplicities, Weyl group and lattice of the symmetric space. Obtaining this data is precisely what we mean by counting geodesics. This extends previous results on compact Lie groups. We apply our results to give short independent proofs of known results on compact symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>General rigidity principles for stable and minimal elastic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a wide class of curvature energy functionals defined for planar curves under the fixed-length constraint, we obtain optimal necessary conditions for global and local minimizers. Our results extend Maddocks' and Sachkov's rigidity principles for Euler's elastica by a new, unified and geometric approach. This in particular leads to complete classification of stable closed $p$-elasticae for all $p\in(1,\infty)$ and of stable pinned $p$-elasticae for $p\in(1,2]$. Our proof is based on a simple but robust `cut-and-paste' trick without computing the energy nor its second variation, which works well for planar periodic curves but also extends to some non-periodic or non-planar cases. An analytically remarkable point is that our method is directly valid for the highly singular regime $p\in(1,\frac{3}{2}]$ in which the second variation may not exist even for smooth variations.</description>

      <title>Compatible $E$-Differential Forms on Lie Algebroids over (Pre-)Multisymplectic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider higher generalizations of both a (twisted) Poisson structure and the equivariant condition of a momentum map on a symplectic manifold. On a Lie algebroid over a (pre-)symplectic and (pre-)multisymplectic manifold, we introduce a Lie algebroid differential form called a compatible $E$-$n$-form. This differential form satisfies a compatibility condition, which is consistent with both the Lie algebroid structure and the (pre-)(multi)symplectic structure. There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted Poisson structure and a twisted $R$-Poisson structure for a pre-$n$-plectic manifold. Moreover, momentum maps and momentum sections on symplectic manifolds, homotopy momentum maps and homotopy momentum sections on multisymplectic manifolds have this structure.</description>

      <title>The Heterotic-Ricci flow and its three-dimensional solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel curvature flow, the Heterotic-Ricci flow, as the two-loop renormalization group flow of the Heterotic string common sector and study its three-dimensional compact solitons. The Heterotic-Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non-negative real parameter $\kappa$, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three-form $H$ on a manifold $M$. Its most salient feature is that it involves several terms quadratic in the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. When $\kappa = 0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as a modification of the latter via the second-order correction prescribed by Heterotic string theory, whereas when $H=0$ and $\kappa &gt;0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG-2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three-form $H$. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of three-dimensional solitons for the Heterotic-Ricci flow and constitute our main object of study. We prove a number of structural results for three-dimensional Heterotic solitons, obtaining the complete classification of compact three-dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as hyperbolic three-manifolds or quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left-invariant metric. Furthermore, we prove that all Einstein three-dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton. In this direction, we prove that Einstein Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore cannot be deformed into a solution with non-constant dilaton. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigidity result for compact supergravity solutions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Positive scalar curvature metrics and aspherical summands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ that the connected sum of a closed aspherical $n$-manifold with an arbitrary non-compact manifold does not admit a complete metric with nonnegative scalar curvature. In particular, a special case of our result answers a question of Gromov.
  More generally, we generalize the partial classification result of Chodosh, Li, and Liokumovich to the non-compact domination case with our newly-developed technique.
  Our result unifies all previous results of this type, and confirms the validity of Gromov's non-compact domination conjecture for closed aspherical manifolds of dimensions 3, 4, and 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the procedure of regularization in the context of the Lipschitz version of de Rham calculus on metric simplicial complexes with bounded geometry. It provides us with the machinery to handle the de Rham homomorphism for $L_\pi$-cohomologies. In this respect, we obtain the condition resolving the question of triviality of the kernel for de Rham homomorphism. In particular, we specify the non-trivial cohomology classes explicitly for a sequence of parameters $\pi = \langle p_0,\,p_1,\dots,\,p_n\rangle$ missing non-increasing monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove gap results for complete self-shrinkers of the $r$-mean curvature flow involving a modified second fundamental form. These results extend previous results for self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow due to Cao-Li and Cheng-Peng. To prove our results we show that, under suitable curvature bounds, proper self-shrinkers are parabolic for a certain second-order differential operator which generalizes the drifted Laplacian and, even if is not proper, this differential operator satisfies an Omori-Yau type maximum principle.</description>

Abstract: Euler's elastica is defined by a critical point of the total squared curvature under the fixed length constraint, and its $L^p$-counterpart is called $p$-elastica. In this paper we completely classify all $p$-elasticae in the plane and obtain their explicit formulae as well as optimal regularity. To this end we introduce new types of $p$-elliptic functions which streamline the whole argument and result. As an application we also classify all closed planar $p$-elasticae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Hamiltonian dynamics on singular symplectic manifolds and prove the Arnold conjecture for a large class of $b^m$-symplectic manifolds. Novel techniques are introduced to associate smooth symplectic forms to the original singular symplectic structure, under some mild conditions. These techniques yield the validity of the Arnold conjecture for singular symplectic manifolds across multiple scenarios. More precisely, we prove a lower bound on the number 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbits for $b^{2m}$-symplectic manifolds depending only on the topology of the manifold. Moreover, for $b^m$-symplectic surfaces, we improve the lower bound depending on the topology of the pair $(M,Z)$. We then venture into the study of Floer homology to this singular realm and we conclude with a list of open questions.</description>

      <title>Exotic Dehn twists on 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of exotic Dehn twists along 3-manifolds $\neq S^3$ inside $4$-manifolds, which produces the first known examples of exotic diffeomorphisms of contractible 4-manifolds, more generally of definite 4-manifolds, and exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with $\neq S^3$ boundary that survive after one stabilization. We also construct the smallest closed 4-manifold known to support an exotic diffeomorphism. These exotic diffeomorphisms are the Dehn twists along certain Seifert fibered 3-manifolds. As a consequence, we get loops of diffeomorphisms of 3-manifolds that topologically extend to some 4-manifolds $X$ but not smoothly so, implying the non-surjectivity of $\pi_1(\mathrm{Diff}(X)) \to \pi_1(\mathrm{Homeo}(X))$. Our method uses $2$-parameter families Seiberg-Witten theory over $\mathbb{RP}^2$, while known methods to detect exotic diffeomorphisms used $1$-parameter families gauge-theoretic invariants. Using a similar strategy, we construct a new kind of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, given as commutators of diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on real algebraic maps which are topologically special generic maps and generalize the canonical projections of the unit spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10646v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morse functions with exactly two singular points on homotopy spheres and canonical projections of spheres are generalized as special generic maps. A special generic map is, roughly, a smooth map represented as the composition of a smooth surjection onto a manifold whose preimages are diffeomorphic to a unit sphere in the interior of the manifold and single point sets on the boundary with a smooth immersion of codimension $0$.
  This paper constructs real algebraic maps topologically special generic maps whose images are smoothly embedded manifolds.
  We are also interested in construction of explicit and meaningful smooth maps in differential topology and recently ones in real algebraic geometry. This has been an important and difficult problem.
  In such stories, we have previously constructed real algebraic maps topologically regarded as special generic maps. This paper is a kind of additional short remark on such maps.</description>

      <title>Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

Abstract: The present work investigates the evolution of linear perturbations of time-dependent ideal fluid flows with advected quantities, expressed in terms of the second order variations of the action corresponding to a Lagrangian defined on a semidirect product space. This approach is related to Jacobi fields along geodesics and several examples are given explicitly to elucidate our approach. Numerical simulations of the perturbation dynamics are also presented.</description>
