      <title>Modelling competition for space: Emergent inefficiency and inequality due to spatial self-organization among a group of crowd-avoiding agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition for a limited resource is the hallmark of many complex systems, and often, that resource turns out to be the physical space itself. In this work, we study a novel model designed to elucidate the dynamics and emergence in complex adaptive systems in which agents compete for some spatially spread resource. Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that the efficiency with which the agents utilize the physical space shows transitions at two values of densities. The first of these transitions demarcates efficient and inefficient phases of the system, and the second one signifies the density at which the inefficiency is maximum. We show that the variation of inefficiency with respect to the information accessible to the agents shows opposing behavior above and below this second transition density. We also look into the inequality of resource sharing in the model and show that although inefficiency can be a non-monotonic function of information depending upon the parameters of the model, inequality, in general, decreases with information. Our study sheds light on the role of competition, spatial constraints, and agent traits within complex adaptive systems, offering insights into their emergent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Socio-cognitive Networks between Researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding why researchers cite each other has been a longstanding conjecture in studying scientific networks. Prior research suggests relevance, group cohesion, or honest source crediting as possible factors. However, the dual nature of cognitive and social dimensions underlying citation is often overlooked by not considering the intermediary steps leading up to a citation. For one work to be cited by another, it must first be published by a set of authors. Therefore, we investigate the reasons behind researchers' citations, explicitly examining the interplay of socio-cognitive ties through the interdependence of coauthorship and citation networks. We assess our claims in an empirical analysis by employing the Author-Oriented Relational HyperEvent Model (AuthRHEM) to study Chilean astronomers' citation and collaboration behavior between 2013 and 2015 in a joint framework. We find evidence that when deciding which work to cite, authors prefer other work with novelty and cognitive ties, such as work-to-work relations. At the same time, coherent groups are relevant because coauthors are cocited more frequently in subsequent publications.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport with constraints: from mirror descent to classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding optimal trajectories for multiple traffic demands in a congested network is a challenging task. Optimal transport theory is a principled approach that has been used successfully to study various transportation problems. Its usage is limited by the lack of principled and flexible ways to incorporate realistic constraints. We propose a principled physics-based approach to impose constraints flexibly in such optimal transport problems. Constraints are included in mirror descent dynamics using the principle of D'Alembert-Lagrange from classical mechanics. This leads to a sparse, local and linear approximation of the feasible set leading in many cases to closed-form updates.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game selection creates cooperative environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of collective cooperation in competitive environments is a well-known phenomenon in biology, economics, and social systems. While most evolutionary game models focus on the evolution of strategies for a fixed game, how strategic decisions coevolve with the environment has so far mostly been overlooked. Here, we consider a game selection model where not only the strategies but also the game can change over time following evolutionary principles. Our results show that coevolutionary dynamics of games and strategies can induce novel collective phenomena, fostering the emergence of cooperative environments. When the model is taken on structured populations the architecture of the interaction network can significantly amplify pro-social behavior, with a critical role played by network heterogeneity and the presence of clustered groups of similar players, distinctive features observed in real-world populations. By unveiling the link between the evolution of strategies and games for different structured populations, our model sheds new light on the origin of social dilemmas ubiquitously observed in real-world social systems.</description>

      <title>Can smartphone apps reveal fishing catch rates and durations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable angler behavior data is important for effective fisheries management. Traditionally, such data is gathered through surveys, but an innovative cost-effective approach involves utilizing online platforms and smartphone applications. Previous studies have identified correlations between citizen-reported data from these applications and conventional survey information. However, it remains unclear whether conventional survey data is directly related to citizen-reported data or mainly derived from "intermediate" variables. We applied Bayesian networks to data from conventional surveys, the Angler's Atlas website, the MyCatch smartphone application, and environmental data across Alberta and Ontario, Canada, to detect probabilistic dependencies. Using Bayesian model averaging, we measured the strength of connections between variables. In Ontario, aerial boat counts were directly related to waterbody webpage views, with a 51% probability. In Alberta, creel survey-reported catch rate was directly related to citizen-reported catch rate and fishing duration, though with low probabilities (12% and 6%, respectively). Daily fishing durations were indirectly related, with air temperature and solar radiation as intermediates. These findings suggest that citizen reports can complement traditional methods for evaluating angler behavior.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics: the relative importance of efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values of 8 cents/kWh. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>

      <title>Preparing Fermilab to Carry Out the P5 Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>
