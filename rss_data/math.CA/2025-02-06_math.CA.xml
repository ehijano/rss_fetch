      <title>Survey on bilinear spherical averages and associated maximal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we collect recent progress in the understanding of $L^{p}$ bounds for bilinear spherical averages and some associated maximal functions like the bilinear spherical maximal function and its lacunary counterpart. We describe necessary conditions satisfied by triples in the $L^{p}$ improving region of a bilinear spherical averaging operator and the localized bilinear spherical maximal function, as well as describe the best-known boundedness regions to date. We state some open questions along the way to motivate future research on this topic, and we exploit some possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Improved $L^p$ bounds for the strong spherical maximal operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^p$ mapping properties of the strong spherical maximal function, which is a multiparameter generalisation of Stein's spherical maximal function. We show that this operator is bounded on $L^p$ for $p &gt; 2$ in all dimensions $n \geq 3$. This matches the conjectured sharp range $p&gt;(n+1)/(n-1)$ when $n=3$. For $n=2$ the analogous estimate was recently proved by Chen, Guo and Yang.
  Our result builds upon and improves an earlier bound of Lee, Lee and Oh. The main novelty is an estimate in discretised incidence geometry that bounds the volume of the intersection of thin neighbourhoods of axis-parallel ellipsoids. This estimate is then interpolated with the Fourier analytic $L^p$-Sobolev estimates of Lee, Lee and Oh.</description>

      <title>Signature Reconstruction from Randomized Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled ordinary differential equations driven by continuous bounded variation curves can be considered a continuous time analogue of recurrent neural networks for the construction of expressive features of the input curves. We ask up to which extent well known signature features of such curves can be reconstructed from controlled ordinary differential equations with (untrained) random vector fields. The answer turns out to be algebraically involved, but essentially the number of signature features, which can be reconstructed from the non-linear flow of the controlled ordinary differential equation, is exponential in its hidden dimension, when the vector fields are chosen to be neural with depth two. Moreover, we characterize a general linear independence condition on arbitrary vector fields, under which the signature features up to some fixed order can always be reconstructed. Algebraically speaking this complements in a quantitative manner several well known results from the theory of Lie algebras of vector fields and puts them in a context of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimension I: Criterion for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of dynamically defined Cantor sets in arbitrary dimensions, introducing a criterion for $\mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha}$ stable intersections of such Cantor sets, under a mild bunching condition. This condition is naturally satisfied for perturbations of conformal Cantor sets and, in particular, always holds in dimension one. Our work extends the celebrated recurrent compact set criterion of Moreira and Yoccoz for stable intersection of Cantor sets in the real line to higher-dimensional spaces. Based on this criterion, we develop a method for constructing explicit examples of stably intersecting Cantor sets in any dimension. This construction operates in the most fragile and critical regimes, where the Hausdorff dimension of one of the Cantor sets is arbitrarily small and both Cantor sets are nearly homothetical. All results and examples are provided in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <title>Exponentials rarely maximize Fourier extension inequalities for cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of maximizers and the precompactness of $L^p$-normalized maximizing sequences modulo symmetries for all valid scale-invariant Fourier extension inequalities on the cone in $\mathbb R^{1+d}$. In the range for which such inequalities are conjectural, our result is conditional on the boundedness of the extension operator. Global maximizers for the $L^2$ Fourier extension inequality on the cone in $\mathbb R^{1+d}$ have been characterized in the lowest-dimensional cases $d\in\{2,3\}$. We further prove that these functions are critical points for the $L^p$ to $L^q$ Fourier extension inequality if and only if $p = 2$.</description>

      <title>On classical orthogonal polynomials on bi-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45 (2012)], while looking for spin chains that admit perfect state transfer, Vinet and Zhedanov found an apparently new sequence of orthogonal polynomials, that they called para-Krawtchouk polynomials, defined on a bilinear lattice. In this note we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the regularity of solutions of the corresponding functional equation. Moreover, the functional Rodrigues formula and a closed formula for the recurrence coefficients are presented. As a consequence, we characterize all solutions of the functional equation, including as very particular cases the Meixner, Charlier, Krawtchouk, Hahn, and para-Krawtchouk polynomials.</description>
