      <title>Torsional Effects in the Coupling between Gravity and Spinors -- Yukawa Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17158v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spinors in the framework of general relativity, starting from the Dirac field Lagrangian in the approximation of weak gravity. We focus on how fermions couple to gravity through the spin connection, and we analyze these couplings by analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau model and the Yukawa interaction known from the Higgs mechanism. By solving the field equations, we explore how these couplings affect the spacetime metric. In particular, torsion generated by fermionic spin currents naturally emerges and leads to the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. As a consequence, gravity acquires a mass and fermions gain additional mass contributions through their interaction with this gravitational field. These effects are localized and diminish quickly with distance. Our model offers an alternative explanation to phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy. We link these cosmological effects to chirality-flip processes of Majorana neutrinos interacting with a massive graviton. Right-handed Majorana neutrinos, which are sterile under Standard Model interactions, generate repulsive gravitational curvature and act as a source of dark energy, while left-handed neutrinos contribute to attractive gravitational effects akin to dark matter. The spin-gravity coupling modifies the curvature of spacetime, influencing galaxy rotation, the accelerated expansion of the universe, and the bending of light. In short, the intrinsic spin of fermions, when coupled to gravity via torsion, changes gravity from a long-range, massless force to a short-range, massive one. This new framework provides fresh insights into fundamental physics and cosmology, potentially explaining dark matter and dark energy phenomena through spin-related gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar field perturbations of 4D de Sitter Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with de Sitter (dS) asymptotics. Our study focuses on the various branches of quasinormal modes present in this background, employing the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We identify that the introduction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ gives rise to three branches of modes: the perturbative (in $\alpha$) Schwarzschild branch, the perturbative (in $\alpha$) dS branch, and a non-perturbative (in $\alpha$) dS branch. Our results show that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background. Furthermore, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant induces significant deviations in the Schwarzschild branch and smaller deviations in the perturbative dS branch compared to the corresponding branches in the Schwarzschild-dS limit. Additionally, the non-perturbative dS branch of modes, absent when $\alpha=0$, emerges as a novel feature of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet framework.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical approach to the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiclassical depiction of gravity has provided many important results, such as particle creation effects in expanding universes and in spacetimes containing black holes. However, many questions remain open, most notably concerning the final product of the black hole evaporation process and the conservation of information. From a pedagogical perspective, we review the concepts that lead to this state of affairs, also known as the black hole information problem, and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. Stating the necessary conjectures and results that lead to the geometrical properties of black holes, we present the notion of black hole evaporation and the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory under the Hadamard condition. We then show that the formation and complete evaporation of a black hole leads to information loss. Comparing such a result to the main alternatives to this non-unitary dynamical evolution, we formulate the black hole information problem and show that information loss is a genuine prediction if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Einstein Maxwell Scalar Black Hole: Thermodynamic Properties with Logarithmic Barrow Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of black holes (BHs) within the Einstein Maxwell Scalar (EMS) framework, incorporating Barrow entropy and its logarithmic corrections to analyze quantum gravity effects is investigated here. A static, spherically symmetric BH solution is obtained by coupling the scalar field nonminimally to the electromagnetic field through a scalar dependent function. The thermodynamic properties including temperature, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy are derived and explored in the context of Barrow-modified entropy. We identify phase transitions and critical behavior by analyzing PV criticality and uncover the influence of scalar and electric charges on stability. Furthermore, the Joule Thomson expansion is examined to understand the inversion behavior and thermodynamic responses under adiabatic expansion. Our findings suggest the presence of thermodynamic instabilities, remnants, and nontrivial critical phenomena, providing new insights into BH thermodynamics in modified gravity scenarios with quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Free Hyperboloidal Evolution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulations of the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system on compactified hyperboloidal slices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this setup is evolved with a common formulation like BSSN/Z4. Hyperboloidal slices smoothly reach future null infinity, the only location in spacetime where radiation (such as gravitational waves) is unambiguously defined. We are thus able to reach null infinity and extract signals there. We showcase the capabilities of our implementation in spherical symmetry with the evolution of a charged scalar field perturbing a regular spacetime and near an electrically charged black hole. We also present the collapse of a charged scalar field into a Reissner-N\"ordstrom black hole.</description>

      <title>On the bound states of the Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical significance and spectral stability of black hole quasinormal modes is fundamental to high-precision spectroscopy with future gravitational wave detectors. Inspired by Mashhoon's idea of relating quasinormal modes of black holes with their equivalent bound states in an inverted potential, we investigate, for the first time, energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Schwarzschild black hole quantitatively. While quasinormal modes describe the characteristic damped oscillations of a black hole, the bound states of the inverted potential are qualitatively more similar to those of the hydrogen atom. Although the physical interpretation of these states may initially be of more academic interest, it furthers our understanding of open problems related to quasinormal modes in a similar spirit to Maggiore's interpretation of the Schwarzschild quasinormal mode spectrum. One surprising insight from the explicit calculation of bound states is that eigenfunctions corresponding to quasinormal mode overtones become rapidly delocalized and extremely loosely bound. This observation raises immediate questions about the common interpretation of quasinormal modes as excitations of the lightring region. Closely related, as a second application, we also explore the spectral stability of bound states and demonstrate that they can provide complementary insights into the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Love Beyond the Horizon: A Bridge to Recovering Information from Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide further evidence that information is preserved during black hole evaporation and may be recoverable, provided quantum gravitational effects resolve the singularity. We demonstrate that due to quantum gravity effects, black holes acquire quantum hair, manifested by non-zero tidal Love numbers, revealing a distinct internal structure similar to neutron stars. Interestingly, the magnitude of these Love numbers is Planck-scale suppressed, implying significant tidal deformation in the late stage of evaporation. Depending on the final state of the black hole, information may be retrieved through correlations in Hawking radiation, baby universes, or via remnants.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the black hole information problem and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. As the problem arises in the framework of semiclassical gravity, we first review the necessary notions to describe Lorentzian manifolds equipped with physical properties, as well as the physical concepts of the theory that describes the gravitational interaction as the curvature of spacetime, general relativity. From its classical perspective, we develop the formalism to study the dynamical aspects of black holes in spacetimes obeying suitable causality conditions. Equipped with conjectures that nature censors naked singularities and that black holes reach a stationary configuration after they form, the black hole uniqueness theorems allow us to review several relations for the geometrical quantities associated with them. Following considerations of the other fundamental interactions, which are described by quantum field theory, we review the arguments in the formalism of quantum field theory in curved spacetime that give rise to the effective particle creation effect, its approximately thermal character, and the concept of black hole evaporation. With a precise quantification of information in quantum mechanics and assuming that the condition for physically acceptable states is given by the Hadamard condition, we review the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory. As a consequence, we discuss how the formation and complete evaporation of black holes leads to information loss. Conscious that such a prediction follows if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale, we discuss alternatives to this nonunitary dynamical evolution and formulate the black hole information problem. Lastly, we analyze the assumptions and hypotheses that lead to the problem.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of complexity for spherically symmetric fluid composition within the context of modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regardless of the adequate descriptions of complexity in distinct alternative gravity theories, its elaboration in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ theory remains uncertain. The orthogonal splitting of the curvature tensor yields the complexity factor as suggested by Herrera \cite {herrera2018new}. To commence our study, the inner spacetime is assumed to be spherically symmetric static composition comprised of the anisotropic fluid. In this context, we derive the modified field equations for the considered theory and take into account the established relationship between the conformal and curvature tensors to interpret the complexity. Furthermore, we determine the correspondence of the mass functions with the complexity factor, represented by a specific scalar $Y_{TF}$. Certain solutions complying with the precedent of diminishing $Y_{TF}$ are also evaluated. It is noted that celestial formations having anisotropic and non-uniform compositions of matter assert the utmost complexity. Nevertheless, the spherically symmetric matter distribution may not exhibit complexity in the scenario of vanishing impacts of non-homogenous energy density and anisotropic pressure due to the presence of dark source terms associated with this extended gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of Charged Static Black Hole in Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher curvature gravity usually has complicated field equations, and solving them analytically is strenuous. In this work, we obtain an analytical charged black hole (BH) solution in higher curvature gravity using the thermodynamics of black holes and employing the continued fraction expansion. We investigate the thermodynamics of static black holes using the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr formula in their proper form for Einstein-cubic gravity (ECG). Next, we obtain the thermodynamic quantities and show that our results are similar to those from solving the field equations. Then, we study the superradiance of the black hole using massless charged-scalar perturbations. We derive the superradiant conditions and compute the amplification factor through direct integration. We demonstrate how the amplification factor will change as a function of the black hole charge and frequency of the incident wave. We also show that a black hole mass and charge are decreasing in the superradiance region. Finally, we discuss superradiance as a consequence of black hole thermodynamics in ECG.</description>

      <title>The primordial angular power spectrum from the alternative mass function in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological impacts of the alternative effective mass function of the modified Mukhanov-Sasaki equation in loop quantum cosmology, which is obtained from the polymerization of the classical mass function derived in the comoving gauge. This alternative effective mass function is distinct from those in the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches and is able to generate a new structure in the primordial power spectrum. After taking the Starobinsky potential and employing a particular polymerization ansatz for the inverse Hubble rate, the effective mass function is characterized by a free parameter $\xi$. When $\xi \ge 0.1$, there appears a wave-packet structure in the region preceding the almost scale invariant regime of the power spectrum and both the location and the height of the wave packet are affected by the choice of $\xi$. For the angular power spectrum, we find $\xi=0.2$ provides the best-fit curve to the result from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our study presents a concrete example in which the fine structure of the primordial power spectrum sensitively relies on the parameters in the polymerization ansatz.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravastar-like structures with strongly interacting quark matter shell in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity under conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate gravastar-like structures in static and spherically symmetric space-time within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity coupled with conformal symmetry. We have modified the conventional gravastar model by introducing a strongly interacting quark matter shell which maintains the apex of causal limit through the EoS, $p=\rho-2B_{g}$, where, $B_{g}$ is the bag constant. Non-singular and non-vanishing solutions for the interior and shell regions are obtained, respectively. We have used the Israel junction condition to evaluate the mass of the thin shell for different choices of characteristic radii. Interestingly, the mass of the shell is independent of the matter distribution in the shell region. We found that for radii 9.009, 10.009 and 11.009, the mass increases as $1.80,~1.95$ and $2.28~M_{\odot}$. The physical features, such as, proper length, energy and entropy of the shell region are studied within the parameter space. Surface redshift calculations were used to validate the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Continuing Isaacson's Legacy: A general metric theory perspective on gravitational memory and the non-linearity of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of defining a physical notion of gravitational waves, together with the associated dynamical degrees of freedom of a gravity theory, is a long-standing problem that famously lead to the discovery the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) spacetime symmetry at null infinity and its connection to gravitational memory. Here, we show that the second major contribution to an understanding of waves in gravitation, attributed to the work of Isaacson, equally leads to the inevitable presence of displacement memory, and provides additional understanding of the phenomenon. In particular, the Isaacson viewpoint allows for an efficient method to compute gravitational displacement memory in general metric theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Time-frequency structure in the post-merger binary black hole gravitational wave signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from asymmetric binary black hole systems have been shown to exhibit additional chirps beyond the primary merger chirp in the post-merger region of the time-frequency domain. These secondary post-merger chirps correlate to the evolving geometry of the common horizon that forms as the binary merges and were previously studied through numerical relativity simulation in a zero-spin regime. In this work, we investigate the post-merger time-frequency structure in systems with both aligned and precessing spin using widely available waveform models. We find that the inclusion of strong aligned spin $\left(\xi = 0.75\right)$ induces further post-merger time-frequency peaks. Additionally we show that even mild precessing spin $\left(\chi_p = 0.25\right)$ strongly affects the distribution of post-merger radiative power across the celestial sky of the final black hole. Our results support the theory of a correlation between the post-merger signal and horizon geometry.</description>

      <title>Does Unruh effect necessarily imply entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that despite the fact that an accelerating observer would note the Minkowski vacuum to be thermal, which is the well known Unruh's effect, an inconsistency is implied writing the Minkowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges. We first use the textbook derivation showing the Minkowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges as an inspiration to construct alternate spacetimes, where the Minkowski vacuum can be written as a thermofield double state between disconnected regions of spacetime, and show that no thermality is implied by calculations using Bogoluibov coefficients. We next highlight issues in this textbook derivation by first noting the blowing up of Bogoluibov coefficients at $k=0$, followed by showing that that two point correlation function evaluations are inconsistent, despite the thermal nature of the particle spectrum as witnessed by observers following boost orbits. We highlight the reason behind the inconsistency in the derivation as an issue with expanding the relevant fields in a complete set of frequency modes.</description>

      <title>Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects into black holes at the centers of galaxies, so called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. In this study, we introduce a new search strategy that allows us to find EMRI signals in noisy data from wide priors all the way to performing parameter estimation. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract EMRIs from future LISA data.</description>

      <title>Influence of cosmic expansion on gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves undergo redshift as they propagate through the expanding universe, and the redshift may exhibit time-dependent drift. Consequently, for any isolated gravitational wave sources, the mass parameter $\mathcal{M}$ and the redshift $z$ exhibit an observational degeneracy, typically manifesting in the waveform as the redshifted mass $\mathcal{M}(1+z)$. Matching together the wave propagation and the wave generation solutions, we show that dimensionless source parameters depending on mass $\mathcal{M}$ can break this degeneracy. Notably, the postmerger signal from binary neutron stars contains several dimensionless parameters that satisfy this condition, including the quality factors of different frequency components and their frequency ratios. Considering the observations of solely the postmerger signal by the Neutron star Extreme Matter Observatory or the Einstein Telescope, based on the Fisher analysis, we find that the redshift can be measured with fractional uncertainties of $\sim30\%$ for sources at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.09$. Additionally, we present a corrected derivation of the waveform phase correction due to the redshift drift effect, rectifying a sign error in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the standard relativistic geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk in the background of a deformed compact object. The main purpose of this work is to determine whether such a deformed object possesses its own observational fingerprint that can distinguish it from Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Our analysis reveals the properties of this relativistic accretion disk model and its dependence on the initial parameters.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond gravity: Weak Deflection Angle, Shadow cast, Quasinormal Modes and Neutrino annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of electrically charged black holes in a Lorentz-violating gravitational framework mediated by a background Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor field. Employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in a non-asymptotically flat geometry, we derive analytic expressions for the weak deflection angle of light and massive particles, revealing persistent corrections due to the Lorentz-violating parameter $ \ell $. Scalar and Dirac perturbations are also studied using both the WKB approximation and the Poschl-Teller approximation approach to verify the stability of the solution against these types of perturbations. Shadow analysis further uncovers a nontrivial deformation of the photon sphere and critical impact parameter, with KR-induced effects modifying the charge contribution in a manner incompatible with standard Einstein-Maxwell theory. Constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope data for Sgr A* and M87* validate the model and provide stringent bounds on $ \ell $, establishing the KR framework as an observationally testable extension of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During inflation, higher derivative terms in the gravitational action may play a significant role. Building on new stable formulations of four-derivative scalar-tensor theories, we study the impact of these corrections in the case where the inflaton is also the additional scalar degree of freedom of the modified theory. This case is highly restricted by requiring that in the homogeneous limit inflation must still work, and that the initial data must be in the weak coupling limit to respect the validity of the effective theory. In such cases, the non-linear dynamics of large perturbations are very similar to the GR case, with the main deviations captured by the terms relating to the homogeneous Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet contributions. We show that in principle it is possible to dynamically drive the field out of the weak-coupling regime from a starting point well within it, but that to do so one has to finely tune the setup, so such cases are unlikely to occur generically. This work provides a basis for the study of less restricted models in future, for example those in which the inflaton and scalar degree of freedom are independent, or in which one is not restricted to a weakly coupled regime.</description>

      <title>The Noether formalism for constructing conserved quantities in teleparallel equivalents of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper brings a methodological character where we present a comprehensive formalism for constructing conserved quantities in the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR). It was developed in series of our earlier works and, here, we unite it into a complete form. By employing the Noether method within a tensor formalism, conserved currents, superpotentials, and charges are constructed. These are shown to be covariant under coordinate transformations and local Lorentz rotations in TEGR, while in STEGR, they are covariant under coordinate transformations. The teleparallel (flat) connections in both theories are defined using the "turning off gravity" principle. Uniting such defined flat connections with tetrad in TEGR and metric in STEGR a new fruitful in applications notion "gauge" is introduced. The choice of various initial tetrads in TEGR or initial coordinates in STEGR leads to different gauges, what gives different conserved quantities. Finally, we discuss an appropriate choice of gauges from a possible set of them.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Schwinger instability, modular flow, and holographic entropy for near-extremal charged BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a charged scalar field in the near-horizon region of a near-extremal charged BTZ black hole. A controlled expansion of the Einstein-Maxwell equations reveals an emergent warped AdS$_2 \times S^1$ throat geometry threaded by a constant electric field--an ideal setting for studying Schwinger pair production, Hawking radiation, and entropy flow. By solving the Klein-Gordon equation using both tunneling and field-theoretic methods, we compute the pair production rate and identify an effective Unruh-like temperature. In particular, we apply the WKB approximation for Hawking tunneling, justified by the infinite blueshift experienced by outgoing modes near the horizon. Instability arises when local acceleration exceeds the AdS curvature scale, linking near-horizon dynamics to thermal emission. Through the generalized uncertainty principle, which implies the existence of a minimal length, we argue that quantum gravity effects can drive the Hawking and Schwinger-like temperatures to zero. To connect quantum radiation to geometry, we analyze the flux of the modular Hamiltonian across the horizon and show that its variation matches the entropic contribution of the produced pairs. Using Tomita-Takesaki theory and the type II\_\infty von Neumann algebra of horizon observables, we derive a semiclassical gravitational constraint involving the second variation of the stress tensor, recovering the null-null component of the Einstein equations from entropy extremization. The intersection point of inward and outward RT geodesics marks both the peak of pair production and the vanishing of entropy variation, revealing a geometric alignment between entanglement, quantum matter, and backreaction. The near-horizon geometry does not merely support quantum effects--it organizes them.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Cosmic History with Machine Learning: A Study Using CART, MLPR, and SVR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reconstruct cosmic history via supervised learning through three methods: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). For this purpose, we use ages of simulated galaxies based on 32 massive, early-time, passively evolving galaxies in the range $0.12 &lt; z &lt; 1.85$, with absolute ages determined. Using this sample, we simulate subsamples of 100, 1000, 2000, 3334, 6680 points, through the Monte Carlo Method and adopting a Gaussian distribution centering on a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM as a fiducial model. We found that the SVR method demonstrates the best performance during the process. The methods MLPR and CART also present satisfactory performance, but their mean square errors are greater than those found for the SVR. Using the reconstructed ages, we estimate the matter density parameter and equation of state (EoS) and our analysis found the SVR with 600 predict points obtains $\Omega_m=0.329\pm{}^{0.010}_{0.010}$ and the dark energy EoS parameter $\omega= -1.054\pm{}^{0.087}_{0.126}$, which are consistent with the values from the literature. We highlight that we found the most consistent results for the subsample with 2000 points, which returns 600 predicted points and has the best performance, considering its small sample size and high accuracy. We present the reconstructed curves of galaxy ages and the best fits cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang &amp; Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$ is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$.
  Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation models than the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements favor a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, a positive running $\alpha_s$, and a smaller slow-roll parameter $\eta$. Even in the absence of PBH production, the updated constraints together place many single-field models under tension with the CMB data. To explore this tension, we study PBH formation in an $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the new bounds for CMB observables. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$ that are disfavored by the new bounds. A possible model-building approach to resolve the tension is proposed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational wave production at strong first order phase transitions, with large-scale, long-running simulations of a system with a scalar order parameter and a relativistic fluid. One transition proceeds by detonations with asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.92$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.67$, and the other by deflagrations, with a nominal asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.44$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.5$. We investigate in detail the power spectra of velocity and shear stress and - for the first time in a phase transition simulation - their time decorrelation, which is essential for the understanding of gravitational wave production. In the detonation, the decorrelation speed is larger than the sound speed over a wide range of wavenumbers in the inertial range, supporting a visual impression of a flow dominated by supersonic shocks. Vortical modes do not contribute greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases, we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the flow. The gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. For both cases this is approximately $\tilde{\Omega}^\infty_\text{gw} \simeq 0.017$, even though they have quite different kinetic energy densities. The corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, for flows which decay in much less than a Hubble time, is $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(4.8\pm1.1)\times 10^{-8}$ for the detonation, and $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(1.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-8}$ for the deflagration.</description>

      <title>First astrometric constraints on parity-violation in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of stellar positions and velocities, offers a promising approach to probing the low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Notably, astrometric vector sky maps are sensitive to parity-violating SGWB signals, which cannot be distinguished using pulsar timing array observations in an isotropic SGWB. We present the first astrometric constraints on parity-violating SGWB using quasar catalogs from Gaia DR3 and VLBA data. By analyzing the $EB$ correlation in the two-point correlation function of the proper motions of the quasars, we find 2$\sigma$ constraints on the parity-violating SGWB amplitude $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.020 \pm 0.025$ from Gaia DR3 and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.004 \pm 0.010$ from VLBA. These constraints are valid in the frequency range $4.2 \times 10^{-18}\,{\rm Hz} &lt; f &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{-8}\,{\rm Hz}$. Although not currently a tight constraint on theoretical models, this first attempt lays the groundwork for future investigations using more precise astrometric data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Multipole Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the effect of scattering gravitational radiation off the static background curvature, up to second order in Newton constant, known in literature as tail and tail-of-tail processes, for generic electric and magnetic multipoles. Starting from the multipole expansion of composite compact objects, and as expected due to the known electric quadrupole case, both long- and short-distance (UV) divergences are encountered. The former disappears from properly defined observables, the latter are renormalized and their associated logarithms give rise to a classical renormalization group flow. UV divergences alert for incompleteness of the multipolar description of the composite source, and are expected not to be present in a UV-complete theory, as explicitly derived in literature for the case of conservative dynamics. Logarithmic terms from tail-of-tail processes associated to generic magnetic multipoles are computed in this work for the first time.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle structure in Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12927v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to provide a rigorous geometric framework for the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity. As the starting point of this formulation consists in recasting General Relativity as an SU(2) gauge theory, it naturally lends itself to interpretation within the theory of principal bundles. The foundation of our framework is the spin structure, which connects the principal SU(2)-bundle construction with the Riemannian framework. The existence of the spin structure enlightens the geometric properties of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection and the topological characteristics of the manifold. Within this framework, we are able to express the constraints of the physical theory in a coordinate-free way, using vector-valued forms that acquire a clear geometric interpretation.
  Using these geometric concepts, we analyze the phase space of the theory and discuss the implementation of symmetries through the automorphism group of the principal SU(2)-bundle. In particular, we demonstrate that the description of the kinematical constraints as vector-valued forms provides a natural implementation as momentum maps for the automorphism group action.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection limit analysis of black hole lensing in inhomogeneous plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07703v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing effects in the presence of plasma in the strong deflection limit, which corresponds to light rays circling around a compact object and forming higher-order images. While previous studies of this case have predominantly focused on the deflection of light in a vacuum or in the presence of a homogeneous plasma, this work introduces an analytical treatment for the influence of a non-uniform plasma. After recalling the exact expression for the deflection angle of photons in a static, asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime filled with cold non-magnetized plasma, a strong deflection limit analysis is presented. Particular attention is then given to the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, where the deflection angle of photons for different density profiles of plasma is obtained. Moreover, perturbative results for an arbitrary power-law radial density profile are also presented. These formulae are then applied to the calculation of the positions and magnifications of higher-order images, concluding that the presence of a non-uniform plasma reduces both their angular size and their magnifications, at least within the range of the power-law indices considered. These findings contribute to the understanding of gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma, offering a versatile framework applicable to various asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold--Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm. The idea of coupling constant metamorphosis is also applied to the Myers--Perry metric -- a five dimensional generalization of Kerr's metric. The case of single rotation parameter is considered in some detail.</description>

Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate it in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Actions of spinning compact binaries: Spinning particle in Kerr matched to dynamics at 1.5 post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of compact binaries is influenced by the spin of their components starting at the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. On the other hand, in the large mass ratio limit, the spin of the lighter object appears in the equations of motion at first order in the mass ratio, coinciding with the leading gravitational self-force. Frame and gauge choices make it challenging to compare between the two limits, especially for generic spin configurations. We derive novel closed formulas for the gauge-invariant actions and frequencies for the motion of spinning test particles near Kerr black holes. We use this to express the Hamiltonian perturbatively in terms of action variables up to 3PN and compare it with the 1.5 PN action-angle Hamiltonian at finite mass ratios. This allows us to match the actions across both systems, providing a new gauge-invariant dictionary for interpolation between the two limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near a gravitating compact object, massive particles traveling along timelike geodesics are gravitationally deflected similarly to light. In this paper, we study the deflection angles of these particles in the strong deflection limit. This analytical approximation applies when particles in unbound orbits approach the compact object very closely, circle around it at a radius close to that of the unstable circular orbit, and eventually escape. While previous studies have provided results for particular metrics, we offer a general solution applicable to any static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. After briefly reviewing the exact expression for the deflection angle of massive particles, we present a strong deflection limit analysis for this general case. The developed formulas are then applied to three particular metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Janis-Newman-Winicour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the self-force acting on a pointlike (electromagnetic or conformal-scalar) charge held fixed on a spacetime with a spherically-symmetric mass distribution of constant density (the Schwarzschild star). The Schwarzschild interior is shown to be conformal to a three-sphere geometry; we use this conformal symmetry to obtain closed-form expressions for mode solutions. We calculate the self-force with two complementary regularization methods, direct and difference regularization, showing agreement. For the first time, we show that difference regularization can be applied in the non-vacuum interior region, due to the vanishing of certain regularized mode sums. The new results for the self-force come in three forms: series expansions for the self-force near the centre of the star and in the far field; a new approximation that describes the divergence in the self-force near the star's boundary; and numerical data presented in a selection of plots. We conclude with a discussion of the logarithmic divergence in the self-force in the approach to the star's surface, and the effect of boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. Using the approach to renormalization established previously for the energy density in two space dimensions, we extend those calculations to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor, including its contribution to the null energy condition for radial geodesics. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved spacetime, including the effects of the conformal anomaly. This model provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics in the extended phase space of a quantum corrected black hole (BH) proposed recently is presented in this work. Our study shows that the phase transition behavior of the BH is analogous to that of conventional Schwarzschild BH in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space; however, a critical temperature exists such that when the BH temperature exceeds this critical value, the small BH phase and the large BH phase become separated, and no phase transition occurs. Due to the introduction of the quantum parameter $\xi$, the BH equation of state splits into two branches. One branch reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS case as $\xi\to0$, with its phase transition pressure lower than the critical pressure; another branch's phase transition pressure is greater than the critical pressure. The study shows that the $T-r_{+}$ phase transition and heat capacity are similar to those of the Schwarzschild-AdS BH. The Joule-Thomson expansion is divided into two stages: in the earlier stage, the BH pressure increases until it reaches a maximum; in the later stage, the pressure gradually decreases. In each stage, the BH may undergo an inversion point, resulting in the inversion curve with two branches. In addition, each stage has a minimum inversion mass, below which any BH (in each respective stage) has no inversion point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a major update to the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration's catalog of binary black hole simulations. Using highly efficient spectral methods implemented in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), we have nearly doubled the total number of binary configurations from 2,018 to 3,756. The catalog now densely covers the parameter space with precessing simulations up to mass ratio $q=8$ and dimensionless spins up to $|\vec{\chi}|\le0.8$ with near-zero eccentricity. The catalog also includes some simulations at higher mass ratios with moderate spin and more than 250 eccentric simulations. We have also deprecated and rerun some simulations from our previous catalog (e.g., simulations run with a much older version of SpEC or that had anomalously high errors in the waveform). The median waveform difference (which is similar to the mismatch) between resolutions over the simulations in the catalog is $4\times10^{-4}$. The simulations have a median of 22 orbits, while the longest simulation has 148 orbits. We have corrected each waveform in the catalog to be in the binary's center-of-mass frame and exhibit gravitational-wave memory. We estimate the total CPU cost of all simulations in the catalog to be 480,000,000 core-hours. We find that using spectral methods for binary black hole simulations is over 1,000 times more efficient than much shorter finite-difference simulations of comparable accuracy. The full catalog is publicly available through the sxs Python package and at https://data.black-holes.org .</description>

      <title>Study on physical properties and characteristics of an anisotropic compact star model using Karmarkar Condition in F(Q) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of physical parameters of an anisotropic compact star model demonstrating spherical symmetry in F(Q) modified gravity. To evaluate the behaviour and the stability of an anisotropic compact star model, we utilise the measured mass and radius of an anisotropic compact star model. This study obtained an anisotropic compact star model by solving Einstein field equations. The field equations have been simplified by an appropriate selection of the metric elements and the Karmarkar condition. By solving the field equation to develop a differential equation that establishes a relationship between two essential components of spacetime. A physical analysis of this model reveals that the resulting stellar structure for anisotropic matter distribution is a physically plausible representation of a compact star with an energy density of order $10^14 g/cm^3$. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov Condition, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and stability of the compact star Cen X-3. We further determined the mass-radius relation of this compact star for different values of delta}1.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Detection Pipelines of Taiji: New Challenges in Data Analysis and High-Fidelity Simulations of Space-Borne Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16500</link>

Abstract: Taiji, a Chinese space-based gravitational wave detection project, aims to explore the millihertz gravitational wave universe with unprecedented sensitivity, targeting astrophysical and cosmological sources including Galactic binaries, massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, etc. These observations are expected to provide transformative insights into astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. However, Taiji's data analysis faces unique challenges distinct from ground-based detectors like LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, such as the overlap of numerous signals, extended data durations, more rigorous accuracy requirements for the waveform templates, non-negligible subdominant waveform complexities, incompletely characterized noise spectra, non-stationary noises, and various data anomalies. This paper presents the second round of Taiji Data Challenge, a collection of simulation datasets designed as a shared platform for resolving these critical data analysis problems. The current platform distinguishes from previous works by the systematic integration of orbital dynamics based on the full drag-free and attitude control simulation, extended noise sources, more sophisticated and overlapping gravitational wave signals, second-generation time-delay interferometry and the coupling effect of time-varying armlengths, etc. Concurrently released is the open-source toolkit Triangle (available at https://github.com/TriangleDataCenter), which offers the capabilities for customized simulation of signals, noises and other instrumental effects. By taking a step further towards realistic detection, Taiji Data Challenge II and Triangle altogether serve as a new testbed, supporting the development of Taiji's global analysis and end-to-end pipelines, and ultimately bridging the gaps between observation and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Quintessence: an analytical study, with theoretical and observational applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models, of thawing type, and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytic expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$ in terms of matter evolution; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Using finally the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytic bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Coupled-Channel Eikonal Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emitted radiation and absorption effects in black hole dynamics lead to inelastic scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study how these effects introduce an inelasticity function to the $2\rightarrow2$ eikonalised $S$-matrix and how they can be described using unequal mass and spin on-shell amplitudes. To achieve this, we formulate the inelastic coupled-channel eikonal (ICCE) using the KMOC formalism and the language of quantum channels, where off-diagonal channels involve mass and spin changes. This formulation allows us to re-use usual eikonal results but also suggests a different resummation of inelastic effects. We then apply this formulation to calculate classical inelastic processes, such as the mass change in binary dynamics due to the presence of an event horizon. Additionally, we provide a complementary analysis for the case of wave scattering on a black hole, considering absorption effects. In both scenarios, we derive unitarity relations accounting for inelastic effects.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>It costs nothing to teleport information into a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</description>

      <title>Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of primordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level of the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT predictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the EFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial oscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the well-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation processes. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy power spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to derive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work highlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios on scales that complement CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Conformal boundaries near extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <title>The Long Road to Alignment: Measuring Black Hole Spin Orientation with Expanding Gravitational-Wave Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the distribution of spin tilts-the angles between the spin vectors and the binary orbital angular momentum-in stellar-mass binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA would provide valuable insight into their astrophysical origins. Analyses of the 69 binary black holes detected through LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third observing run yielded model-dependent conclusions, particularly regarding whether the spin tilt distribution exhibits a peak near alignment, as expected for binaries formed in galactic fields. In this work, we simulate populations of up to 1500 binary black hole systems with parameters consistent with the default GWTC-3 analysis, while introducing a correlation that favors small spin tilts for binaries with mass ratios near unity. We find that: (a) spurious peaks away from perfect alignment are possible even with catalogs of up to 300 sources; (b) establishing a definitive peak at alignment remains difficult even with 1500 detections; (c) integrated measurements -- such as the fraction of events with tilt angles smaller than $10^\circ$ or greater than $90^\circ$ -- are more robust and should be preferred, achieving relative $90\%$ credible uncertainties of $\sim20\%-80\%$ with 1500 sources; and (d) even with the largest simulated catalogs, evidence for a mass ratio-tilt correlation remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that identifying the formation channels of merging black holes using spin tilts will remain challenging, but that model-independent measurements may yield more informative insights over model parameters themselves.</description>
