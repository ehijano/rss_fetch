      <title>An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Locating Manipulated Region in partially fake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the task of locating manipulation regions in partially-fake audio (PFA) involves cross-domain datasets, the performance of deep learning models drops significantly due to the shift between the source and target domains. To address this issue, existing approaches often employ data augmentation before training. However, they overlook the characteristics in target domain that are absent in source domain. Inspired by the mixture-of-experts model, we propose an unsupervised method named Samples mining with Diversity and Entropy (SDE). Our method first learns from a collection of diverse experts that achieve great performance from different perspectives in the source domain, but with ambiguity on target samples. We leverage these diverse experts to select the most informative samples by calculating their entropy. Furthermore, we introduced a label generation method tailored for these selected samples that are incorporated in the training process in source domain integrating the target domain information. We applied our method to a cross-domain partially fake audio detection dataset, ADD2023Track2. By introducing 10% of unknown samples from the target domain, we achieved an F1 score of 43.84%, which represents a relative increase of 77.2% compared to the second-best method.</description>

      <title>Adversarial-MidiBERT: Symbolic Music Understanding Model Based on Unbias Pre-training and Mask Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important part of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Symbolic Music Understanding (SMU) has gained substantial attention, as it can assist musicians and amateurs in learning and creating music. Recently, pre-trained language models have been widely adopted in SMU because the symbolic music shares a huge similarity with natural language, and the pre-trained manner also helps make full use of limited music data. However, the issue of bias, such as sexism, ageism, and racism, has been observed in pre-trained language models, which is attributed to the imbalanced distribution of training data. It also has a significant influence on the performance of downstream tasks, which also happens in SMU. To address this challenge, we propose Adversarial-MidiBERT, a symbolic music understanding model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We introduce an unbiased pre-training method based on adversarial learning to minimize the participation of tokens that lead to biases during training. Furthermore, we propose a mask fine-tuning method to narrow the data gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, which can help the model converge faster and perform better. We evaluate our method on four music understanding tasks, and our approach demonstrates excellent performance in all of them. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/Adversarial-MidiBERT.</description>

      <title>From Real to Cloned Singer Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloned voices of popular singers sound increasingly realistic and have gained popularity over the past few years. They however pose a threat to the industry due to personality rights concerns. As such, methods to identify the original singer in synthetic voices are needed. In this paper, we investigate how singer identification methods could be used for such a task. We present three embedding models that are trained using a singer-level contrastive learning scheme, where positive pairs consist of segments with vocals from the same singers. These segments can be mixtures for the first model, vocals for the second, and both for the third. We demonstrate that all three models are highly capable of identifying real singers. However, their performance deteriorates when classifying cloned versions of singers in our evaluation set. This is especially true for models that use mixtures as an input. These findings highlight the need to understand the biases that exist within singer identification systems, and how they can influence the identification of voice deepfakes in music.</description>

      <title>Speech dereverberation constrained on room impulse response characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-channel speech dereverberation aims at extracting a dry speech signal from a recording affected by the acoustic reflections in a room. However, most current deep learning-based approaches for speech dereverberation are not interpretable for room acoustics, and can be considered as black-box systems in that regard. In this work, we address this problem by regularizing the training loss using a novel physical coherence loss which encourages the room impulse response (RIR) induced by the dereverberated output of the model to match the acoustic properties of the room in which the signal was recorded. Our investigation demonstrates the preservation of the original dereverberated signal alongside the provision of a more physically coherent RIR.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and comparative evaluation of three voice command pipelines for controlling a Tello drone, using speech recognition and deep learning techniques. The aim is to enhance human-machine interaction by enabling intuitive voice control of drone actions. The pipelines developed include: (1) a traditional Speech-to-Text (STT) followed by a Large Language Model (LLM) approach, (2) a direct voice-to-function mapping model, and (3) a Siamese neural network-based system. Each pipeline was evaluated based on inference time, accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility. Detailed methodologies, dataset preparation, and evaluation metrics are provided, offering a comprehensive analysis of each pipeline's strengths and applicability across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>ElasticAST: An Audio Spectrogram Transformer for All Length and Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have rapidly overtaken CNN-based architectures as the new standard in audio classification. Transformer-based models, such as the Audio Spectrogram Transformers (AST), also inherit the fixed-size input paradigm from CNNs. However, this leads to performance degradation for ASTs in the inference when input lengths vary from the training. This paper introduces an approach that enables the use of variable-length audio inputs with AST models during both training and inference. By employing sequence packing, our method ElasticAST, accommodates any audio length during training, thereby offering flexibility across all lengths and resolutions at the inference. This flexibility allows ElasticAST to maintain evaluation capabilities at various lengths or resolutions and achieve similar performance to standard ASTs trained at specific lengths or resolutions. Moreover, experiments demonstrate ElasticAST's better performance when trained and evaluated on native-length audio datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI technology has made audio deepfakes remarkably more realistic. While current research on anti-spoofing systems primarily focuses on assessing whether a given audio sample is fake or genuine, there has been limited attention on discerning the specific techniques to create the audio deepfakes. Algorithms commonly used in audio deepfake generation, like text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), undergo distinct stages including input processing, acoustic modeling, and waveform generation. In this work, we introduce a system designed to classify various spoofing attributes, capturing the distinctive features of individual modules throughout the entire generation pipeline. We evaluate our system on two datasets: the ASVspoof 2019 Logical Access and the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD). Results from both experiments demonstrate the robustness of the system to identify the different spoofing attributes of deepfake generation systems.</description>

      <title>Phonetic Richness for Improved Automatic Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When it comes to authentication in speaker verification systems, not all utterances are created equal. It is essential to estimate the quality of test utterances in order to account for varying acoustic conditions. In addition to the net-speech duration of an utterance, it is observed in this paper that phonetic richness is also a key indicator of utterance quality, playing a significant role in accurate speaker verification. Several phonetic histogram based formulations of phonetic richness are explored using transcripts obtained from an automatic speaker recognition system. The proposed phonetic richness measure is found to be positively correlated with voice authentication scores across evaluation benchmarks. Additionally, the proposed measure in combination with net speech helps in calibrating the speaker verification scores, obtaining a relative EER improvement of 5.8% on the Voxceleb1 evaluation protocol. The proposed phonetic richness based calibration provides higher benefit for short utterances with repeated words.</description>

      <title>Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer for Audio-Visual Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spiking neural networks (SNNs) that efficiently encode temporal sequences have shown great potential in extracting audio-visual joint feature representations. However, coupling SNNs (binary spike sequences) with transformers (float-point sequences) to jointly explore the temporal-semantic information still facing challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer (STFT) for audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL). The STFT leverage the temporal and semantic information from different time steps to generate robust representations. The time-step factor (TSF) is introduced to dynamically synthesis the subsequent inference information. To guide the formation of input membrane potentials and reduce the spike noise, we propose a global-local pooling (GLP) which combines the max and average pooling operations. Furthermore, the thresholds of the spiking neurons are dynamically adjusted based on semantic and temporal cues. Integrating the temporal and semantic information extracted by SNNs and Transformers are difficult due to the increased number of parameters in a straightforward bilinear model. To address this, we introduce a temporal-semantic Tucker fusion module, which achieves multi-scale fusion of SNN and Transformer outputs while maintaining full second-order interactions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance in three benchmark datasets. The harmonic mean (HM) improvement of VGGSound, UCF101 and ActivityNet are around 15.4\%, 3.9\%, and 14.9\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Speech Synthesis without Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MELLE, a novel continuous-valued tokens based language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which are originally designed for audio compression and sacrifice fidelity compared to mel-spectrograms. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens. (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language models VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling discrete codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, and, most importantly, offers a more streamlined paradigm. See https://aka.ms/melle for demos of our work.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modality: A Knowledge-Transfer Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify the emotions expressed by individuals through visual, language, and acoustic cues. However, most of the existing research efforts assume that all modalities are available during both training and testing, making their algorithms susceptible to the missing modality scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-transfer network to translate between different modalities to reconstruct the missing audio modalities. Moreover, we develop a cross-modality attention mechanism to retain the maximal information of the reconstructed and observed modalities for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to the previous methods with complete multi-modality supervision.</description>

      <title>MuDiT &amp; MuSiT: Alignment with Colloquial Expression in Description-to-Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amid the rising intersection of generative AI and human artistic processes, this study probes the critical yet less-explored terrain of alignment in human-centric automatic song composition. We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions. This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms. Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies. To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions. Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results. Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation. This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results. MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation. The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.</description>

      <title>FunAudioLLM: Voice Understanding and Generation Foundation Models for Natural Interaction Between Humans and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report introduces FunAudioLLM, a model family designed to enhance natural voice interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs). At its core are two innovative models: SenseVoice, which handles multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and audio event detection; and CosyVoice, which facilitates natural speech generation with control over multiple languages, timbre, speaking style, and speaker identity. SenseVoice-Small delivers exceptionally low-latency ASR for 5 languages, and SenseVoice-Large supports high-precision ASR for over 50 languages, while CosyVoice excels in multi-lingual voice generation, zero-shot in-context learning, cross-lingual voice cloning, and instruction-following capabilities. The models related to SenseVoice and CosyVoice have been open-sourced on Modelscope and Huggingface, along with the corresponding training, inference, and fine-tuning codes released on GitHub. By integrating these models with LLMs, FunAudioLLM enables applications such as speech-to-speech translation, emotional voice chat, interactive podcasts, and expressive audiobook narration, thereby pushing the boundaries of voice interaction technology. Demos are available at https://fun-audio-llm.github.io, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Enhancement by Integrating Inter-Channel and Band Features with Dual-branch Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have been demonstrated to efficaciously capture time-frequency (T-F) information on spectrogram. However, the correlation of each channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each channel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels contains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named channel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively explores the long range time and frequency correlations among different channels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency information. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset demonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the significance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Based on Feature Disentanglement and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice in a given music piece to another singer while keeping the original content. We propose an end-to-end feature disentanglement-based model, which we named SaMoye, to enable zero-shot many-to-many singing voice conversion. SaMoye disentangles the features of the singing voice into content features, timbre features, and pitch features respectively. The content features are enhanced using a GPT-based model to perform cross-prediction with the phoneme of the lyrics. SaMoye can generate the music with converted voice by replacing the timbre features with the target singer. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance. The dataset consists of 1500k pure singing vocal clips containing at least 10,000 singers.</description>

      <title>SummaryMixing: A Linear-Complexity Alternative to Self-Attention for Speech Recognition and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern speech processing systems rely on self-attention. Unfortunately, token mixing with self-attention takes quadratic time in the length of the speech utterance, slowing down inference and training and increasing memory consumption. Cheaper alternatives to self-attention for ASR have been developed, but they fail to consistently reach the same level of accuracy. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel linear-time alternative to self-attention. It summarises an utterance with the mean over vectors for all time steps. This single summary is then combined with time-specific information. We call this method "SummaryMixing". Introducing SummaryMixing in state-of-the-art ASR models makes it feasible to preserve or exceed previous speech recognition performance while making training and inference up to 28% faster and reducing memory use by half.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Disturbance Sensing Level Detection for ASD Diagnosis and Intelligibility Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acoustic sensitivity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals highly impacts their intelligibility in noisy urban environments. In this Letter, the disturbance sensing level is examined with perceptual listening tests that demonstrate the impact of their append High Internal Noise (HIN) profile on intelligibility. This particular sensing level is then proposed as additional aid to ASD diagnosis. In this Letter, a novel intelligibility enhancement scheme is also introduced for ASD particular circumstances. For this proposal, harmonic features estimated from speech signal frames are considered as center frequencies of auditory filterbanks. A gain factor is further applied to the output of the filtered samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposal improved the acoustic intelligibility of ASD and Neurotypicals (NT) people considering four acoustic noises at different signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Are Paralinguistic Representations all that is needed for Speech Emotion Recognition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Availability of representations from pre-trained models (PTMs) have facilitated substantial progress in speech emotion recognition (SER). Particularly, representations from PTM trained for paralinguistic speech processing have shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for SER. However, such paralinguistic PTM representations haven't been evaluated for SER in linguistic environments other than English. Also, paralinguistic PTM representations haven't been investigated in benchmarks such as SUPERB, EMO-SUPERB, ML-SUPERB for SER. This makes it difficult to access the efficacy of paralinguistic PTM representations for SER in multiple languages. To fill this gap, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of five SOTA PTM representations. Our results shows that paralinguistic PTM (TRILLsson) representations performs the best and this performance can be attributed to its effectiveness in capturing pitch, tone and other speech characteristics more effectively than other PTM representations.</description>

      <title>AVCap: Leveraging Audio-Visual Features as Text Tokens for Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in representation learning and language models have propelled Automated Captioning (AC) to new heights, enabling the generation of human-level descriptions. Leveraging these advancements, we propose AVCap, an Audio-Visual Captioning framework, a simple yet powerful baseline approach applicable to audio-visual captioning. AVCap utilizes audio-visual features as text tokens, which has many advantages not only in performance but also in the extensibility and scalability of the model. AVCap is designed around three pivotal dimensions: the exploration of optimal audio-visual encoder architectures, the adaptation of pre-trained models according to the characteristics of generated text, and the investigation into the efficacy of modality fusion in captioning. Our method outperforms existing audio-visual captioning methods across all metrics and the code is available on https://github.com/JongSuk1/AVCap</description>
