      <title>Electrochemical removal of antibiotics and multidrug-resistant bacteria using S-functionalized graphene sponge electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we synthesized S functionalized graphene sponge electrode and applied it for electrochemical oxidation of five commonly used antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin, and inactivation of a multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, E. coli. The experiments were performed using real drinking water in a flow through, one pass mode. Highly polar antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole did not adsorb onto the graphene sponge but were completely removed, i.e., more than 95% removal, at low applied current densities, 14.5 A m2. Antibiotics with high affinity for pi pi interactions were completely removed already in the open circuit, and current application led to their further degradation. S doped graphene sponge anode resulted in 4.5 log removal of a multi-drug resistant E. coli at 29 A m2. There was no regrowth of bacteria observed during storage of the electrochemically treated samples, suggesting that the treatment severely impacted the cell viability. Further E. coli removal of 0.7 log was observed after the storage of electrochemically treated samples. The energy consumption of a continuously operated electrochemical system that achieved 4.5 log inactivation of a multidrug resistant E. coli and 87 to 99% removal of antibiotics was 1.1 kWh m3.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>

      <title>Taylor's swimming sheet near a soft boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1951, G.I. Taylor modeled swimming microorganisms by hypothesizing an infinite sheet in 2D moving in a viscous medium due to a wave passing through it. This simple model not only captured the ability of microorganisms to swim due to the wavy motion of a flagella, but further development into the model captured the optimal nature of metachronal waves observed in ciliates. While the additional effects of nearby rigid boundaries and complex environments have been addressed, herein we explore the correction induced by a nearby soft boundary. Our simple model allows us to show that the magnitude of the swimming velocity gets modified near soft boundaries, and reduces for transverse waves while it increases for longitudinal waves. We further delve into the energetics of the process and the deformation of the corresponding soft boundary, highlighting the synchronization of the oscillations induced on the soft boundary with the waves passing through the sheet and the corresponding changes to the power exerted on the fluid.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Tension Dynamics Model of Epithelial Convergent Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergent extension of epithelial tissue is a key motif of animal morphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet in contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the tissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this apparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow in the tension-dominated regime occurs through adiabatic remodeling of force balance in the network of adherens junctions. We propose that the slow dynamics within the manifold of force-balanced configurations is driven by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting force balance within a tension network causes active cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) resulting in net tissue deformation oriented by initial tension anisotropy. Strikingly, we find that the total extent of tissue deformation depends on the initial cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that tissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that coordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations, quantified by a geometric order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces the salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during Drosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after approximately twofold longation concomitant with a loss of order in tension configurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic information and yields experimentally testable predictions. Defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the manifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the description of morphogenetic flow.</description>
