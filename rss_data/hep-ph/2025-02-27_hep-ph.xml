      <title>Towards a Manifestly Causal Approach to Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new, probability-level approach to calculations in scalar field particle scattering. The approach involves the implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. Novel diagrams represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules which generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. The inclusivity and causal structure of this formalism may offer insights into the cancellation of infrared divergences if applied to gauge theory calculations.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Hidden Parton Showers in the Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider confining Hidden Valley/Dark Sector theories containing many dark quark flavors. These theories are in the ``conformal window'': they reach an infrared fixed point when their quarks are massless, and have unfamiliar confinement when the quark masses are non-zero but small. Their jets of hidden hadrons may be quite different from those familiar from QCD, but their details cannot currently be simulated even qualitatively. This is partly due to the use of approximations to the two-loop running coupling in existing event generators' parton showers, which are not broadly applicable across the conformal window. We argue that the exact two-loop running coupling, and a corresponding Sudakov factor employing that coupling, must be implemented in simulation packages in order to allow phenomenological studies of these theories.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading order threshold soft function for $tW$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop soft function for the associated production of a top quark and a $W$ boson near the threshold, where the invariant mass of the $tW$ system approaches the collider energy. We employ the reverse unitarity technique and integration-by-parts identities to reduce soft loop integrals to a minimal basis of master integrals. These master integrals are analytically evaluated using the method of differential equations, yielding results expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the soft function in the low and high energy limits. Our results provide a vital component for threshold resummation at the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level in this process.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approaches to Top Quark Flavor-Changing Four-Fermion Interactions in Trilepton Signals at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the top quark flavor-changing 4-Fermi interactions ($tuee$ and $tcee$) with scalar, vector, and tensor structures using machine learning models to analyze tri-lepton processes at the LHC. The study is performed using $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ processes, where a top quark decays into $u/c+e^{+}+e^{-}$. The analysis incorporates both reducible and irreducible backgrounds while accounting for realistic detector effects. The dominant backgrounds for these trilepton signatures arise from $t\bar{t}$ production, single top quark production in association with $V$, and $VV$ production (where $V = W, Z$). These backgrounds are significantly reduced using machine learning-based classification models, which optimize event selection and improve signal sensitivity. For an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC, we find that the expected $95\%$ confidence level (CL) limits on the scale of 4-Fermi FCNC interactions reach $\Lambda \leq 5.5$ TeV for $tuee$ and $\Lambda \leq 5.7$ TeV for $tcee$ in the $t\bar{t}$ channel, and $\Lambda \leq 1.9$ TeV ($tuee$) and $\Lambda \leq 2.0$ TeV ($tcee$) in the $tW$ channel. We also provide an interpretation of our EFT analysis in the context of a specific $Z'$ model, illustrating how the derived constraints translate into bounds on the parameter space of a heavy neutral gauge boson mediating flavor-changing interactions.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization Kinetic Equation from Open Quantum Systems and Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions have aroused a great interest in understanding dynamical spin evolution of the QCD matter. In particular, the spin alignment signature of $J/\psi$ has been recently observed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC, which may infer nontrivial spin transport of quarkonia in quark gluon plasmas. Motivated by this, we study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. By applying the Markovian approximation and Wigner transformation, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for vector quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. As opposed to the previous study for the spin-independent case where the collision terms depend on chromoelectric correlators, the new kinetic equation incorporates gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields that determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working in the multipole expansion. In the quantum Brownian motion limit, the Lindblad equation with new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators have also been derived. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled quark gluon plasmas. It may be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Neutrino Phenomenology in Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the fact that no Standard Model (SM) particle can account as a suitable dark matter candidate in the relevant studies, several Beyond Standard Model (BSM) frameworks incorporate within itself some extra fields depending upon the model taken into account. Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) is one such BSM framework which can successfully explain the origin of neutrino masses and also give an elaborative elucidation of the associated phenomenology like Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$, Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV), baryogenesis via leptogenesis etc. However, in spite of the presence of several new fields within the model, none of them can stand as a suitable dark matter candidate. This compels us to extend LRSM with extra scalars or fermions depending upon the type of study to be taken into account. In the current work, we extend LRSM with a sterile fermion per generation and the lightest of which acts as the Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The realization of the model has been done using modular symmetry, where we have used modular group $\Gamma(3)$ of weight 2 which is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A_{4}$. We have then calculated the relic abundance as well the decay rate of the corresponding DM candidate and also studied $0\nu\beta\beta$ and LFV within the model and the results have been discussed in detail within the manuscript.</description>

      <title>A hybrid model for multi-particle production and multi-fragment emission in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To present a prediction of the multi-particle production and multi-fragment emission in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a simple hybrid model which is based on the multi-source thermal model and the ideal gas model is proposed in this article. According to the hybrid model, some statistical laws such as the two-component Erlang distribution and others are presented, which means a two-source production. These statistical laws are hopeful to describe the bulk properties of multiple particles produced in the scattering of electron-nucleon ($eN$) and multiple fragments emitted in the fragmentation of excited residual nucleus. Although both the scattering and fragmentation can occur in $eA$ collisions at the EIC, their two-sources are different. In $eN$ scattering, the multiple particles come from the soft excitation and hard scattering processes respectively, which are classified as two different types of events. In nuclear fragmentation, the multiple fragments come from the cold and hot sources which exist in the same excited nucleus.</description>

      <title>Interplay of ALP Couplings at a Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles can couple to Standard Model gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, and massive fermions. A future multi-TeV muon collider provides a favorable environment to probe axion-like particles through multiple production channels, including vector boson fusion via electroweak gauge boson couplings and the top-associated production mediated by direct fermionic couplings. Motivated by the quality issue of the QCD axion, we focus on axion-like particles with masses and decay constants around the TeV scale. We explore how different axion-like particle couplings shape its production and decay modes, revealing a rich and intricate phenomenological landscape.</description>

      <title>Axion Emission from Proton Cooper Pairs in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axion emission from singlet proton Cooper pairs in neutron stars, a process that dominates axion emission in young neutron stars in the KSVZ model. By re-deriving its emissivity, we confirm consistency with most existing literature, except for a recent study that exhibits a different dependence on the effective mass. This discrepancy results in more than an order-of-magnitude deviation in emissivity, significantly impacting constraints on the KSVZ axion from the cooling observations of the Cassiopeia A neutron star. Furthermore, we examine uncertainties arising from neutron-star equations of state and their role in the discrepancy, finding that the large deviation persists regardless of the choice of equations of state.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth's interior with atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Scaling for count-in-cell and factorial moment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of remnants associated with the QCD chiral critical point is a primary objective in high-energy ion collision experiments. Numerous studies indicate that a scaling relation between higher-order factorial moments of hadron multiplicity distributions and the second factorial moment may serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying the QCD critical point. However, we demonstrate that this scaling behavior is not exclusive to critical phenomena but rather arises as a general consequence of the phase-space partitioning procedure employed in the analysis. This finding is examined in the context of recent intermittency analyses conducted by the STAR experiment at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Updating TMD parton densities in a proton within the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical expressions for the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD, or unintegrated) gluon and quark densities in a proton derived at leading order of QCD running coupling and valid at both small and large x. The calculations are performed using the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin/Watt-Martin-Ryskin prescription (in both differential and integral formulations) with different treatment of kinematical constraint, which reflects the angular and strong ordering conditions for parton emissions. As an input, analytical solution of QCD evolution equations for conventional (collinear) parton distributions is applied, where the valence and non-singlet quark parts obey the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith and Gottfried sum rules and momentum conservation for the singlet quark and gluon densities is taken into account. Several phenomenological parameters are extracted from combined fit to precision data on the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ collected by the BCDMS, H1 and ZEUS Collaborations, comprising a total of 933 points from 5 data sets. Comparison with the numerical results obtained by other groups is presented and phenomenological application to the inclusive b-jet production at the LHC is given.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Towards the strong decays of light strange four-quark states with $J^P=1^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis considers the decays of fully light four quark exotic as the main subject. In the context, we study the possible decays from general symmetric analysis: $uu\bar d\bar s$, $dd\bar s\bar u$, $ds\bar u \bar u$, and $su\bar d \bar d$. Using the light quark flavor symmetry, we discuss the decay modes of decuplet and 27 multiplet with $J^P=1^+$. Further more, the phenomenological hadronic molecular approach is employed for the calculation of respective decay modes. Our results show that the total decay widths of $T_{\rho K}$ and $S_{\rho K^*}$ can reach several MeV. The two-body and three-body decay widths are further obtained respectively. These are excepted to be fairly valuable supports for future search experiments.</description>

      <title>Search for oscillating fundamental constants using a paired detector and vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (UDM) may manifest itself through oscillating fundamental constants of normal matter. These can be experimentally searched for by implementing two dissimilar oscillators producing a beat between their frequencies and analyzing the beat-frequency time series for the presence of any temporal oscillations. Typically, the time series of such a detector contains contributions from nonstationary noise. In order to reduce the influence of such noise we propose and demonstrate paired detectors: two nominally identical detectors whose signals are synchronously recorded. The cross-spectrum of the two individual beat time series is then analyzed for UDM signatures. This approach permits us to suppress spurious signals appearing in uncorrelated fashion in either detector. We furthermore demonstrate detectors that are based on a vibrational molecular transition, which are advantageous due to their larger sensitivity to oscillations of the nuclear masses. The analysis of 274 hours of data yielded improved bounds for the coupling constants of UDM to nuclear mass and to electron mass in the frequency ranges 10-500 Hz and 10-122 kHz, with improvement factors between 6 and 10. These bounds are currently the strongest. Similar bounds are obtained for the fine-structure constant. The present approach may be generalized to large ensembles of detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales that is operative after recombination. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field, $\phi$, that is coupled to the electromagnetic field tensor via a $\phi F \wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian of axion-electrodynamics. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$.</description>

      <title>Topological Susceptibility in the Superconductive Phases of Quantum Chromodynamics: a Dyson-Schwinger Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test non-perturbative gluon propagators recently studied in the literature, by computing the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, of the superconductive phases of Quantum Chromodynamics at high density. We formulate the problem within the High-Density Effective Theory, and use the 2-particle irreducible formalism to compute the effective potential of the dense phases. We focus on superconductive phases with two and three massless flavors. Within this formalism, we write a Dyson-Schwinger equation in the rainbow approximation for the anomalous part of the quark propagator in the superconductive phases, in which the non-perturbative gluon propagator plays its role. We complete the model by adding a $U(1)_A$-breaking term whose coupling is fixed perturbatively at large quark chemical potential. We then use the effective potential to compute $\chi$ in the superconductive phases. We finally discuss implications of the results for the axion mass in superdense phases of Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $p ~f_1(1285)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have addressed here the problem of calculating the correlation function of a stable particle with a resonance, in particular one resonance that qualifies as a molecular state of two components. The formalism used requires to evaluate the scattering matrix of the stable particle with the molecule, a nuclear problem which we address by means of the fixed center approximation. We have applied the method to the interaction of a proton with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, presently under investigation by the ALICE collaboration, where the $f_1(1285)$ is taken as a $K^*\bar{K}-\bar{K}^*K$ molecule. We find that the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ interaction develops a resonance state below the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ threshold, which leads to a depletion in the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ correlation function for small values of the proton momentum. The discussion presented shows that these type of studies can provide much information on the nature of some resonances and the existence of three-body bound states involving mesons and baryons.</description>

      <title>Probing a low-mass $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson at IceCube and prospects for IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts a new massive gauge boson, $Z'$, on astrophysical neutrino events at the IceCube Observatory. This new gauge boson couples with leptons from the second and third families, and would break the power law of the astrophysical neutrino flux due to the interaction of this flux with the cosmic neutrino background. We derive the sensitivity of the IceCube to this model considering the HESE data from 12 years of observation by assuming different assumptions for the redshift distributions of astrophysical neutrino sources, mass ordering, and sum of neutrino masses. Our results indicate that the current IceCube data is able to probe small coupling and masses of the order of some few MeV, with the covered parameter space being larger if a distribution of neutrino sources is described by the star formation rate model. In addition, we demonstrate that the IceCube-Gen2 will cover a large region of the parameter space and will allow us to improve our understanding of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft-gluon resolution scales characterize parton branching Monte Carlo implementations of the evolution equations for parton distribution functions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We examine scenarios with dynamical, i.e., branching-scale dependent, resolution scale, and discuss physical implications for both collinear and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) distributions. We perform the first determination of parton distributions with dynamical resolution scale, at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory, from fits to precision deep-inelastic scattering measurements from HERA. We present an application of TMD distributions with dynamical resolution scale to Drell-Yan lepton-pair transverse momentum spectra at the LHC, and comment on the extraction of non-perturbative intrinsic-kT parameters from Drell-Yan data at small transverse momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of this uncertainty using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction.</description>

Abstract: In this work we show the quaternionic quantum descriptions of physical processes from the Planck to macro scale. The results presented here are based on the concepts of the Cauchy continuum and the elementary cell at the Planck scale. The symmetrization of quaternion relations and the postulate of quaternion velocity have been crucial in the present development. The momentum of the expansion and compression is the consequence of the scalar term in the quaternionic deformation potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector may produce all or part of the low-frequency gravitational wave signal recently reported by the NANOGrav Collaboration and other pulsar timing arrays. Here we point out, with a simple toy model, that even if the amplitude of the gravitational wave background from the dark phase transition is insufficient to match the NANOGrav signal, a modified expansion rate at early times may considerably enhance the gravitational wave signal. In particular, a faster-than-standard expansion rate, triggered, for instance, by the presence of one or more additional sources of energy density redshifting with higher powers of temperatures than radiation, boosts upper limits on the gravitational wave signal from first-order cosmological phase transitions, enlarging the slate of possible dark sector scenarios matching the NANOGrav signal.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes: Energies, Correlations, and Superfluid Pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform \textit{ab initio} nuclear lattice calculations of the neutron-rich carbon and oxygen isotopes using high-fidelity chiral interactions. We find good agreement with the observed binding energies and compute correlations associated with each two-nucleon interaction channel. For the isospin $T=1$ channels, we show that the dependence on $T_z$ provides a measure of the correlations among the extra neutrons in the neutron-rich nuclei. For the spin-singlet S-wave channel, we observe that any paired neutron interacts with the nuclear core as well as its neutron pair partner, while any unpaired neutron interacts primarily with only the nuclear core. For the other partial waves, the correlations among the extra neutrons grow more slowly and smoothly with the number of neutrons. These general patterns are observed in both the carbon and oxygen isotopes and may be universal features that appear in many neutron-rich nuclei.</description>

      <title>Implications of {\sigma}-cut potential on Antikaon condensates in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. The well-known RMF models, TM1 and TM1e, are used to analyze the structure and composition of neutron stars. The antikaon condensation part of the equation of state (EoS) is constrained from the experimental data of K$^{-}$ atomic and kaon-nucleon scattering. The $\sigma$-cut potential, which is known to make the EoS stiffer at high densities, is modulated by a free parameter $f_{s}$. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikaon condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The antikaon phase transition is a second-order for $f_{s}$ = 0.6 for both TM1 and TM1e parameter sets. The calculated global properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensates i.e., mass and radius seem to be in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.</description>

Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking within the AdS/QCD framework using the D3/D7-brane model. By analyzing the brane embeddings, we obtain three types of massless solutions, corresponding to three phases with different behavior in the dual field theory. From the study of quark condensates, free energy, and electric currents, we find that helical magnetic fields can counteract uniform-field-induced symmetry breaking, driving the system towards symmetry restoration. We also find an effect analog to the chiral magnetic effect whereby the current is parallel to the magnetic field. We further study the massive case, and find that the helical configuration is less effective in erasing the first order phase transition that is present in the case of a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Light dilaton near critical points in top-down holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of UV-complete, strongly coupled, confining three-dimensional field theories, that exhibit a novel stabilisation mechanism for the mass of the lightest scalar composite state, relying on the existence of a critical point. The theories admit a holographic dual description in terms of regular backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Their phase diagram includes a line of first-order phase transitions ending at the critical point, where the transition becomes of second order. We calculate the mass spectrum of bound states of the field theory, by considering fluctuations around the background solutions, and find that, near the critical point, a hierarchy of scales develops, such that one state becomes parametrically light. We identify this state as the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This stabilisation mechanism might be exploited to address hierarchy problems in particle and astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Structure of Loop Amplitudes and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-similar structure of loop amplitudes in quantum field theory and apply it to amplitude generation and renormalization. A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is best described as a coupling in the effective action. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a constant coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This approach also provides an alternative bottom-up method to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the forward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

      <title>Z and Higgs boson decays with doubly-charged scalars at one-loop: current constraints, future sensitivities, and application to lepton-triality models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the $Z$ and Higgs boson decays $Z\to \ell^+ \ell^- $ ($\ell = e, \mu,\tau$), $H\to \gamma\gamma$ and $H\to Z\gamma$ that are induced at one-loop level in models with a doubly-charged isosinglet scalar. After discussing current constraints, we derive the parameter space that will be probed by the HL-LHC and the possible future colliders the ILC, CEPC and FCC. We then apply those constraints to lepton triality models which are based on a discrete $Z_3$ family symmetry and were recently studied in the context of charged-lepton flavour-violating processes at Belle II and the proposed $\mu^+ \mu^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. We find that the future constraints that can be imposed by $Z \to \ell^+ \ell^-$ on the lepton flavour conserving couplings of the triality models reduce the viable parameter space to probe lepton flavour violating processes. The constraints from Higgs boson decays are the first on the Higgs portal sector of the triality models.</description>

      <title>SUBA-Jet: a new Model for Jets in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model for jet quenching in a quark gluon plasma (QGP). The jet energy loss has two steps. The initial jet parton with a high virtuality loses energy by a perturbative vacuum parton shower modified by medium interactions until it becomes on shell. Subsequent energy loss originates from elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency of the radiative collisions is achieved by starting with virtual gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is obtained by increasing the phase of the virtual gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. Above a phase threshold, the virtual gluons will be formed and can produce coherent radiation themselves. The model has been implemented in a Monte Carlo code and is validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z prediction for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium. Results for the more realistic case, in which the assumptions of the BDMPS-Z approach are released, are also shown. We investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy spectrum and the transverse momentum distribution, such as the in-medium quark masses, the energy transfer in the recoil process, and the phase accumulation criteria, especially for low and intermediate energy gluons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and gravitational waves in maximally symmetric composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study phase transitions in a maximally symmetric composite Higgs model with next-to-minimal coset, where a pseudoscalar singlet emerges alongside the Higgs doublet. The maximal symmetry guarantees the finiteness of the radiatively generated scalar potential. We explore the scenario involving an explicit source of CP violation in the strong sector, which induces a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ asymmetric scalar potential, and consequently leads to nonzero vacuum expectation value for the singlet. Current experimental bounds from the LHC are imposed on the masses of the composite resonances, while the CP violating interactions of the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons are tightly constrained from the measurements of the electric dipole moment of the electron. We compute the finite temperature corrections to the potential, incorporating the momentum-dependent form factors in the loop integrals to capture the effect of the strong dynamics. The impact of the resonances from the strong sector on the finite temperature potential are exponentially suppressed. The presence of explicit CP violation leads to strong first-order phase transition from a false vacuum to the electroweak vacuum where the pseudoscalar singlet has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. We illustrate that, as a result of such phase transitions, the production of potentially observable gravitational waves at future detectors will offer a complementary avenue to probe the composite Higgs models, distinct from collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the usual scalar potential of the Minimal Supersymmetric $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L}\times U(1)_{N}$ Model. In this article, we will consider the case in wich all the usual neutral scalars fields of this model obtain vacuum expectation values. When we allow in our superpotential, only interactions that respect the invariance of the quantum number, ${\cal F}$. We obtain, as in the minimal $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L}\times U(1)_{N}$ model without supersymmetry, a Majoron. However, by allowing the violation of this quantum number, we can remove the Majoron in a mechanism similar to that recently presented in the Supersymmetric version of the scheme of Gelmini-Roncadelli. The mass spectrum obtained is in agreement with current experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed a model for spontaneous CP symmetry breaking in five-dimensional space-time that has a potential to solve the strong CP problem. To explain the nature of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe, three right-handed neutrinos and $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interaction are introduced in the bulk, in addition to the field contents of the Bento-Branco-Parada model. The wave-function profiles in the fifth dimension can suppress dangerous operators allowed by symmetries, and the scale of spontaneous CP symmetry breaking can be sufficiently large to be consistent with thermal leptogenesis. In this model, the lightest right-handed neutrino serves as dark matter with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ keV. This small mass and the necessarily small mixing are explained by the exponentially localized wave-function in the fifth dimension due to a bulk mass term. The correct relic abundance is achieved thanks to the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interaction. The other heavy right-handed neutrinos explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis, with the required CP violating phases generated by interactions involving heavy leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a novel real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) for dynamical systems with reversible mode couplings to study Model H, the conjectured dynamic universality class of the QCD critical point. We emphasize the structural similarities with Model G, conjectured to be the dynamic universality class of the chiral phase transition in the limit of two massless quark flavors. Importantly, our formulation of the real-time FRG preserves all relevant symmetries throughout the FRG flow which, e.g., guarantees the non-renormalization of the reversible mode couplings, as but one exact result. We derive non-perturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, Model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak-scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H.</description>

      <title>Testing leptogenesis and dark matter production during reheating with primordial gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of baryon asymmetry as well as dark matter (DM) in an extended reheating period after the end of slow-roll inflation. Within the regime of perturbative reheating, we consider different monomial potential of the inflaton field during reheating era. The inflaton condensate reheats the Universe by decaying into the Standard Model (SM) bath either via fermionic or bosonic decay modes. Assuming the leptogenesis route to baryogenesis in a canonical seesaw framework, we consider both the radiation bath and perturbative inflaton decay to produce such RHNs during the period of reheating when the maximum temperature of the SM bath is well above the reheating temperature. The DM, assumed to be a SM gauge singlet field, also gets produced from the bath during the reheating period via UV freeze-in. In addition to obtaining different parameter space for such non-thermal leptogenesis and DM for both bosonic and fermionic reheating modes and the type of monomial potential, we discuss the possibility of probing such scenarios via spectral shape of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of the quark propagator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE. The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quark-gluon vertex.</description>

      <title>The role of $4S$-$3D$ mixing in explaining the $\omega$-like $Y(2119)$ observed in $e^+e^-\to\rho\pi$ and $\rho(1450)\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration has recently reported a new resonance structure in the cross-section analyses of the $e^+e^- \to \rho\pi$ and $e^+e^- \to \rho(1450)\pi$ processes, displaying characteristics akin to an $\omega$-meson. However, its measured mass, $M = 2119 \pm 11 \pm 15 \, \text{MeV}$, significantly deviates from the predictions of the unquenched relativized potential model for conventional $\omega$ vector meson spectroscopy. To address this discrepancy, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme and investigate the corresponding decay properties within this framework. Our analysis demonstrates that the mixed state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ exhibits excellent agreement with the observed resonance, not only in mass and width but also in the products of its dielectron width and branching ratios, $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho(1450)\pi\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0}$. The determined mixing angle, $\theta = -\left(31.1^{+2.1}_{-3.1}\right)\degree$, strongly supports the interpretation of this structure as the $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ state. Furthermore, we predict dominant decay channels for $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ and its partner state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^{\prime\prime}$. These predictions, together with the proposed mixing mechanism, provide crucial guidance for future experimental studies aimed at probing this structure and rigorously testing the $4S$-$3D$ mixing hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrinos: seesaw models and signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to right-handed neutrinos as a simple extension to the Standard Model (SM), focussing on seesaw models and their possible experimental signatures. We preface this with a review of the lepton sector of the SM, where charged lepton masses arise from Yukawa couplings and neutrino Majorana masses from the Weinberg operator, leading to a unitary lepton mixing matrix. We first introduce a single right-handed neutrino and the seesaw mechanism, yielding a heavy neutral lepton, then generalise the results to the canonical case of three right-handed neutrinos within a general parameterisation, leading to non-unitary lepton mixing and three heavy neutral leptons, which can detected directly or indirectly via lepton flavour violation or neutrinoless double beta decay. We show how the sequential dominance of three right-handed neutrinos with diagonal masses naturally leads to an effective two right-handed neutrino model with lepton mixing angle predictions in the constrained cases, but unobservable heavy neutral leptons. On the other hand, with degenerate off-diagonal masses, the two right-handed neutrinos can form a single heavy and observable Dirac neutrino, within a two Higgs doublet or Majoron model. Finally we discuss extra singlet neutrinos which can lead to either a double seesaw or an inverse seesaw, depending on their Majorana masses, where the latter allows observable heavy neutral leptons, and the possibility of a minimal inverse seesaw model where mixing angles can be predicted.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dark Substructure: The Consequences of Atomic Dark Matter on Milky Way Analog Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we explore the properties of subhalos in Milky Way analogs that contain a sub-component of Atomic Dark Matter (ADM). ADM differs from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) due to the presence of self interactions that lead to energy dissipation and bound-state formation, analogous to Standard Model baryons. This model can arise in complex dark sectors that are natural and theoretically-motivated extensions to the Standard Model. The simulations used in this work were carried out using GIZMO and utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics in the Standard Model baryonic sector. For the parameter points we consider, the ADM gas cools efficiently, allowing it to collapse to the center of subhalos. This increases a subhalo's central density and affects its orbit, with more subhalos surviving small pericentric passages. The subset of subhalos that host visible satellite galaxies have cuspier density profiles and smaller stellar-half-mass radii relative to CDM. The entire population of dwarf galaxies produced in the ADM simulations is much more compact than those seen in CDM simulations, unable to reproduce the entire diversity of observed dwarf galaxy structures. Additionally, we also identify a population of highly compact subhalos that consist nearly entirely of ADM and form in the central region of the host, where they can leave distinctive imprints in the baryonic disk. This work presents the first detailed exploration of subhalo properties in a strongly dissipative dark matter scenario, providing intuition for how other regions of ADM parameter space, as well as other dark sector models, would impact galactic-scale observables.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses. While the dependence of the collapse time on mass and concentration implies such behaviour, our semi-analytical approach allows us to quantify and illustrate this trend clearly across the full mass spectrum of subhalos, including for subhalo masses below the resolution limit of any current cosmological SIDM simulation. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-si.</description>

      <title>JUNO Sensitivity to Invisible Decay Modes of Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the decay of bound neutrons into invisible particles (e.g., $n\rightarrow 3 \nu$ or $nn \rightarrow 2 \nu$) in the JUNO liquid scintillator detector, which do not produce an observable signal. The invisible decay includes two decay modes: $ n \rightarrow { inv} $ and $ nn \rightarrow { inv} $. The invisible decays of $s$-shell neutrons in $^{12}{\rm C}$ will leave a highly excited residual nucleus. Subsequently, some de-excitation modes of the excited residual nuclei can produce a time- and space-correlated triple coincidence signal in the JUNO detector. Based on a full Monte Carlo simulation informed with the latest available data, we estimate all backgrounds, including inverse beta decay events of the reactor antineutrino $\bar{\nu}_e$, natural radioactivity, cosmogenic isotopes and neutral current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. Pulse shape discrimination and multivariate analysis techniques are employed to further suppress backgrounds. With two years of exposure, JUNO is expected to give an order of magnitude improvement compared to the current best limits. After 10 years of data taking, the JUNO expected sensitivities at a 90% confidence level are $\tau/B( n \rightarrow { inv} ) &gt; 5.0 \times 10^{31} \, {\rm yr}$ and $\tau/B( nn \rightarrow { inv} ) &gt; 1.4 \times 10^{32} \, {\rm yr}$.</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI 2024 BAO: late-time dynamical dark energy or a local effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Mergers as Probes of Dark Matter in Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, has become a powerful tool impacting various areas of physics. In this proceeding, we investigate the presence of quantum entanglement within the Higgs to ZZ* (HZZ*) interaction at the ATLAS experiment. Utilizing quantum tomography techniques, we extract the complete spin density matrix characterizing the HZZ* interaction from ATLAS Standard Monte Carlo (MC) HZZ* 4l Run2 samples. We then evaluate the presence of quantum entanglement in the system using the derived spin density matrix. Our investigation sheds light on the entanglement properties within the HZZ* interaction, which offers valuable insights into its quantum characteristics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring neutrino mass with 21-cm forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to constrain neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Kaon Modification in Pion Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kaon properties in thermal pion-nucleon medium are studied. The dense pion-nucleon medium is produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The consideration is based on the chiral nucleon-kaon-pion Lagrangian. It is found that the pion medium does not produce a substantive contribution but enhances the effect of the baryon matter. Numerical estimate shows that this enhancement factor induced by the pion medium does not exceed 5% at the freeze-out stage of heavy-ion collisions, i.e. it is small. However, the impact of this enhancement can be higher in actual nuclear collisions because the effect of the in-medium (anti)kaon modification is accumulated during the (anti)kaon evolution before the freeze-out when the pion density is higher.</description>

Abstract: We present an alternative procedure for defining infra-red counterterms within dimensional regularisation for use in the $R^*$ procedure. The counterterms are given by simple closed expressions, and lead to the standard MSbar UV counterterms.</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>
