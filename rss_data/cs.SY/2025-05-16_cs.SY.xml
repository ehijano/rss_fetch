      <title>Risk-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning for Control of Stochastic Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Measuring Flexibility through Reduction Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While electric vehicles (EVs) often exhibit substantial flexibility, harnessing this flexibility requires precise characterization of its timing and magnitude. This paper introduces the reduction potential matrix, a novel approach to EV load flexibility modeling which is both straightforward to calculate and intuitive to interpret. This paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying flexibility for two distinct commercial vehicle groups--freight vehicles and transit buses--using simulated charging data from Virginia. While both groups are found to have substantial flexibility, its properties vary across the groups. Naturally, this variability manifests in differences in each group's role as a grid resource. The paper concludes with a discussion on how system planners, fleet operators, and other stakeholders can use the matrix to assess and leverage EV flexibility.</description>

      <title>The Path Integral Bottleneck: Exploring the Control-Compute Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executing a control sequence requires some computation effort. Intuitively, a high-effort, fine-grained computation should result in better control (e.g. lower cost), whereas little to no computation effort would lead to worse control. To quantify and explore the tradeoff between control performance and compute effort, we present the Path Integral Bottleneck (PIB), a fusion of the Path Integral (PI) optimal control and Information Bottleneck (IB) frameworks. Both frameworks provide flexible and probabilistic descriptions of control. The PI does not limit itself to a particular control law, and the IB is not bound to any specific state encoding. Combining the generality of both frameworks enables us to produce an analytical description of the control-compute tradeoff. We provide PIB formulations for both continuous and discrete random variables. With these formulations, we can plot a tradeoff curve between performance and computation effort for any given plant description and control cost function. Simulations of a cart-pole for both the continuous and discrete variable cases reveal fundamental control-compute tradeoffs, exposing regions where the task performance-per-compute is higher than others.</description>

      <title>Stability and Convergence Analysis of Multi-Agent Consensus with Communication Delays: A Lambert W Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of constant time delay in weakly connected multi-agent systems modeled by double integrator dynamics. A novel analytical approach is proposed to establish an upper bound on the permissible time delay that ensures stability and consensus convergence. The analysis employs the Lambert W function method in higher-dimensional systems to derive explicit conditions under which consensus is achieved. The theoretical results are rigorously proven and provide insight into the allowable delay margins. The analysis applies to general leaderless undirected network topologies. The framework also accounts for complex and realistic delays, including non-commensurate communication delays. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Synergistic Controllers with Dwell-Time Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel event-triggered synergistic controllers for nonlinear continuous-time plants by incorporating event-triggered control into stabilizing synergistic controllers. We highlight that a naive application of common event-triggering conditions may not ensure dwell-time transmission due to the joint jumping dynamics of the closed-loop system. Under mild conditions, we develop a suite of event-triggered synergistic controllers that guarantee both dwell-time transmission and global asymptotic stability. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller applied to the problem of rigid body attitude stabilization.</description>

      <title>Provably safe and human-like car-following behaviors: Part 1. Analysis of phases and dynamics in standard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is essential for ensuring safe driving in the face of uncertainties related to communication, sensing, and dynamic factors such as weather, road conditions, policies, and other road users. Existing car-following models often lack rigorous safety proofs and the ability to replicate human-like driving behaviors consistently. This article applies multi-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to highlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin by formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following behaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam spacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order principles for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking profiles. From a set of these zeroth- and first-order principles, we derive Newell's simplified car-following model. Subsequently, we analyze phases within the speed-spacing plane for the stationary lead-vehicle problem in Newell's model and its extensions, which incorporate both bounded acceleration and deceleration. We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model and the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of these models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles. Numerical simulations and empirical observations validate the theoretical insights. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further integrate safety, human-like behaviors, and vehicular automation in car-following models, which are addressed in Part 2 of this study \citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part2}, where we develop a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model that addresses the limitations identified here.</description>

      <title>Provably safe and human-like car-following behaviors: Part 2. A parsimonious multi-phase model with projected braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and human-like trajectory planning for automated vehicles amidst real-world uncertainties remains a critical challenge. While existing car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study \citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary lead-vehicle problem. Finally, we discuss the model's implications and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Threshold Strategy for Leaking Corner-Free Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability with Decomposed Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability is widely used to compute value functions for states satisfying specific control objectives. However, it becomes intractable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction approaches are essential for mitigating this challenge, whereas they could introduce the ``leaking corner issue", leading to inaccuracies in the results. In this paper, we define the ``leaking corner issue" in terms of value functions, propose and prove a necessary condition for its occurrence. We then use these theoretical contributions to introduce a new local updating method that efficiently corrects inaccurate value functions while maintaining the computational efficiency of the dimensionality reduction approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations. Although we validate our method with the self-contained subsystem decomposition (SCSD), our approach is applicable to other dimensionality reduction techniques that introduce the ``leaking corners".</description>

      <title>Planar Herding of Multiple Evaders with a Single Herder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar herding problem is considered, where a superior pursuer herds a flock of non-cooperative, inferior evaders around a predefined target point. An inverse square law of repulsion is assumed between the pursuer and each evader. Two classes of pursuer trajectories are proposed: (i) a constant angular-velocity spiral, and (ii) a constant angular-velocity circle, both centered around the target point. For the spiraling pursuer, the radial velocity is dynamically adjusted based on a feedback law that depends on the instantaneous position of the evader, which is located at the farthest distance from the target at the start of the game. It is shown that, under suitable choices of the model parameters, all the evaders are herded into an arbitrarily small limit cycle around the target point. Meanwhile, the pursuer also converges onto a circular trajectory around the target. The conditions for the stability of these limit cycles are derived. For the circling pursuer, similar guarantees are provided along with explicit formulas for the radii of the limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Systems Controllability via Edge Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the controllability of power networks is crucial as they are highly complex networks operating in synchrony; even minor perturbations can cause desynchronization and instability. To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multi-machine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.</description>

      <title>DB InfraGO's Automated Dispatching Assistant ADA-PMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As railway infrastructure manager, DB InfraGO AG is faced with the challenge of offering fluid and punctual operation despite rising demand and increased construction activity. The high capacity utilisation, especially in the core network sections, causes delays to be propagated quickly and widely across the entire network. Up to now, conflicts between train runs can be identified automatically, but dispatching measures have been based on past human experience.
  An automated dispatching assistance system is currently being piloted to provide support for train dispatchers in their work. The aim is to offer them helpful dispatching recommendations, particularly in stressful situations with a high conflict density in the network section under consideration, in order to ensure the most efficient operation of the system.
  The recommendations are currently displayed separately alongside the central control system. In future, they will be integrated into the central control system, which will significantly simplify communication between the train dispatcher and signal setter. Further development steps for the integration process are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Strategy for Aggregated Probabilistic Forecasting and Energy Trading in HEFTCom2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy systems. This paper presents the solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024). The solution provides accurate probabilistic forecasts for a wind-solar hybrid system, and achieves substantial trading revenue in the day-ahead electricity market. Key components include: (1) a stacking-based approach combining sister forecasts from various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) to provide wind power forecasts, (2) an online solar post-processing model to address the distribution shift in the online test set caused by increased solar capacity, (3) a probabilistic aggregation method for accurate quantile forecasts of hybrid generation, and (4) a stochastic trading strategy to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices. This paper also explores the potential of end-to-end learning to further enhance the trading revenue by adjusting the distribution of forecast errors. Detailed case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. Code for all mentioned methods is available for reproduction and further research in both industry and academia.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Innate Computing Abilities in Electric Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy consumption of artificial intelligence has gained momentum worldwide, which necessitates major investments on expanding efficient and carbon-neutral generation and data center infrastructure in electric power grids. Going beyond the conventional ideation, this article unleashes innate computational abilities in the power grid network circuits itself. By programming power electronic converters (PECs) to mimic biological neurons, we sustainably transform power grids into a neural network and enable it to optimize, compute and make data-driven decisions using distributed PECs. Instead of seen merely as an energy delivery platform, this article conceptualizes a novel application for electric grid to be used as a computing asset without affecting its operation. To illustrate its computational abilities, we solve a affine transformation task in a microgrid with five PECs. By encoding the digital data into the control of PECs, our preliminary results conclude that computing using electric grids does not disturb its operation. From a scientific perspective, this work fundamentally merges energy and computing optimization theories by harnessing inherent high-dimensional computational relationships in electric grids.</description>

      <title>Can On Body Sensing Be Spatial Adaptive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable sensors are typically affixed to specific locations on the human body, and their position remains static, only changing unintentionally due to motion artifacts. This static configuration introduces significant limitations. As a result, current systems miss the opportunity to capture dynamic physiological data from diverse body regions. This research investigates the potential of developing movable sensors that adaptively reposition themselves to sample different areas of interest on the body, addressing gaps in spatial coverage. We designed, developed, and fabricated a 3 x 3 matrix platform to support moving sensors from one location to another. We validated the feasibility through simulations on a matrix of up to 9 x 9 locations with up to 16 concurrent sensors and real-world prototype characterization.</description>

      <title>On Signed Network Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.</description>

      <title>Visual Feedback of Pattern Separability Improves Myoelectric Decoding Performance of Upper Limb Prostheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.</description>

      <title>Hamilton's Rule for Enabling Altruism in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Hamilton's rule to altruistic decision-making in multi-agent systems. Inspired by biological altruism, we introduce a framework that evaluates when individual agents should incur costs to benefit their neighbors. By adapting Hamilton's rule, we define agent ``fitness" in terms of task productivity rather than genetic survival. We formalize altruistic decision-making through a graph-based model of multi-agent interactions and propose a solution using collaborative control Lyapunov functions. The approach ensures that altruistic behaviors contribute to the collective goal-reaching efficiency of the system. We illustrate this framework on a multi-agent way-point navigation problem, where we show through simulation how agent importance levels influence altruistic decision-making, leading to improved coordination in navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>

      <title>Hyper Yoshimura: How a slight tweak on a classical folding pattern unleashes meta-stability for deployable robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployable structures inspired by origami offer lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable solutions for robotic and architectural applications. We present a geometric and mechanical framework for Yoshimura-Ori modules that supports a diverse set of metastable states, including newly identified asymmetric "pop-out" and "hyperfolded" configurations. These states are governed by three parameters -- tilt angle, phase shift, and slant height -- and enable discrete, programmable transformations. Using this model, we develop forward and inverse kinematic strategies to stack modules into deployable booms that approximate complex 3D shapes. We validate our approach through mechanical tests and demonstrate a tendon- and pneumatically-actuated Yoshimura Space Crane capable of object manipulation, solar tracking, and high load-bearing performance. A meter-scale solar charging station further illustrates the design's scalability. These results establish Yoshimura-Ori structures as a promising platform for adaptable, multifunctional deployable systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a study on using different offline reinforcement learning algorithms for microgrid voltage regulation with solar power penetration. When environment interaction is unviable due to technical or safety reasons, the proposed approach can still obtain an applicable model through offline-style training on a previously collected dataset, lowering the negative impact of lacking online environment interactions. Experiment results on the IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach on different offline datasets, including the one with merely low-quality experience.</description>

      <title>Fast Heuristic Scheduling and Trajectory Planning for Robotic Fruit Harvesters with Multiple Cartesian Arms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a fast heuristic algorithm for the coupled scheduling and trajectory planning of multiple Cartesian robotic arms harvesting fruits. Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</description>

      <title>Angle diversity receiver as a key enabler for reliable ORIS-based Visible Light Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a promising solution to satisfy the increasing demand for wireless data. However, link blockages remain a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement ORIS-assisted VLC.</description>

      <title>Self Clocked Digital LDO for Cryogenic Power Management in 22nm FDSOI with 98 Percent Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer~(QC), though promising ground breaking solutions to complex problems, still faces several challenges with respect to scalability. Current state-of-the-art QC use a great quantity of cables to connect the physical qubits, situated in the cryogenic temperature, to room temperature electronics. Integrated cryogenic electronics together with semiconductor spin qubits is one way closer for scalability. Such a scalable quantum computer can have qubits and the control electronics at 4K stage. Being at 4K, more thermal dissipation is allowed without overloading the cooling capability of the fridge. Still, control and power circuitry is expected to be highly efficient. While commercial CMOS technologies are found to be operatable at \qty{}{mK}, lack of reliable cryogenic models while designing, increased mismatches at cryo temperatures makes the design challenging and risky. Using an FDSOI technology with backgate biasing to compensate for the threshold voltage drift happening at cryo~(compensating around 200mV) and digital circuitry is a way to address this challenge. In this work, a self-clocked digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) is designed in FDSOI for high power efficient, variation tolerant regulator to supply cryogenic circuits for Quantum computing. The proposed digital LDO is more resilient to mismatch and having self clocking and close and fine loops addresses the power efficiency and faster transient response.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing demand for ultra-precise time synchronization and frequency dissemination across various scientific, industrial, and communication fields, the Czech Republic has developed an innovative, non-commercial fiber-based infrastructure. This infrastructure serves as a shared platform, utilizing optical fibers to enable high-precision timing, coherent frequency transfer, and a newly implemented vibrational sensing capability. The project also addresses challenges posed by classical communication noise-particularly from Raman scattering-on quantum channels, especially for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). By strategically separating classical and quantum channels into distinct wavelength bands, such as the C-band and O-band, the infrastructure achieves minimal interference while enabling multiple concurrent applications over shared fiber lines.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of SMT and MILP for the Nurse Rostering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However, the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades, with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of personnel scheduling.</description>

      <title>pc-dbCBS: Kinodynamic Motion Planning of Physically-Coupled Robot Teams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning problems for physically-coupled multi-robot systems in cluttered environments are challenging due to their high dimensionality. Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25 simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods, pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process, resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment. Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.</description>

      <title>AutoCam: Hierarchical Path Planning for an Autonomous Auxiliary Camera in Surgical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</description>

      <title>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02792v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system operators and electric utility companies often impose a coincident peak demand charge on customers when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum. This charge incentivizes customers to strategically shift their peak usage away from the system's collective peak, which helps reduce stress on electricity infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze how such strategic behavior affects overall system efficiency. We show that depending on the extent of customers' demand-shifting capabilities, the resulting coincident peak shaving game can exhibit concavity, quasi-concavity with discontinuities, or non-concavity with discontinuities. In a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and generalize our findings to multi-agent contexts. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and propose an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes under all game configurations. Our results indicate that the peak-shaving outcome at the equilibrium of the game model is comparable to the optimal outcome of the natural centralized model. However, there is a significant loss in efficiency. Under quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, this inefficiency grows with increased customer flexibility and larger disparities in marginal shifting costs; we also examine how the number of agents influences system performance. Finally, numerical simulations with real-world applications validate our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Predictive Position Estimation for Remote Surgery under Packet Loss Using the Informer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time position estimation of the robotic arm on the patient's side is crucial for the success of remote robotic surgery in Tactile Internet environments. This paper proposes a predictive approach using the computationally efficient Transformer-based Informer model for position estimation, combined with a Four-State Hidden Markov Model (4-State HMM) to simulate realistic packet loss scenarios. The method effectively addresses network-induced delays, jitter, and packet loss, ensuring reliable performance in remote robotic surgery. The study evaluates the Informer model on the JIGSAWS dataset, demonstrating its capability to handle sequential data challenges caused by network uncertainties. Key features, including ProbSparse attention and a generative-style decoder, enhance prediction accuracy, computational speed, and memory efficiency. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves over 90 percent accuracy across varying network conditions. Furthermore, the Informer framework outperforms traditional models such as TCN, RNN, and LSTM, highlighting its suitability for real-time remote surgery applications.</description>

      <title>Certifying Lyapunov Stability of Black-Box Nonlinear Systems via Counterexample Guided Synthesis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications.
  Our work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.
  Our numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.</description>

      <title>On Sampling Time and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invariant sets define regions of the state space where system constraints are always satisfied. The majority of numerical techniques for computing invariant sets have been developed for discrete-time systems with a fixed sampling time. Understanding how invariant sets change with sampling time is critical for designing adaptive-sampling control schemes that ensure constraint satisfaction. We introduce M-step hold control invariance, a generalization of traditional control invariance, and show its practical use to assess the link between control sampling frequency and constraint satisfaction. We robustify M-step hold control invariance against model mismatches and discretization errors, paving the way for adaptive-sampling control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the rising integration of renewable energy sources and the need for more adaptive control strategies. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to power network control (PNC), offering the potential to enhance decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have played a key role in accelerating research by providing standardized benchmarks and problem formulations, leading to rapid advancements in RL-based methods. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of RL applications for power grid topology optimization, categorizing existing techniques, highlighting key design choices, and identifying gaps in current research. Additionally, we present a comparative numerical study evaluating the impact of commonly applied RL-based methods, offering insights into their practical effectiveness. By consolidating existing research and outlining open challenges, this survey aims to provide a foundation for future advancements in RL-driven power grid optimization.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm for Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators have demonstrated promise in modeling and controlling systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Beyond PDEs, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) play a critical role in modeling systems influenced by randomness, with applications in finance, physics, and beyond. However, controlling SPDE-governed systems remains a significant challenge. On the one hand, the regularity of the system's state (which can be intuitively understood as smoothness) deteriorates, making modeling and generalization more challenging. On the other hand, this stochasticity also renders control more unstable and thus less accurate. To address this gap, we propose the Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm (MB-CC), the first model-based closed-loop control method for SPDEs. MB-CC introduces two key innovations to enhance control robustness and efficiency: a Regularity Feature (RF) block and a closed-loop strategy with an operator-encoded policy network. The RF block, inspired by the regularity structure theory of SPDEs, addresses noise-induced irregularities by transforming the network's input, including the system state and noise-perturbed external forces, into a refined feature space for improved forward prediction. Compared to previous works using regularity features, we introduce a new parameterization, data augmentation, and extend the RF block as a plug-and-play component. Additionally, to achieve closed-loop control, we introduce an operator-encoded policy network to map the current state to optimal control, which integrates physical priors and swiftly makes decisions based on states returned by the environment. We conduct a systematic evaluation of MB-CC on two notable SPDEs, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency. The ablation studies show its ability to handle stochasticity more effectively.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-assisted Model Predictive Control Optimization for Power System Real-Time Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Flock Navigation with Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance in Unknown Obstructed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends our prior work on the distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for navigating a robot fleet following a certain flocking behavior in unknown obstructed environments with a more realistic local obstacle avoidance strategy. More specifically, we integrate the local obstacle avoidance constraint using point clouds into the NMPC framework. Here, each agent relies on data from its local sensor to perceive and respond to nearby obstacles. A point cloud processing technique is presented for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional point clouds to minimize the computational burden during the optimization. The process consists of directional filtering and down-sampling that significantly reduce the number of data points. The algorithm's performance is validated through realistic 3D simulations in Gazebo, and its practical feasibility is further explored via hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on embedded platforms.</description>
