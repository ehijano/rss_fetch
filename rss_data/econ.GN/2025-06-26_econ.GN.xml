      <title>Rational Miner Behaviour, Protocol Stability, and Time Preference: An Austrian and Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bitcoin's Incentive Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates Austrian capital theory with repeated game theory to examine strategic miner behaviour under different institutional conditions in blockchain systems. It shows that when protocol rules are mutable, effective time preference rises, undermining rational long-term planning and cooperative equilibria. Using formal game-theoretic analysis and Austrian economic principles, the paper demonstrates how mutable protocols shift miner incentives from productive investment to political rent-seeking and influence games. The original Bitcoin protocol is interpreted as an institutional anchor: a fixed rule-set enabling calculability and low time preference. Drawing on the work of Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek, the argument is made that protocol immutability is essential for restoring strategic coherence, entrepreneurial confidence, and sustainable network equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Institutional Noise, Strategic Deviation, and Intertemporal Collapse: A Formal Model of Miner Behaviour under Protocol Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement. Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.</description>

      <title>Suspense and Surprise in European Football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose utilizing match-level suspense and surprise - which capture the entertainment utility created by competitive balance and outcome uncertainty for sports spectators - as alternative policy targets for league organizers and managers. Through simulations, we derive a benchmark range for suspense and surprise based on a perfectly balanced match before analyzing over 25,000 men's matches (2010/11-2023/24) and 725 women's matches (2023/24) from Europe's top football leagues. Our findings reveal that an average match generates lower suspense compared to the benchmark range, particularly for top teams, while surprise values consistently align with the benchmark. Moreover, we observe nuanced trends over time in men's football and highlight notable differences across leagues and clubs in both men's and women's competitions. These insights enhance our understanding of how the attractiveness of matches arises from competitive balance and carry important policy implications.</description>

      <title>Modeling Income Distribution with the Gause-Witt Population Ecology System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical application of the Gause-Witt model of population ecology and ecosystems to the income distribution competitive dynamics of social classes in economic systems. The Gause-Witt mathematical system of coupled nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations employed to model population of species sharing the same ecological niche and competing for the same resources was applied to the income data of Brazil. Previous studies using Brazilian income data from 1981 to 2009 showed that the complementary cumulative distribution functions built from yearly datasets have two distinct segments: the lower income region comprising of about 99% of the population can be represented by the Gompertz curve, whereas the richest 1% is described by the Pareto power-law. The results of applying the Gause-Witt system to Brazilian income data in order to describe the distributive competition dynamics of these two population shares indicate that the 99% and 1% income classes are mostly in the dynamic state of stable coexistence.</description>

      <title>Evolution and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in local production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have exposed vulnerabilities and caused disruptions of supply chains, leading to product shortages, increased costs, and economic instability. This has prompted increasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm disruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to crises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our understanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network from 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model that generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving the total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level. We show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk undergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic exchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced by the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the null value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller afterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy. Furthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption) becomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international links cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as imports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the supply and demand channels.</description>

      <title>A Better Test of Choice Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choice overload - in which larger choice sets are detrimental to a chooser's well-being - is potentially of great importance in the design of economic policy. Yet the current evidence on its prevalence is inconclusive. We argue that existing tests are likely to be underpowered and hence that choice overload may occur more often than the literature suggests. We propose more powerful tests based on richer data and characterization theorems for the Random Utility Model. These new approaches come with significant econometric challenges, which we show how to address. We apply our tests to new experimental data and find strong evidence of choice overload that would likely be missed using current approaches.</description>

      <title>We must re-evaluate assumptions about carbon trading for effective climate change mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective climate action depends on dismantling the assumptions and oversimplifications that have become the basis of climate policy. The assumption that greenhouse gases (GHG) are fungible and the use of single-point values in normalizing GHG species to CO2-equivalents can propagate inaccuracies in carbon accounting and have already led to failures of carbon offset systems. Separate emission reduction targets and tracking by GHG species are recommended to achieve long-term climate stabilization.</description>

      <title>What is the general Welfare? Welfare Economic Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers do not know what the framers of the United States Constitution intended when they wrote of the general Welfare. Nevertheless, economists can conjecture by specifying social welfare functions that aim to express the preferences of the population. Economists have often simplified utilitarian analysis of public policy by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. In reality, individuals may hold heterogeneous private and social preferences. To enhance policy analysis, I argue that economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences over social states. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for population prosperity and equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity may not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts of equity and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric price adjustment over the business cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of micro-level price datasets find more frequent small price increases than decreases, which can be explained by consumer inattention because time-constrained shoppers might ignore small price changes. Recent empirical studies of the link between shopping behavior and price attention over the business cycle find that consumers are more attentive to prices during economic downturns, and less attentive during economic booms. These two sets of findings have a testable implication. The asymmetry in small price changes should vary over the business cycle. It should diminish during recessions and strengthen during expansions. We test this prediction using a large US store-level dataset with more than 98 million weekly price observations for the years 1989-1997, which includes an 8-month recession period, as defined by the NBER. We compare price adjustments between periods of recession - high unemployment, and expansion - low unemployment. Focusing on small price changes, we find, consistent with our hypothesis, that there is a greater asymmetry in small price changes during periods of low unemployment compared to the periods of high unemployment, implying that firms price-setting behavior varies over the business cycle.</description>

      <title>Exiting National Anti-Poverty Campaign, Social Support, and Improved Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the psychological and social impacts of exiting a national anti-poverty campaign, leveraging China's phase-out of its national poverty assistance as a natural experiment. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that exiting the national campaign improves mental wellbeing. These improvements are accompanied by stronger social and family ties -- such as greater perceived support and communication, while income and material conditions remain largely unchanged. Our findings offer insights into the design of policy exits and underscore the importance of incorporating measures that sustain community- and family-based support systems when implementing or ending assistance programs.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>
