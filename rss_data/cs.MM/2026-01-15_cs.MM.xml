      <title>ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve &lt;75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.</description>

      <title>ABE-VVS: Attribute-Based Encrypted Volumetric Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces ABE-VVS, a framework that performs attribute based selective coordinate encryption for point cloud based volumetric video streaming, enabling lightweight yet effective digital rights management (DRM). Rather than encrypting entire point cloud frames, our approach encrypts only selected subsets of coordinates ($X, Y, Z$, or combinations), lowering computational overhead and latency while still producing strong visual distortion that prevents meaningful unauthorized viewing. Our experiments show that encrypting only the $X$ coordinates achieves effective obfuscation while reducing encryption and decryption times by up to 50% and 80%, respectively, compared to full-frame encryption.
  To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a novel end-to-end evaluation of a DRM-enabled secure point cloud streaming system. We deployed a point cloud video streaming setup on the CloudLab testbed and evaluated three HTTP-based Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) granularities - ABE-XYZ (encrypting all $X,Y,Z$ coordinates), ABE-XY, and ABE-X against conventional HTTPS/TLS secure streaming as well as an HTTP-only baseline without any security. Our streaming evaluation demonstrates that ABE-based schemes reduce server-side CPU load by up to 80% and cache CPU load by up to 63%, comparable to HTTP-only, while maintaining similar cache hit rates. Moreover, ABE-XYZ and ABE-XY exhibit lower client-side rebuffering than HTTPS, and ABE-X achieves zero rebuffering comparable to HTTP-only. Although ABE-VVS increases client-side CPU usage, the overhead is not large enough to affect streaming quality and is offset by its broader benefits, including simplified key revocation, elimination of per-client encryption, and reduced server and cache load.</description>

      <title>Research on Piano Timbre Transformation System Based on Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a timbre conversion model based on the Diffusion architecture de-signed to precisely translate music played by various instruments into piano ver-sions. The model employs a Pitch Encoder and Loudness Encoder to extract pitch and loudness features of the music, which serve as conditional inputs to the Dif-fusion Model's decoder, generating high-quality piano timbres. Case analysis re-sults show that the model performs excellently in terms of pitch accuracy and timbral similarity, maintaining stable conversion across different musical styles (classical, jazz, pop) and lengths (from short clips to full pieces). Particularly, the model maintains high sound quality and accuracy even when dealing with rapidly changing notes and complex musical structures, demonstrating good generaliza-tion capability. Additionally, the model has the potential for real-time musical conversion and is suitable for live performances and digital music creation tools. Future research will focus on enhancing the handling of loudness dynamics and incorporating additional musical features (such as timbral variations and rhythmic complexity) to improve the model's adaptability and expressiveness. We plan to explore the model's application potential in other timbre conversion tasks, such as converting vocals to instrumental sounds or integration with MIDI digital pianos, further expanding the application scope of the Diffusion-based timbre conversion model in the field of music generation.</description>

      <title>SLAM-LLM: A Modular, Open-Source Multimodal Large Language Model Framework and Best Practice for Speech, Language, Audio and Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) frameworks, such as LLaVA, provides a convenient kickoff for artificial intelligence developers and researchers. However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing.</description>
