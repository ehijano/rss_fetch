      <description>arXiv:2501.01466v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent Comment (arXiv:2411.10522, Nat Rev Phys 7, 2 (2025)), fifteen prominent leaders in the field of condensed matter physics declare that hydride superconductivity is real and urge funding agencies to continue to support the field. I question the validity and constructiveness of their argument.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-enhanced non-reciprocal superconductivity: application to multi-valley superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here propose and study theoretically a non-equilibrium mechanism for the superconducting diode effect, which applies specifically to the case where time-reversal-symmetry -- a prerequisite for the diode effect -- is spontaneously broken by the superconducting electrons themselves. We employ a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau formalism to capture dissipation effects in the non-equilibrium current-carrying state via phase slips and show that the coupling of the resistive current to the symmetry-breaking order is enough to induce a diode effect. Depending on parameters, the critical current asymmetry can be sizeable, asymptotically reaching a perfect diode efficiency; the competition of symmetry-breaking order, superconducting and resistive currents gives rise to rich physics, such as current-stabilized, non-equilibrium superconducting correlations. Although our mechanism is more general, the findings are particularly relevant to twisted trilayer and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, where the symmetry-breaking order parameter refers to the imbalance of the two valleys of the systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder can increase the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition substantially. The phenomenon can be interpreted as an effective negative moment of inertia associated with condensation of Cooper pairs. We give quantitative estimates for a thin cylinder of aluminum.</description>

      <title>Light Interaction With a Space-Time-Modulated Josephson Junction Array and Application to Angular-Frequency Beam Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions, as pivotal components of modern technologies such as superconducting quantum computing, owe their prominence to their unique nonlinear properties at low temperatures. Despite their extensive use in static configurations, the study of dynamic Josephson junctions, particularly under space-time modulation, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the interaction and transmission of electromagnetic waves through arrays of space-time-modulated Josephson junctions. A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented to model the propagation of electric and magnetic fields within and beyond these structures. We demonstrate how such dynamic arrays enable groundbreaking four-dimensional light manipulation, achieving angular-frequency beam multiplexing through a seamless integration of frequency conversion and beam-splitting functionalities. These advancements open new horizons for electromagnetic field engineering, with far-reaching implications for superconducting quantum technologies, next-generation wireless communications, biomedical sensing, and radar systems.</description>

      <title>The coherence peak of unconventional superconductors in the charge channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a systematic investigation of the coherence peak in unconventional superconductors as they transition into the superconducting phase at $T_c$. Using $d$-wave cuprates as an example, we reveal the presence of a coherence peak below $T_c$ in the charge channel. The nuclear quadrupole relaxation rate is shown to be an effective method for detecting this unconventional coherence peak, with the superconducting coherence factor playing a pivotal role in its emergence. Additionally, we explore the influence of correlation effects, which further enhance this phenomenon. Extending our analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a similar coherence peak in ultrasonic attenuation and iron-based superconductors. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on probing superconducting gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>High critical field superconductivity in a 3d dominated lightweight equiatomic high entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lightweight high entropy alloy represents an innovative class of multicomponent systems that combine low density with the exceptional mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys. We present a detailed synthesis and investigation of a 3d rich equiatomic high entropy alloy superconductor Sc-Ti-V-Nb-Cu, which crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure. Magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity measurements confirm weakly coupled bulk type II superconductivity with a 7.21(3) K transition temperature and an upper critical field of 12.9(1) T. The upper critical field approaches the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggesting potential unconventional behavior. The low density, moderate transition temperature, and high upper critical field stand out Sc-Ti-V-Nb-Cu as a promising candidate for next-generation superconducting device applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structures of topological kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the $z$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal $T_3X$, kagome intercalation metal $TX$, and the ternary compounds $AT_6X_6$ and $RT_3X_5$ ($A$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; $T$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; $X$ = Sn, Ge; $R$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.</description>

      <title>A high-speed, high-resolution Transition Edge Sensor spectrometer for soft X-rays at the Advanced Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project explores the design and development of a transition edge sensor (TES) spectrometer for resonant soft X- ray scattering (RSXS) measurements developed in collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Soft X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of materials on a microscopic level. However, the lack of high-performance soft X-ray spectrometers has limited the potential of this technique. TES spectrometers have the potential to overcome these limitations due to their high energy resolution, high efficiency, and broad energy range. This project aims to optimize the design of a TES spectrometer for RSXS measurements and more generally soft X-ray spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 29-ID, leading to improved understanding of advanced materials. We will present a detailed description of the instrument design and implementation. The spectrometer consists of a large array of approximately 250 high-speed and high-resolution pixels. The pixels have saturation energies of approximately 1 keV, sub-ms pulse duration and energy resolution of approximately 1 eV. The array is read out using microwave multiplexing chips with MHz bandwidth per channel, enabling efficient data throughput. To facilitate measurement of samples in situ under ultra-high vacuum conditions at the beamline, the spectrometer is integrated with an approximately 1 m long snout.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing driven topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Back-action supercurrent diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tuneable resonator fabricated with a neon focused-ion-beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.</description>

      <title>Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</description>
