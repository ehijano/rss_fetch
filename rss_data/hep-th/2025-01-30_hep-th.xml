      <title>Critical String Theory in a $D=4$ Robertson-Walker Background and the Large Scale Structure of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $4$-dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetimes can be constructed for which all of the beta functions vanish to leading order, yielding consistent string theory without extra dimensions. We find that there is a unique static solution, which we refer to as an anti-Einstein static universe. The associated stress energy tensor can be interpreted as a perfect fluid with a negative energy density. Interestingly, a fluid with a negative energy density was proposed in [2] as an ad hoc hypothesis to serve as a possible explanation for dark energy and dark matter. Here, such a fluid spontaneously appears by trying to fit string theory into only $4$ dimensions. We can look at perturbations away from the anti-Einstein static universe. This has to be done numerically and we only do it for a few choices of initial conditions. We find that these solutions are very sensitive to the initial conditions and yield a variety of behaviors. We hope that this behavior is rich enough to match cosmological observations by appropriately choosing the initial conditions. One of these solutions that we found is particularly interesting. It has a hubble parameter which is negative in the past (meaning a contracting universe), then a point at which the hubble parameter changes sign, so the universe starts expanding which could be identified with a big bang, after which the hubble parameter continues growing. Throughout all of this time, the acceleration is positive since the Hubble parameter is increasing. Finally, we comment that our result does not contradict [1] as it seems that the authors overlooked the possibility of a purely complex axion field which allows for the Robertson-Walker metrics to make a contribution $c_{RW}\geq 4$ to the central charge. Thus, we can interpret dark matter and dark energy as being parts of a mechanism needed to keep $4$-dimensional string theory consistent.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Grey Galaxies, Dual Dressed Black Holes and the Superconformal Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent construction of grey galaxy and Dual Dressed Black Hole solutions in $AdS_5\times S^5$, we present two conjectures relating to the large $N$ entropy of supersymmetric states in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory. Our first conjecture asserts the existence of a large number of supersymmetric states which can be thought of as a non interacting mix of supersymmetric black holes and supersymmetric `gravitons'. It predicts a microcanonical phase diagram of supersymmetric states with eleven distinct phases, and makes a sharp prediction for the supersymmetric entropy (as a function of 5 charges) in each of these phases. The microcanonical version of the superconformal index involves a sum over states - with alternating signs - over a line in 5 parameter charge space. Our second conjecture asserts that this sum is dominated by the point on the line that has the largest supersymmetric entropy. This conjecture predicts a large $N$ formula for the superconformal index as a function of indicial charges, and predicts a microcanonical indicial phase diagram with nine distinct phases. It predicts agreement between the superconformal index and black hole entropy in one phase (so over one range of charges), but disagreement in other phases (and so at other values of charges). We compare our predictions against numerically evaluated superconformal index at $N\leq10$, and find qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Nesting is not Contracting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The default way of proving holographic entropy inequalities is the contraction method. It divides Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on the `greater than' side of the inequality into segments, then glues the segments into candidate RT surfaces for terms on the `less than' side. Here we discuss how proofs by contraction are constrained and informed by entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) -- the property that enlarging a boundary region can only enlarge its entanglement wedge. We propose that: (i) all proofs by contraction necessarily involve candidate RT surfaces, which violate EWN; (ii) violations of EWN in contraction proofs of maximally tight inequalities occur commonly and -- where this can be quantified -- with maximal density near boundary conditions; (iii) the non-uniqueness of proofs by contraction reflects inequivalent ways of violating EWN. As evidence and illustration, we study the recently discovered infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities, which are associated with tessellations of the torus and the projective plane. We explain the logic, which underlies their proofs by contraction. We find that all salient aspects of the requisite contraction maps are dictated by EWN while all their variable aspects set the scheme for how to violate EWN. We comment on whether the tension between EWN and contraction maps might help in characterizing maximally tight holographic entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions in four-dimensional superconformal long circular quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two- and three-point correlation functions of chiral primary half-BPS operators in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal circular, cyclic symmetric quiver theories. Using supersymmetric localization, these functions can be expressed as matrix integrals which, in the planar limit, reduce to Fredholm determinants of certain semi-infinite matrices. This powerful representation allows us to investigate the correlation functions across the parameter space of the quiver theory, including both weak and strong coupling regimes and various limits of the number of nodes and the operator scaling dimensions. At strong coupling, the standard semiclassical AdS/CFT expansion diverges in the long quiver limit. However, by incorporating both perturbative corrections (in negative powers of the 't Hooft coupling) and an infinite tower of nonperturbative, exponentially suppressed contributions, we derive a remarkably simple expression for the correlation functions in this limit. These functions exhibit exponential decay with increasing node separation and admit an interpretation within a five-dimensional effective theory. We determine the mass spectrum of excitations propagating along the emergent fifth dimension within this theory, finding it to be given by the zeros of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Orbifolds, Rank Reduction and Heterotic Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider toroidal asymmetric orbifolds of the heterotic string preserving all 16 supercharges, developing a general formalism to study components of the moduli space characterized by rank reduction of the gauge group. In particular we construct six- and four-dimensional heterotic islands with no massless moduli other than the dilaton. The formalism involves the Leech lattice, its automorphisms and their corresponding invariant and normal, or coinvariant, sublattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum induced superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance, the phenomenon enabling energy extraction through radiation amplification, is not universal to all black holes. We show that semi-classical backreaction can induce superradiance, even when absent at the classical level. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field probing a family of rotating `quantum' black holes in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, accounting for all orders of backreaction due to quantum conformal matter. A subset of these modes is identified as superradiant, leading to the formation of quantum black hole `bombs'. All such quantum black holes have curvature singularities shrouded by horizons. Thus, while backreaction enforces cosmic censorship, it also renders the black holes dynamically unstable. Further, we find all thermally unstable black holes are dynamically unstable, though the converse does not hold generally. Our findings thus suggest a semiclassical version of the Gubser-Mitra conjecture on black hole stability. This motivates us to propose a stability criterion for quantum black holes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Limit of Null Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries and the dimensional reduction of 6d so SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction on a torus of the family of 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs UV completing an $so(N)$ gauge theory with $N-8$ vector hypermultiplets. These SCFTs are known to possess a rich structure of discrete symmetries, notably 0-form and 1-form symmetries, which often merge to form a higher group structure, both split and non-split. We investigate what happens to this symmetry structure once the theory is reduced on a circle to 5d and on a torus to 4d, especially when a non-trivial Stiefel-Whitney class for the flavor symmetry is turned on. Unlike in Lagrangian theories, here the 1-form symmetries of the 6d theory reduce to non-trivially acting 1-form and 0-form symmetries, and the original higher group structure leads to an extension of the 0-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Gleaning gravitational amplitudes -- a double copy for canceling dilatons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes in general relativity can be conveniently computed using the double copy, which relates them to Yang-Mills amplitudes. However, unwanted dilatons are sourced by massive scalar matter, which must be removed from the double copy in order to match the long range gravitational interactions. In this paper, we study how to automatically cancel out the dilatons by finding a suitable double-copy prescription in terms of gauge-theory fields, effectively treating the new contributions as ghosts that subtract out the unwanted states. At tree level, we find that an asymmetric double copy can reproduce the dilaton graphs in general dimension, which we explicitly verify up to six external massive scalars. Considering a one-loop four-point example, the same asymmetric double copy needs to be supplemented by the subtraction of bubble graphs that originate both from the axion and a residual dilaton term.</description>

      <title>On heat coefficients, multiplicative anomaly and 4D Casimir energy for GJMS operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims to verify a prediction on the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly, and the corresponding heat coefficient, for GJMS operators. It stems from the explicit computation of an {\it improved} Casimir (or vacuum) energy on the sphere that takes into account the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors and connects, via the Cappelli-Coste relation, with both the type A central charge and the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly. The present heat coefficient computation is based on Juhl's explicit formula for GJMS operators, Gilkey's formula for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order Laplacians, and the \textit{conformal principle} by Branson and {\O}rsted.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01412v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological applications for interacting matters, an extension of the action functional for relativistic fluids is proposed to incorporate the physics of non-adiabatic processes and chemical reactions. The former are characterised by entropy growth, while the latter violate particle number conservation. The relevance of these physics is demonstrated in the contexts of self-interacting fluids, fluids interacting with scalar fields, and hyperhydrodynamical interactions with geometry. The possible cosmological applications range from early-universe phase transitions to astrophysical phenomena, and from matter creation inflationary alternatives to interacting dark sector alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM model that aim to address its tensions. As an example of the latter, a single fluid model of a unified dark sector is presented. The simple action of the model features one field and one parameter, yet it can both reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and predict new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Unimodular JT gravity and de Sitter quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that a gauge-theoretic description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity naturally yields a Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) unimodular gravity via a central extension of its isometry group, valid for both flat and curved two-dimensional spacetimes. HT gravity introduces a unimodular time canonically conjugate to the cosmological constant, serving as a physical time in quantum cosmology. By studying the mini-superspace reduction of $\text{HT}_2$ gravity, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving a consistent and unitary quantum theory. Analysis of the wavefunction's probability density reveals a quantum distribution for the scale factor $a$, offering a quantum perspective on the expansion and contraction of the universe. In this perspective, the possibility of reaching the singular point $a=0$ signals that topology change could occur. Finally, we give a consistent quantum description of unimodular time that aligns seamlessly with Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics, where quantum correlations between unimodular time and JT gravity are studied in $\text{HT}_2$ quantum cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, we achieve consistency with the theory input and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.</description>

      <title>Emergent multifractality in power-law decaying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality is of significant interest with potential applications in various fields of quantum physics. Most of the previous studies concentrated on fine-tuned quantum models to realize multifractality which is generally believed to be a critical phenomenon and fragile to random perturbations. In this work, we propose a set of generic principles based on the power-law decay of the eigenstates which allow us to distinguish a fractal phase from a genuine multifractal phase. We demonstrate the above principles in a 1d tight-binding model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping that can be mapped to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator via energy-coordinate duality. We analytically calculate the fractal dimensions and the spectrum of fractal dimensions which are in agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>When alcoved polytopes add</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are characterized by the property that all facet normal directions are parallel to the roots $e_i-e_j$. Unlike other prominent families of polytopes, like generalized permutahedra, alcoved polytopes are not closed under Minkowski sums. We nonetheless show that the Minkowski sum of a collection of alcoved polytopes is alcoved if and only if each pairwise sum is alcoved. This implies that the type fan of alcoved polytopes is determined by its two-dimensional cones. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of when the Minkowski sum of alcoved simplices is again alcoved via a graphical criterion on pairs of ordered set partitions. Our characterization reduces to checking conditions on restricted partitions of length at most six. In particular, we show how the Minkowski sum decompositions of the two most well-known families of alcoved polytopes, the associahedron and the cyclohedron, fit in our framework. Additionally, inspired by the physical construction of one-loop scattering amplitudes, we present a new infinite family of alcoved polytopes, called $\widehat{D}_n$ polytopes. We conclude by drawing a connection to matroidal blade arrangements and the Dressian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collinear matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions at large values of $x$, computing and resumming the leading large-$x$ asymptotics for matching coefficients. The large-$x$ resummation is done directly within TMD distributions, ensuring the process-independence of the result. The derived resummation formulas are valid for all TMD distributions (except the pretzelosity). Their application improves perturbative convergence, provides practical estimation for unknown higher-order contributions, and sets restrictions for the nonperturbative part of models. Using the known anomalous dimensions, resummation can reach N$^3$LL, often exceeding the accuracy of known coefficient functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between a one-parameter family of (anti)-de Sitter Yang-Mills models and Einstein-Palatini gravity in the absence of matter, realized via a In\"o\"nu-Wigner contraction of the (A)-dS algebra. The Yang-Mills action is shown to reproduce the Einstein equations of General Relativity when the parameter labelling the gauge group is set to zero. In this limit the components of the gauge connection consistently reduce to tetrads and spin connection, transforming in the standard way under the local Lorentz group. Moreover, the full gauge symmetry of the Yang-Mills action gives rise to the invariance under diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Inverse logarithmic correction in the HBAR entropy of an atom falling into a renormalization group improved charged black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have considered a spherically symmetric non-rotating charged black hole geometry where both the Newton's gravitational constant and the charge of the black hole flows with the energy scale. We have used the Kretschmann scale identification to write down the finite cutoff for the momentum scale in terms of the proper distance. Introducing the flow of running couplings, the event horizon radius of the black hole using quantum improved Reissner-Nordstrom metric was found in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.066016}{Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 066016}. We have, in this work, explored the thought experiment of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum improved charged black hole and have computed the transition probability of the atom for going from its ground state to the excited state via emission of a virtual photon. We find that the probability deviates slightly from the pure Planckian spectrum. We have showed that this deviation is due to the presence of incomplete lower gamma function in the distribution function. We have then computed the horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy and found that it is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy followed by the renormalization group correction terms including an inverse logarithmic and a square root of the area term due to emitting photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the nonequilibrium fluctuational forces and torques acting on a body either in motion or at rest relative to another body or the thermal vacuum blackbody radiation. For a moving body, a retarding force emerges, called quantum or Casimir friction, which in vacuum was first predicted by Einstein and Hopf in 1907. Moreover, if a stationary body is not in thermal equilibrium with the blackbody vacuum, a self-propulsive force or torque can appear, resulting in a potentially observable linear or angular terminal velocity, even after thermalization.</description>

      <title>Zubarev response approach to polarization phenomena in local equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the expansion of Zubarev's density operator, we develop a linear response approach to study various spin physics in a locally equilibrated medium, particularly focusing on various polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we connect familiar correlation functions and diagrammatic methods to the Zubarev formalism, enabling the use of established techniques like the Matsubara/imaginary time formalism to facilitate calculations. For a spin-1/2 particle, we re-derive its vector polarization using this Zubarev response approach, which exactly reproduces with our previous results based on Luttinger's method. For a spin-1 particle, we calculate the vector polarization and find the expected contributions from vorticity, temperature gradients, and shear, which are identical to those for spin-1/2 particles except for a factor of 4/3 as expected. For the tensor polarization and spin alignment of a spin-1 boson, we explicitly prove that the non-dissipative contribution is zero at leading order in gradients, and briefly reiterate our previous findings for the dissipative contribution with further discussions on several concerns. Additionally, we discuss several relevant subtleties and questions, including an alternative derivation for Zubarev response approach, the covariance issues of different spin density matrix definitions, a further explanation of slow and fast modes, the mode selection scheme, etc. We also discuss skeleton expansions, higher-order contributions, and non-perturbative methods, particularly their potential connection to lattice field theory. In summary, this work discusses the foundations and subtleties of Zubarev response approach, with specific examples from spin physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We study two-dimensional topological gauge theories with gauge group equal to the symmetric group $S_n$ and their string theory duals. The simplest such theory is the topological quantum field theory of principal $S_n$ fiber bundles. Its correlators are equal to Hurwitz numbers. The operator products in the gauge theory for each finite value of $n$ are coded in a partial permutation algebra. We propose a generalization of the partial permutation algebra to any symmetric orbifold topological quantum field theory and show that the latter theory factorizes into marked partial permutation combinatorics and seed Frobenius algebra properties. Moreover, we exploit the established correspondence between Hurwitz theory and the stationary sector of Gromov-Witten theory on the sphere to prove an exact gauge/string duality. The relevant field theory is a grand canonical version of Hurwitz theory and its two-point functions are obtained by summing over all values of the instanton degree of the maps covering the sphere. We stress that one must look for a multiplicative basis on the boundary to match the bulk operator algebra of single string insertions. The relevant boundary observables are completed cycles.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

Abstract: We study six-dimensional $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with a non-semisimple $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity arises from a consistent truncation of type IIB string theory on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface. We find that the gauged supergravity admits two $SO(3)$ symmetric $AdS_6$ vacua, one with $N=(1,1)$ supersymmetry and the other one non-supersymmetric. We compute all scalar masses at these critical points and find that only the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum is stable. By truncating to $SO(3)\times U(1)$ and $SO(2)\times U(1)$ invariant sectors, we study holographic RG flow solutions from this critical point to a number of non-conformal phases of the dual $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions. Finally, we give some examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions describing conformal interfaces within the five-dimensional SCFT. All of these solutions provide first holographic results from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with non-semisimple gauge groups.</description>

Abstract: Continuing our program of deriving aspects of celestial holography from string theory, we extend the Roiban-Spradlin-Volovich-Witten (RSVW) formalism to celestial amplitudes. We reformulate the tree-level maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial leaf amplitudes for gluons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and for gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity in terms of minitwistor wavefunctions. These are defined as representatives of cohomology classes on the minitwistor space $\mathbf{MT}$, associated to the three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space. In this framework, celestial leaf amplitudes are expressed as integrals over the moduli space of minitwistor lines. We construct a minitwistor generating functional for MHV leaf amplitudes using the Quillen determinant line bundle, extending the approach originally developed by Boels, Mason and Skinner. Building on this formalism, we propose supersymmetric celestial conformal field theories (CFTs) as $\sigma$-models, where the worldsheet is given by the celestial supersphere $\mathbf{CP}^{1|2}$, and the target space is the minitwistor superspace $\mathbf{MT}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$. We demonstrate that the semiclassical effective action of these $\sigma$-models reproduces the MHV gluonic and gravitational leaf amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity. This construction provides a concrete realisation of the supersymmetric celestial CFT framework recently introduced by Tropper (2024).</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative corrections in the semi-classical limit of double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the disk partition function of double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) in the small $\lambda$ limit, where $\lambda=-\log q$ is the coupling of DSSYK. We find that the partition function receives non-perturbative corrections in $\lambda$, which can be resummed by the cubic power of the Dedekind eta function in a certain low temperature limit. We also discuss a possible bulk interpretation of our findings.</description>

      <title>Connecting Through Obstruction; Relating Gauge Gravity and String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1604.03980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we provide a more detailed account of the geometry and topology of the composite bundle formalism introduced by Tresguerres in Phys. Rev. D 66 (2002) 064025 [1] to accommodate gravitation as a gauge theory. In the first half of the article we identify a global structure required by the composite construction which not only exposes how the ordinary frame and tangent bundle expected in general relativity arise but provides the link or connection between these ordinary bundles and the gauge bundles of the composite bundle construction. In the second half of the article we discuss implications of this method of constructing gravity as a fiber bundle for the global structure of spacetime. We find that the underlying manifold of the composite bundle construction is expected to admit, not only a spin structure but also a string structure. As a consequence of our work we are able to extend past work on global structures of physically reasonable spacetime manifolds. It has been shown that in four spacetime dimensions, that if an oriented, Lorentzian, four dimensional manifold is stably casual that it is parallizable, and hence admits a spin structure which allows for chiral spinors. We may now add to this that such a manifold also admits a string structure.</description>

      <title>Domain wall interpretation of the PTA signal confronting black hole overproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have detected a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hz frequencies, with Domain Wall networks (DWs) proposed as potential sources. To be cosmologically viable, they must annihilate before dominating the universe energy budget, thus generating a SGWB. While sub-horizon DWs shrink and decay rapidly, causality requires DWs with super-horizon size to continue growing until they reach the Hubble horizon. Those entering the latest can be heavier than a Hubble patch and collapse into Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We conduct a Bayesian analysis of the PTA signal, interpreting it as an outcome of SGWB from DW networks, with a prior ensuring no PBH overproduction. Our findings indicate that DWs result in the production of solar-mass PBHs. The binary mergers occurring within these PBHs generate a second SGWB in the kilo-Hz domain which could be observable in on-going or planned Earth-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation of renormalization group improved regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a renormalization group approach based on the idea that the primary contribution to the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime arises from the value of the gravitational coupling. The latter depends on the distance from the origin and approaches its classical value in the far zone. However, at some stage, this approach introduces an arbitrariness in choosing an identification parameter. There are three approaches to the identification: the modified proper length (the Bonanno-Reuter metric), the Kretschmann scalar (the Hayward metric), and an iterative, and, in a sense, coordinate-independent procedure (Dymnikova solution). Using the WKB method, we calculated grey-body factors for the Standard Model massless test fields and their corresponding energy emission rates. For all of these solutions, we found that the intensity of Hawking radiation of massless fields is significantly suppressed by several or more orders once the quantum correction is taken into consideration. This indicates that the effect of suppression of the Hawking radiation may be appropriate to the quantum corrected black holes in asymptotically safe gravity in general and is independent on the particular choice of the identification parameter.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the time evolution of quantum entanglement in presence of non-collapsing interactions. In particular, the entanglement between the products of a muon decay in a magnetic field is revisited. It results from angular momentum conservation and leads to an anomaly in the measured muon g factor in precise agreement with that reported by the Brookhaven and Fermilab experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover the solution space of a five dimensional geometry which we deem it as the direct counterpart of the Bianchi Type V cosmological model. We kinematically reduce the scale factor matrix and then, with an appropriate scaling and choice of time, we cast the spatial equations into a simple "Kasner" like form; thus revealing linear integrals of motion. Their number is enough so that, along with the quadratic constraint, it suffices to scan the entire space of solutions. The latter is revealed to be quite rich, containing cosmological solutions, some of which admit dimensional reduction asymptotically to four dimensions, Kundt spacetimes with vanishing type I (polynomial) curvature scalars and solutions describing periodic universes which behave like cosmological time crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the construction of Alcubierre-Nat\'{a}rio class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resembles the Weak Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three dimensional spacetimes introduce conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and the (NEC) violations associated with these warp drives and find interesting scalings due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Other properties like tilting of light cones, event horizons and several generalisations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a flat background with a gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states, and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. We split a generic GW burst into two profiles with and without memory. GW burst with (without) memory profiles have different (similar) asymptotic strains between early and late times. We observe that for eternal switching, there is a finite change in the collective atomic transition rate due to the memory part of the GW burst, while the contribution from the without memory counterpart vanishes. We also consider finite Gaussian switching and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only the memory part contributes to the radiative process. Thus, although examined in a simplified set-up, our findings suggest the potential to distinguish bursts with and without GW memory based on the radiative process of entangled detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as a dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.</description>
