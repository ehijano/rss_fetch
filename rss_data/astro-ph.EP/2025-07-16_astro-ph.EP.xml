      <title>Breaking the Mass Inclination Degeneracy of Radial Velocity Measurements via Monitoring von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Cycles: Implications in the HD 41004 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability of the S-type planet in the compact binary HD 41004. Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be dynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\sim75^\circ$. The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination is greater than 39.2$^\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession. Synthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations produce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full vZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual inclination at 75$^\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per planetary orbit ($\sim 1.9 \,\text{m s}^{-1}\, \text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular binary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these drifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system offer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and thus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination is well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD 41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising targets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the vZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Evolution of the Unstratified Polydisperse Dust Settling Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability (SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has growth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas ratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong dust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear saturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence behaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By characterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we can shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform a suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the mono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum dust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as analyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse simulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates earlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The polydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and produce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the monodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but separate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further clumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at densities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI produces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests that the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than the SI from including a dust size distribution.</description>

      <title>The Surfaces of Small to Mid-Size Plutinos: Evidence of an Association Between Inclination and Surface Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being one of the most populated mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune and lying close to the inner boundary of the present day cold classical disk, observations of the orbital and surface class distributions of the plutinos in the 3:2 MMR provide constraints on Neptune's migration and insight into the compositional structure of the pre-migration planetesimal disk. Here, we present observations of the surface reflectance of 43 small to mid-size (H_V &gt;~ 5) transneptunian objects (TNOs) through the grz wavelength range, 14 of which are plutinos. We classify the surfaces of these TNOs using the two-surface class model (FaintIR and BrightIR surface classes) proposed by Fraser and collaborators, where the FaintIR surface class is dominated by cold classicals. Incorporating similar observations of plutinos from the literature for a total sample size of 43 plutinos, we find that the osculating inclination distributions (i_osc) of the FaintIR and BrightIR plutinos are statistically distinguishable at 99.3% significance, where (6/7) of the plutinos with i_osc &gt; 4.5{\deg} have FaintIR surfaces. This is most easily explained if the FaintIR and BrightIR planetesimals were radially partitioned in the primordial planetesimal disk before being captured into the 3:2 resonance. While this could be evidence that the primordial cold classical disk with FaintIR surfaces was broader in the past by ~3 au in the sunward direction, we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that these FaintIR plutinos were scattered from the ~42.5-48 au region from the Sun and captured into the 3:2 resonance.</description>

      <title>Effect of Galactic Chemical Evolution on Exoplanet Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We couple a simplified model for the galactic chemical evolution, with software that models the condensation of dust in protoplanetary disks and software that models the interior structure of planets in order to estimate the effects that the galactic chemical evolution has on the properties of planets as they form over time. We find that the early abundance of elements formed from the evolution and death of high-mass stars (such as Oxygen, Silicon, and Magnesium) yields planets with larger mantles and smaller cores. The later addition of elements produced in low-mass stars (such as Iron and Nickel) causes the planet cores to become relatively larger. The result is planets that orbit older stars are less dense than planets orbiting younger stars. These results are broadly consistent with recent observations of planet properties from stars of varying ages.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of the vertical shear instability with dynamic dust and cooling rates in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate turbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires rapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control VSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical motion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how turbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the VSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution associated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of the equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives turbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These simulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution, cooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and local cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a dimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability of the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to dust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with the prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara &amp; Okuzumi (2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient cooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in VSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size. This suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-II. Analytical study on the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In triple systems of weak hierarchies, nonlinear perturbations arising from the periodic oscillations associated with the inner and outer binaries play a crucial role in shaping their long-term dynamical evolution. In this context, we have developed an extended Brown Hamiltonian in Paper I, which serves as a fundamental model for describing the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK oscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space structures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the boundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to trigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov integral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component of angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found that the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is consistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical predictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement between them. Notably, the results reveal that ZLK characteristics in prograde and retrograde regimes are no longer symmetric under the influence of Brown corrections. At last, we conduct $N$-body integrations about millions of orbits to generate dynamical maps, where the numerical structures are well captured by the analytical solutions derived from the extended model.</description>

      <title>On Hot Jupiters and Stellar Clustering: The Role of Host Star Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variation in hot Jupiter (HJ) occurrence across stellar environments holds clues as to the dominant formation channels of these extreme planets. Recent studies suggest HJ hosts preferentially reside in regions of high phase space density, possibly reflecting natal environmental conditions. These regions are kinematically cold (|v| &lt; 40 km/s), prompting the alternative hypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in overdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have undergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess of HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host properties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space density or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We derive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of planet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and self-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample of 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs orbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities preferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared to underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending the phase space density against age or by matching host properties across subsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between over- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported correlation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by underlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic environmental effect.</description>

      <title>Poro-viscoelastic tidal heating of Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Io's tidally-driven global volcanism indicates widespread partial melting in its mantle. How this melt participates in the interior dynamics, and, in particular, the role it plays in tidal dissipation, is poorly understood. We model Io's tidal deformation by treating its mantle as a two-phase (solid and melt) system. By combining poro-viscous and poro-elastic compaction theories in a Maxwell framework with a consistent model of tidal and self-gravitation, we produce the first self-consistent evaluation of Io's tidal heating rate due to shearing, compaction, and Darcy flow.
  We find that Darcy dissipation can potentially exceed shear heating, but only for large (0.05 to 0.2) melt fractions, and if the grain size is large or melt viscosity ultra-low. Since grain sizes larger than 1~cm are unlikely, this suggests that Darcy dissipation is secondary to shear dissipation. Compaction dissipation is maximised when the asthenosphere is highly resistive to isotropic stresses, but contributes at most 1% of Io's observed heating rate.
  This work represents a crucial step toward a self-consistent quantitative theory for the dynamics of Io's partially molten interior.</description>

      <title>The model is the message: Lightweight convolutional autoencoders applied to noisy imaging data for planetary science and astrobiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of convolutional autoencoder deep learning to imaging data for planetary science and astrobiological use is briefly reviewed and explored with a focus on the need to understand algorithmic rationale, process, and results when machine learning is utilized. Successful autoencoders train to build a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced form (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original input. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here a baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the utility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where there is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero returned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels across pixel channels). It is shown that, in certain use cases, multi-color image reconstruction can be usefully applied even with extensive random destructive noise with 90% areal coverage and higher. This capability is discussed in the context of intentional masking to reduce data bandwidth, or situations with low-illumination levels and other factors that obscure image data (e.g., sensor degradation or atmospheric conditions). It is further suggested that for some scientific use cases the model latent space and representations have more utility than large raw imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>A Transiting Giant on a 7.7-Year Orbit Revealed by TTVs in the TOI-201 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection and characterization of TOI-201 c, a long-period transiting companion to the warm Jupiter TOI-201 b. Its presence was first inferred from high-amplitude transit timing variations (TTVs) in TOI-201 b, pointing to a massive outer body on a $7.7^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$-year eccentric orbit. This prediction was confirmed when TESS observed a transit of TOI-201 c, precisely constraining its orbital geometry. A joint fit to TTVs, transit photometry, and archival radial velocities yields a mass of $14.2^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.643^{+0.009}_{-0.021}$. The mutual inclination between planets b and c is $2.9^{+4.8}_{-4.4}$ degrees, indicating a nearly coplanar architecture. Long-term numerical integrations confirm dynamical stability over gigayear timescales and predict that transits of TOI-201 b will cease within a few thousand years. TOI-201 c ranks among the longest-period transiting planets with well-constrained properties. Its detection via TTVs, followed by a confirmed transit, represents a rare observational sequence and highlights the power of TTVs and photometric monitoring to uncover distant companions. The TOI-201 system offers a valuable laboratory for testing models of giant planet formation, migration, and secular evolution in multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Space-filling efficiency and optical properties of hemoglycin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empty, extensive low-density lattice topology of hemoglycin is examined to understand how in space, and possibly as early as 800M years into cosmic time a rod-like polymer of glycine and iron came into dominance. A central question to be answered is whether the hemoglycin rod lattice with diamond 2H symmetry represents the most efficient covering of space by a regular arrangement of identical rods. Starting from the tetrahedral symmetry of every hemoglycin lattice vertex we find that the regular truncated tetrahedron of Archimedes may be expanded until neighboring hexagon faces are coincident, at which point space filling is 23/24 or 95.8333% complete. We describe the unit cells of the diamond 2H rod lattice and its conforming near-complete space-filling structure, which has identical symmetry. Maximum space filling via a minimum of molecular material can allow hemoglycin to drive accretion in molecular clouds, contributing to the composition of dust, and providing a background for its widespread presence in meteoritic samples and in cometary material that falls to Earth. The optical properties of hemoglycin lattice entities are derived from quantum calculations of ultraviolet and visible transition energies and strengths. The hemoglycin extinction curve duplicates the nominal 218nm ultraviolet absorption feature known as the UV bump, together with two visible absorption features present in a generic compilation of astronomical extinction data.</description>

      <title>A New Method for the Discovery of the Distant Exoplanets II: Question of Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets with a long orbital period are difficult to discover by extant methods. Our first publication (Lerner, P., A. Mayer, T. E. Sullivan. 2023. A new method for the discovery of the distant exoplanets. SPIE Proceedings 12680: 126802(M)) proposed a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry-inspired method to find exoplanets with a very slow-changing influence on their host star. Traditional HBT interferometry measured the modulus of the correlation function. Slight modification of the HBT can determine its real part. Simultaneous observation of both characteristics, e.g. in a binocular setting of telescopes, is exceptionally sensitive to the asymmetry of the luminous object. However, the issue of a very small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HBT makes application of this method difficult. In the current paper, we discuss the possibilities to enhance the low SNR of the method.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Knotted Electron Diffusion Region in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that alters the magnetic field topology and releases magnetic energy. Most numerical simulations and spacecraft observations assume a two-dimensional diffusion region, with the electron diffusion region (EDR) embedded in the same plane as the ion diffusion region (IDR) and a uniform guide field throughout. Using observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we report a non-coplanar, knotted EDR in Earth's magnetotail current sheet. The reconnection plane of the knotted EDR deviates by approximately 38{\deg} from that of the IDR, with the guide field exhibiting both a 38{\deg} directional shift and a twofold increase in amplitude. Moreover, the Hall magnetic field is bipolar in the EDR but quadrupolar in the IDR, indicating different Hall current structures at electron and ion scales. These observations highlight the importance of three-dimensional effects and illustrate the complexity of multiscale coupling between the EDR and IDR during reconnection studies.1</description>

      <title>Rotation Periods of Candidate Single Late-M Dwarfs in TESS</title>

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the angular momentum evolution of late-M and brown dwarfs differs from the well-known spin-down evolution of hotter stars. Characterizing the distribution of rotation periods of these objects in the solar neighborhood can help elucidate this evolutionary pathway just above, at, and below the hydrogen burning limit. In this paper, we examine 399 candidate single late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \geq 1.4$ mag ($\gtrsim$M6) using TESS light curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle Periodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with a Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when available. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and amplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability fraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors, approaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit determined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced variability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our comparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we found consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings expand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%. Combined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types, we find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at early-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. With incorporated eleven-grid interpolation technique MARFA shows good performance in computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about $5*10E-4$ cm$^{-1}$, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>The visibility of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model in LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a new probabilistic technique for sampling interstellar object (ISO) orbits with high efficiency, we assess the observability of ISOs under a realistic cadence for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using the \={O}tautahi-Oxford population model, we show that there will be complex on-sky structure in the pattern of direction and velocity revealed by the detected ISO population, with the expected enhanced northern flux complicating efforts to derive population parameters from the LSST's predominately southern footprint. For luminosity functions with slopes of $2.5\leq q_s\leq 4.0$, the most discoverable ISOs have $H_r\simeq 14.6-20.7$; for previously estimated spatial densities, between 6 and 51 total ISOs are expected. The slope of the luminosity function of ISOs will be relatively quickly constrained. Discoveries are evenly split around their perihelion passage and are biased to lower velocities. After their discovery by LSST, it will be rare for ISOs to be visible for less than a month; most will have $m_r \leq 23$ for months, and the window for spectroscopic characterization could be as long as two years. These probabilistic assessments are robust against model or spatial density refinements that change the absolute numbers of ISO discoveries.</description>
