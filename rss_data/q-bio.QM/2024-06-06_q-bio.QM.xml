      <title>MoFormer: Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Generation Based on Conditional Transformer Joint Multi-modal Fusion Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning holds a big promise for optimizing existing peptides with more desirable properties, a critical step towards accelerating new drug discovery. Despite the recent emergence of several optimized Antimicrobial peptides(AMP) generation methods, multi-objective optimizations remain still quite challenging for the idealism-realism tradeoff. Here, we establish a multi-objective AMP synthesis pipeline (MoFormer) for the simultaneous optimization of multi-attributes of AMPs. MoFormer improves the desired attributes of AMP sequences in a highly structured latent space, guided by conditional constraints and fine-grained multi-descriptor.We show that MoFormer outperforms existing methods in the generation task of enhanced antimicrobial activity and minimal hemolysis. We also utilize a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting algorithm and proxies based on large model fine-tuning to hierarchically rank the candidates. We demonstrate substantial property improvement using MoFormer from two perspectives: (1) employing molecular simulations and scoring interactions among amino acids to decipher the structure and functionality of AMPs; (2) visualizing latent space to examine the qualities and distribution features, verifying an effective means to facilitate multi-objective optimization AMPs with design constraints</description>

      <title>Immunocto: a massive immune cell database auto-generated for histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of novel cancer treatment options such as immunotherapy, studying the tumour immune micro-environment is crucial to inform on prognosis and understand response to therapeutic agents. A key approach to characterising the tumour immune micro-environment may be through combining (1) digitised microscopic high-resolution optical images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue sections obtained in routine histopathology examinations with (2) automated immune cell detection and classification methods. However, current individual immune cell classification models for digital pathology present relatively poor performance. This is mainly due to the limited size of currently available datasets of individual immune cells, a consequence of the time-consuming and difficult problem of manually annotating immune cells on digitised H&amp;E whole slide images. In that context, we introduce Immunocto, a massive, multi-million automatically generated database of 6,848,454 human cells, including 2,282,818 immune cells distributed across 4 subtypes: CD4$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, CD8$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, B cell lymphocytes, and macrophages. For each cell, we provide a 64$\times$64 pixels H&amp;E image at $\mathbf{40}\times$ magnification, along with a binary mask of the nucleus and a label. To create Immunocto, we combined open-source models and data to automatically generate the majority of contours and labels. The cells are obtained from a matched H&amp;E and immunofluorescence colorectal dataset from the Orion platform, while contours are obtained using the Segment Anything Model. A classifier trained on H&amp;E images from Immunocto produces an average F1 score of 0.74 to differentiate the 4 immune cell subtypes and other cells.

      <title>Modeling PROTAC Degradation Activity with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PROTACs are a promising therapeutic modality that harnesses the cell's built-in degradation machinery to degrade specific proteins. Despite their potential, developing new PROTACs is challenging and requires significant domain expertise, time, and cost. Meanwhile, machine learning has transformed drug design and development. In this work, we present a strategy for curating open-source PROTAC data and an open-source deep learning tool for predicting the degradation activity of novel PROTAC molecules. The curated dataset incorporates important information such as $pDC_{50}$, $D_{max}$, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. Our model architecture leverages learned embeddings from pretrained machine learning models, in particular for encoding protein sequences and cell type information. We assessed the quality of the curated data and the generalization ability of our model architecture against new PROTACs and targets via three tailored studies, which we recommend other researchers to use in evaluating their degradation activity models. In each study, three models predict protein degradation in a majority vote setting, reaching a top test accuracy of 82.6% and 0.848 ROC AUC, and a test accuracy of 61% and 0.615 ROC AUC when generalizing to novel protein targets. Our results are not only comparable to state-of-the-art models for protein degradation prediction, but also part of an open-source implementation which is easily reproducible and less computationally complex than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Methods for Assessing the Accuracy of Pre-Planned and Guided Surgical Osteotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fibula-free flap (FFF) is a valuable reconstructive technique in maxillofacial surgery; however, the assessment of osteotomy accuracy remains challenging. We devised two novel methodologies to compare planned and postoperative osteotomies in FFF reconstructions that minimized user input but would still generalize to other operations involving the analysis of osteotomies. Our approaches leverage basic mathematics to derive both quantitative and qualitative insights about the relationship of the postoperative osteotomy to the planned model. We have coined our methods 'analysis by a shared reference angle' and 'Euler angle analysis'. In addition to describing our algorithm and the clinical utility, we present a thorough validation of both methods. Code is available at https://github.com/monkeygobah/osteoplane.</description>

      <title>Identification of PK-PD Insulin Models using Experimental GIR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to estimate parameters in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models for glucose insulin dynamics in humans. The method combines 1) experimental glucose infusion rate (GIR) data from glucose clamp studies and 2) a PK-PD model to estimate parameters such that the model fits the data. Assuming that the glucose clamp is perfect, we do not need to know the details of the controller in the clamp, and the GIR can be computed directly from the PK-PD model. To illustrate the procedure, we use the glucoregulatory model developed by Hovorka and modify it to have a smooth non-negative endogeneous glucose production (EGP) term. We estimate PK-PD parameters for rapid-acting insulin analogs (Fiasp and NovoRapid). We use these PK-PD parameters to illustrate GIR for insulin analogs with 30% and 50% faster absorption time than currently available rapid-acting insulin analogs. We discuss the role of system identification using GIR data from glucose clamp studies and how such identified models can be used in automated insulin dosing (AID) systems with ultra rapid-acting insulin.</description>

      <title>Complex hemodynamic responses to trans-vascular electrical stimulation of the renal nerve in anesthetized pigs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study was to characterize hemodynamic changes during trans-vascular stimulation of the renal nerve and their dependence on stimulation parameters. We employed a stimulation catheter inserted in the right renal artery under fluoroscopic guidance, in pigs. Systolic, diastolic and pulse blood pressure and heart rate were recorded during stimulations delivered at different intravascular sites along the renal artery or while varying stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, and pulse width). Blood pressure changes during stimulation displayed a pattern more complex than previously described in literature, with a series of negative and positive peaks over the first two minutes, followed by a steady state elevation during the remainder of the stimulation. Pulse pressure and heart rate only showed transient responses, then they returned to baseline values despite constant stimulation. The amplitude of the evoked hemodynamic response was roughly linearly correlated with stimulation amplitude, frequency, and pulse width.</description>

      <title>EpidermaQuant: Unsupervised detection and quantification of epidermal differentiation markers on H-DAB-stained images of reconstructed human epidermis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrity of the reconstructed human epidermis generated in vitro could be assessed using histological analyses combined with immunohistochemical staining of keratinocyte differentiation markers. Computer-based analysis of scanned tissue saves the expert time and may improve the accuracy of quantification by eliminating interrater reliability issues. However, technical differences during the preparation and capture of stained images and the presence of multiple artifacts may influence the outcome of computational methods. Using a dataset with 598 unannotated images showing cross-sections of in vitro reconstructed human epidermis stained with DAB-based immunohistochemistry reaction to visualize 4 different keratinocyte differentiation marker proteins (filaggrin, keratin 10, Ki67, HSPA2) and counterstained with hematoxylin, we developed an unsupervised method for the detection and quantification of immunohistochemical staining. The proposed pipeline includes the following steps: (i) color normalization to reduce the variability of pixel intensity values in different samples; (ii) color deconvolution to acquire color channels of the stains used; (iii) morphological operations to find the background area of the image; (iv) automatic image rotation; and (v) finding markers of human epidermal differentiation with clustering. Also, we created a method to exclude images without DAB-stained areas. The most effective combination of methods includes: (i) Reinhard's normalization; (ii) Ruifrok and Johnston color deconvolution method; (iii) proposed image rotation method based on boundary distribution of image intensity; (iv) k-means clustering using DAB stain intensity. These results should enhance the performance of quantitative analysis of protein markers in reconstructed human epidermis samples and enable comparison of their spatial distribution between different experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Inferring the time-varying coupling of dynamical systems with temporal convolutional autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most approaches for assessing causality in complex dynamical systems fail when the interactions between variables are inherently non-linear and non-stationary. Here we introduce Temporal Autoencoders for Causal Inference (TACI), a methodology that combines a new surrogate data metric for assessing causal interactions with a novel two-headed machine learning architecture to identify and measure the direction and strength of time-varying causal interactions. Through tests on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate TACI's ability to accurately quantify dynamic causal interactions across a variety of systems. Our findings display the method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches and also highlight our approach's potential to build a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie time-varying interactions in physical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Structure-based Drug Design Benchmark: Do 3D Methods Really Dominate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of sixteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. The empirical results show that 1D/2D methods achieve competitive performance compared with 3D-based methods that use the 3D structure of the target protein explicitly. Also, AutoGrow4, a 2D molecular graph-based genetic algorithm, dominates SBDD in terms of optimization ability. The relevant code is available in https://github.com/zkysfls/2024-sbdd-benchmark.</description>

      <title>LncRNA-disease association prediction method based on heterogeneous information completion and convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging research shows that lncRNA has crucial research value in a series of complex human diseases. Therefore, the accurate identification of lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) is very important for the warning and treatment of diseases. However, most of the existing methods have limitations in identifying nonlinear LDAs, and it remains a huge challenge to predict new LDAs. In this paper, a deep learning model based on a heterogeneous network and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for lncRNA-disease association prediction, named HCNNLDA. The heterogeneous network containing the lncRNA, disease, and miRNA nodes, is constructed firstly. The embedding matrix of a lncRNA-disease node pair is constructed according to various biological premises about lncRNAs, diseases, and miRNAs. Then, the low-dimensional feature representation is fully learned by the convolutional neural network. In the end, the XGBoot classifier model is trained to predict the potential LDAs. HCNNLDA obtains a high AUC value of 0.9752 and AUPR of 0.9740 under the 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the proposed model has better performance than that of several latest prediction models. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of HCNNLDA in identifying novel LDAs is further demonstrated by case studies of three diseases. To sum up, HCNNLDA is a feasible calculation model to predict LDAs.</description>

      <title>Scientific Hypothesis Generation by a Large Language Model: Laboratory Validation in Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI and achieved breakthrough performance on a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence. In science, perhaps the most interesting application of LLMs is for hypothesis formation. A feature of LLMs, which results from their probabilistic structure, is that the output text is not necessarily a valid inference from the training text. These are 'hallucinations', and are a serious problem in many applications. However, in science, hallucinations may be useful: they are novel hypotheses whose validity may be tested by laboratory experiments. Here we experimentally test the use of LLMs as a source of scientific hypotheses using the domain of breast cancer treatment. We applied the LLM GPT4 to hypothesize novel pairs of FDA-approved non-cancer drugs that target the MCF7 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A. In the first round of laboratory experiments GPT4 succeeded in discovering three drug combinations (out of 12 tested) with synergy scores above the positive controls. These combinations were itraconazole + atenolol, disulfiram + simvastatin and dipyridamole + mebendazole. GPT4 was then asked to generate new combinations after considering its initial results. It then discovered three more combinations with positive synergy scores (out of four tested), these were disulfiram + fulvestrant, mebendazole + quinacrine and disulfiram + quinacrine. A limitation of GPT4 as a generator of hypotheses was that its explanations for them were formulaic and unconvincing. We conclude that LLMs are an exciting novel source of scientific hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of deep learning techniques on aroma-chemicals has resulted in models more accurate than human experts at predicting olfactory qualities. However, public research in this domain has been limited to predicting the qualities of single molecules, whereas in industry applications, perfumers and food scientists are often concerned with blends of many molecules. In this paper, we apply both existing and novel approaches to a dataset we gathered consisting of labeled pairs of molecules. We present graph neural network models capable of accurately predicting the odor qualities arising from blends of aroma-chemicals, with an analysis of how variations in architecture can lead to significant differences in predictive power.</description>
