      <title>Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\"ive solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.</description>

      <title>Modellierung und Simulation der Dynamik von Fussg\"angerstr\"omen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a microscopic model to describe pedestrian flows based on the social force theory. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) developing a realistic model that can be used as a tool for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verifying a social science theory using a model with sufficient data. The investigation of the pedestrian model shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns, complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through the interactions in pedestrian flows. Collective behavior emerges from individuals following two basic rules: (1) moving directly towards their goal at a certain speed, and (2) maintaining a distance to other pedestrians and obstacles. This self-organized collective behavior manifests itself as trails that are formed by pedestrians moving in one direction. Furthermore, strong dependencies of the properties of pedestrian flows on geometric forms of buildings are shown, and the influence of geometric changes on performance characteristics is investigated. An example demonstrates how efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas. This work also presents an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing building layouts based on the social force model. Additionally, a decision-making model is integrated to describe alternative goal selection, and adaptation and learning capabilities are included to improve pedestrian avoidance behavior and decision strategies based on accumulated experience. A method for determining load distributions in individual sections of a path system considering subjective selection criteria is also developed. Finally, a model that describes the self-organization of path systems with minimal detours is presented, similar to natural transport networks where total length and material costs are optimized.</description>

      <title>Permission Manifests for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents represents a significant shift in automated interactions with the web. Unlike traditional crawlers that follow simple conventions, such as robots.txt, modern agents engage with websites in sophisticated ways: navigating complex interfaces, extracting structured information, and completing end-to-end tasks. Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions.json, a robots.txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots.txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Algorithms for Computing Nash Equilibria in Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonzero sum games are widely used to model multi agent decision making in control, economics, and related fields. Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme. Both approaches search directly over joint strategy spaces without restrictive assumptions and are less prone to getting trapped in local Nash equilibria, providing more reliable approximations to global Nash solutions.</description>

      <title>EvoRoute: Experience-Driven Self-Routing LLM Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex agentic AI systems, powered by a coordinated ensemble of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool and memory modules, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on intricate, multi-turn tasks. However, this success is shadowed by prohibitive economic costs and severe latency, exposing a critical, yet underexplored, trade-off. We formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\%$ and latency by over $70\%$.</description>

      <title>Image, Word and Thought: A More Challenging Language Task for the Iterated Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model simulates the transmission of language from generation to generation in order to explore how the constraints imposed by language transmission facilitate the emergence of language structure. Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.</description>

      <title>MixTTE: Multi-Level Mixture-of-Experts for Scalable and Adaptive Travel Time Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.</description>

      <title>ReCCur: A Recursive Corner-Case Curation Framework for Robust Vision-Language Understanding in Open and Edge Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Localized Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Design Spaces using Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-scale agent-based simulations of the opioid epidemic help evaluate intervention strategies and overdose outcomes in heterogeneous communities and provide estimates of localized treatment effects, which support the design of locally-tailored policies for precision public health. However, it is prohibitively costly to run simulations of all treatment conditions in all communities because the number of possible treatments grows exponentially with the number of interventions and levels at which they are applied. To address this need efficiently, we develop a metamodel framework, whereby treatment outcomes are modeled using a response function whose coefficients are learned through Gaussian process regression (GPR) on locally-contextualized covariates. We apply this framework to efficiently estimate treatment effects on overdose deaths in Pennsylvania counties. In contrast to classical designs such as fractional factorial design or Latin hypercube sampling, our approach leverages spatial correlations and posterior uncertainty to sequentially sample the most informative counties and treatment conditions. Using a calibrated agent-based opioid epidemic model, informed by county-level overdose mortality and baseline dispensing rate data for different treatments, we obtained county-level estimates of treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 population for all treatment conditions in Pennsylvania, achieving approximately 5% average relative error using one-tenth the number of simulation runs required for exhaustive evaluation. Our bi-level framework provides a computationally efficient approach to decision support for policy makers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource-allocation strategies to mitigate the opioid epidemic in local communities. The same analytical framework can be applied to guide precision public health interventions in other epidemic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent LLM pipelines grow in complexity, existing serving paradigms fail to adapt to the dynamic serving conditions. We argue that agentic serving systems should be programmable and system-aware, unlike existing serving which statically encode the parameters. In this work, we propose a new SDN-inspired agentic serving framework that helps control the key attributes of communication based on runtime state. This architecture enables serving-efficient, responsive agent systems and paves the way for high-level intent-driven agentic serving.</description>

      <title>InfiAgent: An Infinite-Horizon Framework for General-Purpose Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based current calculation model to achieve power-optimal magnetic-field interaction for multi-agent formation and attitude control. In aerospace engineering, electromagnetic coils are referred to as magnetorquer (MTQ) coils and used as satellite attitude actuators in Earth's orbit and for long-term formation and attitude control. This study derives a unique, continuous, and power-optimal current solution via sequential convex programming and approximates it using a multilayer perceptron model. The effectiveness of our strategy was demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental trials on the formation and attitude control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be deployed in situations where they process positive/negative interactions with other agents. We study how this is done under the sociological framework of social balance, which explains the emergence of one faction or multiple antagonistic ones among agents. Across different LLM models, we find that balance depends on the (i) type of interaction, (ii) update mechanism, and (iii) population size. Across (i)-(iii), we characterize the frequency at which social balance is achieved, the justifications for the social dynamics, and the diversity and stability of interactions. Finally, we explain how our findings inform the deployment of agentic systems.</description>

      <title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic notion of \emph{truthfulness} requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for \emph{some} combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \emph{risky} -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as \emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent can gain from a \emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the \emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and two-sided matching.</description>

      <title>Scene-Aware Vectorized Memory Multi-Agent Framework with Cross-Modal Differentiated Quantization VLMs for Visually Impaired Assistance</title>

Abstract: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in environmental perception. Traditional assistive technologies often lack adaptive intelligence, focusing on individual components rather than integrated systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to richer, integrated understanding, their deployment is severely limited by substantial computational requirements, demanding dozens of gigabytes of memory. To address these gaps in computational efficiency and integrated design, this study proposes a dual technological innovation framework: a cross-modal differentiated quantization framework for VLMs and a scene-aware vectorized memory multi-agent system. The quantization framework implements differentiated strategies, reducing memory from 38GB to 11.3GB. The multi-agent system uses vectorized memory and perception-memory-reasoning workflows to provide environmental information beyond the current view, achieving 2.83-3.52s latency to initial speech output. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering comprehensive assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</description>

      <title>AgentArch: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate Agent Architectures in Enterprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</description>

      <title>When Identity Skews Debate: Anonymization for Bias-Reduced Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517</link>

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias and improving trustworthiness. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled bias metric that measures an agent's tendency to follow its peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than identity. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.</description>

      <title>SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.
