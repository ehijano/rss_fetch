      <title>Structural Properties of the Geometric Preferential Attachment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes key properties of networks generated by geometric preferential attachment. We establish that the expected number of triangles is proportional to that of the standard preferential attachment model, with a proportionality constant equal to the ratio of the number of triangles between a random geometric graph and an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph. Furthermore, we prove that the maximum degree grows polynomially with the network size, sharing the same exponent as the standard model; however, the spatial constraint induces a slower growth rate in the network's early evolution. Finally, we extend prior results on connectivity and diameter to the case of networks with finite out-degrees.</description>

      <title>Classical localization problem: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey classical localization problems arising from quantum network models in symmetry class C and their mappings to history-dependent random walks on directed lattices. We describe how localization versus delocalization of trajectories can be analysed using percolation methods and combinatorial enumeration of path intersection patterns. In particular, we review results establishing almost sure finiteness of trajectories for parameters near criticality and polynomial bounds on the confinement length in cylindrical geometries.</description>

      <title>The Mixed Birth-death/death-Birth Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\lambda$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\lambda=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\lambda=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are "almost regular," in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r&gt;1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\Omega_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\{d_1, d_2\}$ with $d_1 \leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\lambda$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \alpha^4)$ for all $\lambda$, where $\alpha = d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>The persistent homology of the Linial-Meshulam process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed dimension $k\ge 1$, let us consider the randomly growing simplical complex on the vertex set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ defined as follows: We start with the empty complex, and for each $k+1$-element subset $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we add $\sigma$ and all of its subsets to the complex at some random time $t_\sigma$, where $(t_\sigma)$ are i.i.d. uniform random elements of $[0,n]$. As the complex evolves, new $k-1$-dimensional cycles are born and then at a later time they die, that is, they get filled in. The notion of persistence diagrams, which is a standard tool in topological data analysis, provides a way to record these birth and death times. In this paper, we understand the asymptotic behavior of the persistence diagrams of the above defined randomly evolving complexes as $n$ goes to infinity.
  As the single time marginals of the above process are variants of the Linial-Meshulam complex, our results can be viewed as extensions of the results of Linial and Peled on the Betti numbers of the Linial-Meshulam complex.
  Our proof relies on the notion of local weak convergence of graphs and a generalization of the results of Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez on the rank of sparse random matrices.</description>

      <title>Overlap distribution of spherical spin glass models with general eigenvalue distribution of the interaction matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the replica symmetry of the Gibbs measure of spherical spin systems is a property of the eigenvalue spacing at the edge of the interaction matrix. In particular, our interaction matrix has \textbf{two} large outlier eigenvalues with mutual distance $\frac{c}{n}$. The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model. In our limited understanding, we believe that this kind of phenomenon cannot be explained by the Parisi approach.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to soft and hard edge universality for random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to universality of local scaling limits for eigenvalues of random normal matrices, or equivalently for planar Coulomb gases at inverse temperature $\beta=2$. The approach is direct in that it does not rely on expressing the kernels in terms of orthogonal polynomials. There are three main results. The first is a proof of universality at hard edges with no symmetry assumptions on either the potential or the hard edge. We also prove local universality at regular soft edges for droplets with several components, and lastly for soft/hard edges where a hard edge perfectly aligns with the droplet boundary. The main ingredients are Paley-Wiener type spectral embeddings for the Hilbert space associated with a limiting kernel, and the construction of weighted polynomials peaking near a given boundary point.</description>

      <title>Correlation Decay for Maximum Weight Matchings on Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation decay for the maximum weight matching problem on sparse graphs with i.i.d. edge weights. We show exponential decay of correlations when the underlying graphs are locally tree-like with uniformly bounded degree and the edge weights are exponential. We also prove a polynomial rate of decay of correlations for any finite graph with maximum degree at most three, again for exponential edge weights. As consequences of the correlation decay property, we obtain the existence of the maximum weight matching on infinite graphs, local weak convergence of the maximum weight matching, and a law of large numbers for its total weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expansion of the limiting free energy density of the random field Ising chain with centered IID disorder and homogeneous coupling parameter, when the latter goes to infinity. We extend the first order result of [Collin, 2025] to the general case of finite second moment. Furthermore, we identify the value of the unknown constant appearing in the main theorem of [Collin, Giacomin, Greenblatt, Hu, 2025], which is the first non-universal constant in the expansion of the limiting free energy density.</description>

      <title>Geometric Rough Paths above Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive theory of geometric rough paths for mixed fractional Brownian motion (MFBM) and its generalized multi-component extensions. We prove that for a generalized MFBM of the form $M_t^H(a) = \sum_{k=1}^N a_k B_t^{H_k}$ with $\min\{H_k\} &gt; \frac{1}{4}$, there exists a canonical geometric rough path obtained as the limit of smooth rough paths associated with dyadic approximations. This extends the classical result of Coutin and Qian \cite{coutin2002} for single fractional Brownian motion to the mixed case.
  We provide explicit bounds on the $p$-variation norms and establish a Skorohod integral representation connecting our pathwise construction to the Malliavin calculus framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications to rough differential equations driven by MFBM, enabling the use of Lyons' universal limit theorem for this class of processes. Finally, we study the signature of MFBM paths, providing a complete algebraic characterization of their geometric properties.
  Our approach unifies the treatment of multiple fractional components and reveals the fundamental interactions between different regularity scales, completing the rough path foundation for mixed fractional processes with applications in stochastic analysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>On The Eigenvalue Rigidity of the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an optimal global rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues of the Jacobi unitary ensemble. Our approach begins by constructing a random measure defined through the eigenvalue counting function. We then prove its convergence to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure, which leads to the desired rigidity result. To establish this convergence, we apply a sufficient condition from Claeys et al. \cite{CFL2021} and conduct an asymptotic analysis of the related exponential moments.</description>

      <title>A modified Consensus-Based Optimization model: consensus formation and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Consensus-Based Optimization model that admits a fully unified and rigorous analysis of its finite-particle dynamics, the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, and their optimization behavior under a single set of structural framework. The key ingredient is a regularized Gibbs weight that stabilizes the consensus point and avoids degeneracies present in the classical formulation, eliminating the need for cutoffs, rescaling, or boundedness assumptions on the objective function. Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights. Together, these results yield a unified and internally consistent theoretical framework for consensus-based optimization under substantially relaxed regularity assumptions on the objective function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates neutral-type McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations in which the drift and diffusion coefficients depend on both the segment process and its distribution. Under a one-sided Lipschitz condition on the drift coefficient, we establish a Freidlin-Wentzell-type large deviation principle for the solution process by using the extended contraction principle combined with an exponential approximation technique. Our results extend existing large deviation principles for McKean-Vlasov equations to the neutral case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the laws of the BPHZ random models satisfy some transportation cost inequalities in the full subcritical regime if there is no variance blowup and the law of the noise is translation invariant and satisfies some transportation cost inequality. As a consequence, the laws of a number of solutions to some singular stochastic partial differential equations also satisfy some transportation cost inequalities. This is in particular the case of the $\Phi^4_{4-\delta}$ measures over the 4-dimensional torus, for all $0&lt;\delta&lt;4$.</description>

      <title>The Maki-Thompson Model with Spontaneous Stifling on Symmetric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate rumor spreading in a generalized Maki-Thompson model with spontaneous stifling, evolving on quasi-transitive networks. Individuals are either ignorants, spreaders, or stiflers; spreaders stop by contact with other spreaders or stiflers or after an independent random waiting time sampled from a given distribution, modeling a spontaneous loss of interest. The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states. The mean-field limit is described by a system of nonlinear integral equations, while fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian and governed by a system of stochastic integral equations with explicit covariance. Our results show how the topology and the law of spontaneous stifling jointly shape the speed and variability of rumor outbreaks. As a special case, our model reduces to the classical Maki-Thompson model when spontaneous stifling is absent.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling limits at the spectral singularity of structured random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical spectral distribution of Hermitian $K \times K$-block random matrices converges to a deterministic density on the real line with a potential atom at the origin as the dimension of the blocks tends to infinity. In this model the variances of the entries depends on the block and the limiting density is determined by these variances. In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity. The scaling limits depend only on the zero pattern within the variance profile, but not on the values of its positive entries.</description>

Abstract: We prove that under the heat semigroup $(P_\tau)$ on the Boolean hypercube, any nonnegative function $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}_+$ exhibits a uniform tail bound that is better than that by Markov's inequality. Specifically, for any $\eta &gt; e^3$ and $\tau &gt; 0$,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}_{X \sim \mu}\left( P_\tau f(X) &gt; \eta \int f d\mu \right) \leq c_\tau \frac{ \log \log \eta }{\eta \sqrt{\log \eta}},
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu$ is the uniform measure on the Boolean hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ and $c_\tau$ is a constant that only depends on $\tau$. This resolves Talagrand's convolution conjecture up to a dimension-free $\log\log \eta$ factor. Its proof relies on properties of the reverse heat process on the Boolean hypercube and a coupling construction based on carefully engineered perturbations of this reverse heat process.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for supercritical Crump-Mode-Jagers processes counted with non-individual random characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a supercritical Crump-Mode-Jagers process $(\mathcal{Z}_{t}^{\varphi})_{t \geq 0}$ counted with a random characteristic $\varphi$ that depends on an individual's life and their descendant process up to a fixed generation. Under second moment assumptions, we establish a central limit theorem for $\mathcal{Z}_{t}^{\varphi}$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Our result extends the recent work of Iksanov, Kolesko, and Meiners (2024) by relaxing their assumption of independent characteristics across individuals. We further demonstrate the applicability of our results to the study of fringe trees in several important random tree families, thereby providing insights into questions raised by Holmgren and Janson (2017).</description>

      <title>Chernoff-Mehler Approximation for L\'evy Processes with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an approximation scheme for L\'evy processes with drift in terms of a representation that is akin to the celebrated Mehler formula for L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The approximation scheme is based on a variant of the Chernoff product formula on the space of bounded continuous functions. In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the L\'evy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a L\'evy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework.</description>

      <title>Comparing Labeled Markov Chains: A Cantor-Kantorovich Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Labeled Markov Chains (or LMCs for short) are useful mathematical objects to model complex probabilistic languages. A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a Family of Painlev\'e Functions with Applications to CUE Derivative Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlev\'e functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math. Physics. 2(2021), 613-642, Remark 2.5] concerning the existence of a probability density for a random variable arising in the ergodic decomposition of Hua-Pickrell measures.</description>

      <title>Superhedging under Proportional Transaction Costs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the well-studied superhedging problem under proportional transaction costs in continuous time using the recently developed tools of set-valued stochastic analysis. By relying on a simple Black-Scholes-type market model for mid-prices and using continuous trading schemes, we define a dynamic family of superhedging sets in continuous time and express them in terms of set-valued integrals. We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets.</description>

      <title>Variations of the Hardy Z-Function and the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</description>

We first prove the convergence of solutions for system driven by alpha-stable Levy noise to those of the system driven by Brownian motion.

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control of heterogeneous mean-field stochastic differential equations with common noise has not been addressed in the literature. In this work, we initiate the study of such models. We formulate the problem within a linear-quadratic framework, a particularly important class in control theory, typically renowned for its analytical tractability and broad range of applications. We derive a novel system of backward stochastic Riccati equations on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As this system is not covered by standard theory, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions. We explicitly characterize the optimal control in term of the solution of such system. We apply these results to solve two problems arising in mathematical finance: optimal trading with heterogeneous market participants and systemic risk in networks of heterogeneous banks.</description>

      <title>Overlap Analysis of the Shortest Path Problem: Local Search, Landscapes, and Franz--Parisi Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two directions in algorithms and complexity involve: (1) classifying which optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, and (2) understanding which computational problems are hard to solve \emph{on average} in addition to the worst case. For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms.
  Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \emph{Gibbs measures} and the \emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input.
  A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lov\'asz extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails.</description>

      <title>Resolving Node Identifiability in Graph Neural Processes via Laplacian Spectral Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.</description>

      <title>On the Tail Transition of First Arrival Position Channels: From Cauchy to Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the zero-drift First Arrival Position (FAP) channel is rigorously known to be Cauchy-distributed, practical molecular communication systems typically operate with non-zero drift. This letter characterizes the transition from heavy-tailed Cauchy behavior to light-tailed exponential decay. Through asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical spatial scale $n_c=\sigma^2/v$ separating diffusion- and drift-dominated regimes, revealing that the channel effectively behaves as a ``Truncated Cauchy'' model. Numerical results show that Gaussian approximations severely underestimate capacity at low drift, while the zero-drift case provides the appropriate performance lower bound for systems where drift assists particle transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.08473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mossel and Ross (2019) introduce the shotgun assembly problem for random graphs: what radius $R$ ensures that the random graph $G$ can be uniquely recovered from its list of rooted $R$-neighborhoods, with high probability? Here we consider this question for random regular graphs of fixed degree $d\ge3$. A result of Bollob\'as (1982) implies efficient recovery at $R = (1 + \epsilon) \frac12 \log_{d-1}n$ with high probability -- moreover, this recovery algorithm uses only a summary of the distances in each neighborhood. We show that using the full neighborhood structure gives a sharper bound \[
  R = \frac{\log n + \log\log n}{2\log(d-1)} + O(1)\,, \] which we prove is tight up to the $O(1)$ term. One consequence of our proof is that if $G,H$ are independent graphs where $G$ follows the random regular law, then with high probability the graphs are non-isomorphic; furthermore, this can be efficiently certified by testing the $R$-neighborhood list of $H$ against the $R$-neighborhood of a single adversarially chosen vertex of $G$.</description>

Abstract: Contraction properties of transport maps between probability measures play an important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new transport map, based on the F\"ollmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous questions for optimal transport maps are open.
  The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits conjecture.
  We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal transport maps (which are related to Brownian transport maps) between the Wiener measure and other target measures on Wiener space exhibit very different behaviors.</description>

For (semi)-log-concave measures and Gaussian mixtures, our bounds have several applications: eigenvalues comparisons, dimensional functional inequalities, and domination of distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Non-linear conductances of Galton-Watson trees and application to the (near) critical random cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study concave recursions on trees, which appear widely in information theory through algorithms such as belief propagation, and in statistical mechanics through models on tree-like graphs, including the Ising model, percolation, and more generally, the random cluster model. These tree recursions can, in fact, be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton--Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p&gt;1$, for a quenched realization of $T_n$. In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on $T_n$ (with cluster weight parameter in $(0,2]$ and wired boundary condition) providing sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite third moment; (ii) $n^{-1/(\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\alpha \in (1,3)$.</description>

      <title>Total variation distance between SDEs with stable noise and Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form $d U_t = b(U_t) dt + \sigma\,d Z_t$, let $X_t$ be the solution if the driving noise $Z_t$ is a $d$-dimensional rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable process ($1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$), and let $Y_t$ be the solution if the driving noise is a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion.
  Continuing the work of [Deng,Schilling, Xu, Bernoulli, 23], we derive an estimate of the total variation distance $\|{\rm L} (X_{t})-{\rm law}(Y_{t})\|_{\rm TV}$ for all $t&gt;0$, and we show that the ergodic measures $\mu_\alpha$ and $\mu_2$ of $X_t$ and $Y_t$, respectively, satisfy $$\|\mu_\alpha-\mu_2\|_{\rm TV} \leq \frac{Cd\log(1+d)}{\alpha-1}(2-\alpha).$$ We shall show that this bound is optimal with respect to $\alpha$ by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck SDE. Combining this bound with a recent interpolation result from \cite{HRW23}, we can derive a bound in Wasserstein-$p$ distance ($0&lt; p &lt;1$): \begin{gather*}
  \|\mu_\alpha-\mu_2\|_{W_p} \leq\frac{Cd^{(p+3)/2}\log(1+d)}{\alpha-1} (2-\alpha). \end{gather*} {\bf Key Words:} Total variation distance, Wasserstein-$p$ distance, stochastic differential equation, Poisson equation, stable process.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Boolean percolation on graphs of bounded degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of long-range site percolation on graphs of bounded degree, namely the Boolean percolation model. In this model, each vertex of an infinite connected graph is the center of a ball of random radius, and vertices are said to be active independently with probability $p \in [0, 1]$. We consider $W$ to be the reunion of random balls with an active center. In certain circumstances, the model does not exhibit a phase transition, in the sense that $W$ almost surely contains an infinite component for all $p &gt; 0$, or even $W$ covers the entire graph. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition on the radius distribution for the existence of a subcritical phase, namely a regime such that almost surely all the connected components of $W$ are finite. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the exponential decay of the size of a typical component.</description>

      <title>Inverting the Markovian projection for pure jump processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markovian projections arise in problems where we aim to mimic the one-dimensional marginal laws of an It\^o semimartingale by using another It\^o process with Markovian dynamics. In applications, Markovian projections are useful in calibrating jump-diffusion models with both local and stochastic features, leading to the study of the inversion problems. In this paper, we invert the Markovian projections for pure jump processes, which can be used to construct calibrated local stochastic intensity (LSI) models for credit risk applications. Such models are jump process analogues of the notoriously hard to construct local stochastic volatility (LSV) models used in equity modeling.</description>

Abstract: The functional characterization of a measure, an essential but delicate
  aspect of Stein's method, is shown to be accessible for stable probability
  distributions on convex cones. This notion encompasses the usual stable
  distributions \textit{e.g.} Gaussian, Pareto, \textit{etc.} but also the
  max-stable distributions: Weibull, Gumbel and Fr\'echet. We use the definition
  of max-stability to define a Markov process whose invariant measure is the
  stable measure of interest. In this paper, we focus on the Gumbel
  distribution and show how this construction can be applied to estimate the
  rate of convergence in the classical coupon collector's problem.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a theory of stochastic integration for operator-valued processes with respect to semimartingales taking values in the dual of a nuclear space. Our construction of this particular stochastic integral relies on previous results from [Electron. J. Probab., Volume 26, paper no. 147, 2021], together with specific tools which share some common features with good integrators in finite dimensions. We investigate various properties of this stochastic integral together with applications. In particular we obtain approximations by Riemann sums results, and provide an alternative proof of \"{U}st\"{u}nel's version of It\^{o}'s formula involving of distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational tail bound for norms of random vectors under moment assumptions on their one-dimensional marginals. We also propose a simplified version of the bound that parametrizes the ``aggregating'' distribution in the proposed variational bound by considering a certain pushforward of the Gaussian distribution. We show that the proposed method reproduces some of the well-known bounds on norms of Gaussian random vectors, as well as a recent dimension-free concentration inequality for the spectral norm of sum of independent and identically distributed positive semidefinite matrices with sub-exponential marginals. We also obtain a similar concentration inequality for the sample covariance matrix of sub-exponential random vectors. Furthermore, we use coupling to formulate an abstraction of the proposed approach that applies more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scale-free percolation on a discrete torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N$. Conditionally on an i.i.d. sequence of Pareto weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{W_iW_j}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$.
  We focus on the (centred) Laplacian operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. We explicitly identify the limiting distribution when $\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tau&gt;3$, in terms of the spectral distribution of some non-commutative unbounded operators.</description>

Abstract: We consider deformed sparse random matrices of the form $H= W+ \lambda V$, where $W$ is a real symmetric sparse random matrix, $V$ is a random or deterministic, real, diagonal matrix whose entries are independent of $W$, and $\lambda = O(1) $ is a coupling constant. Under mild assumptions on the matrix entries of $W$ and $V$, we prove local laws for $H$ that compare the empirical spectral measure of it with a refined version of the deformed semicircle law. By applying the local laws, we also prove several spectral properties of $H$, including the rigidity of the eigenvalues and the asymptotic normality of the extremal eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharpness result for the dynamics of finite-range Interacting Particle Systems (IPS) on $\{0,1\}^{\Z^d}$, which generalizes to a whole class of IPS the sharpness result for the phase transition of the contact process obtained by Bezuidenhout and Grimmett~\cite{BezuidenhoutGrimmett1991}. More precisely, starting from an IPS that is monotone, ergodic, and which admits the all-zero configuration as an absorbing state, we prove that there exists an arbitrarily small perturbation of the dynamics which leads to an \emph{exponentially} ergodic IPS. This also extends the sharpness result previously established for (discrete-time) probabilistic cellular automata in \cite{Har} to the continuous-time setting of IPS.</description>

Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the convergence of their infinitesimal generators in the mixed topology, we provide a stability result for strongly continuous convex monotone semigroups on spaces of continuous functions. In contrast to previous results, we do not rely on the theory of viscosity solutions but use a recent comparison principle which uniquely determines the semigroup via its $\Gamma$-generator defined on the Lipschitz set and therefore resembles the classical analogue from the linear case. The framework also allows for discretizations both in time and space and covers a variety of applications. This includes Euler schemes and Yosida-type approximations for upper envelopes of families of linear semigroups, stability results and finite-difference schemes for convex HJB equations, Freidlin-Wentzell-type results and Markov chain approximations for a class of stochastic optimal control problems and continuous-time Markov processes with uncertain transition probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops some theory of the Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression. The theory developed for the correlated Dyson equation includes existence-uniqueness, spectral support bounds, and stability properties. This theory is new for constructing deterministic equivalents for pseudo-resolvents of a class of linearizations with correlated entries. In the application, this theory is used to give a deterministic equivalent of the test error in random features ridge regression, in a proportional scaling regime, wherein we have conditioned on both training and test datasets.</description>

      <title>Reviving pseudo-inverses: Asymptotic properties of large dimensional Moore-Penrose and Ridge-type inverses with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive high-dimensional asymptotic properties of the Moore-Penrose inverse and, as a byproduct, of various ridge-type inverses of the sample covariance matrix. In particular, the analytical expressions of the asymptotic behavior of the weighted sample trace moments of generalized inverse matrices are deduced in terms of the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can be easily computed in practice. The existent results for pseudo-inverses are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings provide universal methodology for construction of fully data-driven improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, optimal portfolio weights and beyond. It is found that the Moore-Penrose inverse acts asymptotically as a certain regularizer of the true covariance matrix and it seems that its proper transformation (shrinkage) performs similarly to or even outperforms the existing benchmarks in many applications, while keeping the computational time as minimal as possible.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Mixing of the Kawasaki Dynamics on Bounded-Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the worst-case mixing time of the global Kawasaki dynamics for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. Proving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that below the tree uniqueness threshold, the Kawasaki dynamics mix rapidly for all magnetizations. Disproving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that the regime of fast mixing does not extend throughout the regime of tractability for this model: there is a range of parameters for which there exist efficient sampling algorithms for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on max-degree $\Delta$ graphs, but the Kawasaki dynamics can take exponential time to mix. Our techniques involve showing spectral independence in the fixed-magnetization Ising model and proving a sharp threshold for the existence of multiple metastable states in the Ising model with external field on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with nonconstant diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce multilevel Picard (MLP) approximations for McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with nonconstant diffusion coefficient. Under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the coefficients, we show that the MLP algorithm approximates the solution of the SDE in the $L^2$-sense without the curse of dimensionality. The latter means that its computational cost grows at most polynomially in both the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed error tolerance. In two numerical experiments, we demonstrate its applicability by approximating McKean--Vlasov SDEs in dimensions up to 1000.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for Score-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework based on Malliavin calculus to derive exact analytical expressions for the score function $\nabla \log p_t(x)$, i.e., the gradient of the log-density associated with the solution to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our approach combines classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern stochastic analysis tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, and it works for both linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint, the Malliavin divergence (Skorokhod integral), and diffusion generative models, thereby providing a systematic method for computing $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. In the linear case, we present a detailed analysis showing that our formula coincides with the analytical score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation. For nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients, we derive a closed-form expression for $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. We evaluate the proposed framework across multiple generative tasks and find that its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These results can be generalised to broader classes of SDEs, paving the way for new score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian nonparametric community detection in assortative stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured data in the form of networks are increasingly common in a number of fields, including the social sciences, biology, physics, computer science, and many others. A key task in network analysis is community detection, which typically consists of dividing the nodes into groups such that nodes within a group are strongly connected, while connections between groups are relatively scarce. A generative model well suited for the formation of such communities is the assortative stochastic block model (SBM), which prescribes a higher probability of a connection between nodes belonging to the same block rather than to different blocks. A recent line of work has utilized Bayesian nonparametric methods to recover communities in the SBM by placing a prior distribution on the number of blocks and estimating block assignments via collapsed Gibbs samplers. However, efficiently incorporating the assortativity constraint through the prior remains an open problem. In this work, we address this gap by studying the effect of enforcing assortativity on Bayesian community detection and identifying the scenarios in which it pays dividends in comparison with standard SBM. We illustrate our findings through an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>Subelliptic Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds and Their Convergence to Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the convergence to equilibrium of an $(h,\rho)$-subelliptic random walk on a closed, connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ associated with a subelliptic second-order differential operator $A$ on $M$. In such a random walk, $h$ roughly represents the step size and $\rho$ the speed at which it is carried out. To construct the random walk and prove the convergence result, we employ a technique due to Fefferman and Phong, which reduces the problem to the study of a constant-coefficient operator $\tilde{A}$ that is locally equivalent to our second-order subelliptic operator $A$, in the sense that the diffusion generated by $\tilde{A}$ induces a local diffusion for $A$. By using the compactness of $M$ this local diffusion can be lifted to a global diffusion, and the convergence result is then obtained via the spectral theory of the associated Markov operator.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Models for Phase Retrieval with Optical Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to Fourier ptychography. In particular, the reconstruction is facilitated when the sensing matrix is i.i.d. random, enabling strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms. However, its applicability is restricted by excessive computational costs. In this paper, we propose structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We reduce the complexity from quadratic to log-linear at no cost in reconstruction performance. Through a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular-value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of High-dimensional Multivariate Kendall-$\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Kendall-$\tau$ statistic, denoted by $K_n$, plays a significant role in robust statistical analysis. This paper establishes the limiting properties of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $K_n$. We demonstrate that the ESD of $\frac{1}{2}pK_n$ converges almost surely to the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur law with variance parameter $\frac{1}{2}$, analogous to the classical result for sample covariance matrices. Using Stieltjes transform techniques, we extend these results to the independent component model, deriving a fixed-point equation that characterizes the limiting spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{2}tr\Sigma K_n$. The theoretical findings are validated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with $n$ nodes and $k$ edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring $\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)$ tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graphs $G\sim\mathrm{ER}(n,q)$ in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is $\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}$, and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ but incurs $\Omega(n^2)$ decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra $(\log \bar{k})(\log n)$ factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ tests while attaining decoding time $O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)$ for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$.</description>
