      <title>Impacts of Atmospheric Carbon Species and Stellar Type on Climates of Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The climates of terrestrial planets are largely determined by the composition of their atmospheres and spectral types of their host stars. Previous studies suggest a wide range of carbon species abundances (CO\textsubscript{2}, CO, and CH\textsubscript{4}) can result from variations in reducing fluxes and stellar spectral types which influence photochemistry. However, a systematic investigation of how varying carbon species, particularly CO, affect planetary climates across wide parameter spaces remains limited. Here, we employ a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model to examine the dependence of planetary climate on the abundances of carbon species and host star type. We find that CO, due to weak absorption of stellar radiation, induces only moderate changes in stratospheric temperature, while its effect on surface temperature is negligible. Under Earth-like $p_\mathrm{N_2}$ (where $p_\mathrm{i}$ is the partial pressure on the surface of species i), for cases with fixed $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$, increase in CO leads to surface cooling on planets orbiting Sun-like stars unless the sum of $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $p_\mathrm{CH_4}$ exceeds $\sim$1 bar. Whereas it results in surface warming for planets around M-type stars. When the total pressure of carbon species is fixed, converting CO\textsubscript{2} or CH\textsubscript{4} into CO always induces cooling. These effects arise from a combination of CO Rayleigh scattering, pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines, and \textcolor{red}{varying water vapor levels}. We further discuss how CO- and CH\textsubscript{4}-driven cooling (warming) can trigger positive (negative) climate-photochemistry feedback, influencing atmospheric evolution. Additionally, we suggest CO-rich planets may be less susceptible to water loss and atmospheric oxidation due to lower stratospheric water vapor content.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Satellite Images with Evaluations on Synoptic Weather Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently, the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE can be a promising outlook for the current work.</description>

      <title>Rare events algorithm study of extreme double jet summers and their connection to heatwaves over Eurasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several large scale circulation patterns have been identified in relation to extreme Northern Hemisphere summer heatwaves. Three main ones are a double jet over Eurasia, a positive phase of the summer northern annular mode, and a quasi-wave-3 geopotential height anomaly. While there is some evidence suggesting these patterns are related to each other, the explicit nature of their relation, as well as the explicit mechanisms by which they are related to extreme heatwaves is still not known. The double jet structure has gained attention recently due to evidence that its persistence has been increasing, possibly explaining the rise in the number of extreme heatwaves over Europe. In this paper we study the occurrence and persistence of double jet states in ERA5 and in stationary simulations with the CESM1.2 model, using an index which measures the degree of jet separation. Additionally, we perform simulations with CESM1.2 coupled to a rare event algorithm in order to improve the statistics of rare summer-long double jet states. We find that extreme double jet states are characterised by three centers of extreme high surface temperature and 500hPa geopotential height anomalies, alongside a strong low pressure over the Arctic. The geopotential height anomaly pattern is consistent with both a positive Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and quasi-wave-3 patterns found in the literature. Moreover, we find a large percentage of co-occurrence of heatwaves at these centers, and a double jet state, with the percentage increasing with the duration of the double jet state.</description>
