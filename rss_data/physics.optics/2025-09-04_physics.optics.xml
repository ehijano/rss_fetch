      <title>Synthesis of higher-order Poincar\'e sphere THz beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method to generate vector vortex THz beams with angular momentum by a pair of pumps was reported. The helicity of the vector THz beam, that from polarization to orbital angular momentum can be finely tuned by manipulating the pulse delay between two pump pulses and a S-waveplate. All the states of THz vector vortices on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere are able to be generated. The synthesis was theoretically explored and experimentally verified. This approach paves the way to the sources of versatile structured THz beams and may benefit the potential applications.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable nonvolatile transmissive metasurface in visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between metasurfaces and non-volatile phase change materials (PCMs) has created many reconfigurable photonic devices for applications in optical memory, optical computing and optical communications. But these advances have been limited to the infrared wavelengths due to the high loss of PCMs in the visible regime. Here we demonstrate a nonvolatile visible metasurface that is electrically reconfigurable using wide bandgap PCM Sb2S3. Our device supports a resonant mode at 610 nm, a wavelength largely under-explored for PCM-based metasurfaces. By incorporating only a 20 nm thick layer of Sb2S3, we experimentally demonstrate a resonance tuning range of 16 nm. Reversible switching of the metasurface is accomplished in situ using a carefully engineered, ultrathin doped silicon micro-heater. Our work paves the way for integrating PCMs into visible-frequency systems, particularly for human-centric applications such as augmented and virtual reality displays.</description>

      <title>On Space Debris Removal by Lasers: Can Spatially and Temporally Shaped Laser Pulses Be Advantageous for Propulsion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For exploration of space, in particular in attempts to find new extra-terrestrial resources, human society has encountered the problem of space pollution with human-made debris, which represents high risks for space missions. This prompted extensive activities for cleaning the space using various techniques, which are briefly overviewed here. But the main focus of this paper is on using lasers for space debris removal. The attention is drawn to laser beam shaping techniques, which are discussed as potential technologies for deorbiting space debris, providing more energetically favorable laser propulsion compared to conventional laser beams.</description>

      <title>An Open-Sourced, Community-Driven Volumetric Additive Manufacturing Printer and Post-Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenCAL is a low cost CAL based printing and post processing platform developed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and standard rapid prototyping tools. The system incorporates recent advancements in VAM, including Optical Scattering Tomography (OST), and is designed with modularity to support future technological integration. The post processing systems developed include standardized procedures for solvent based removal of uncured resin and a centrifugal cleaning module for enhanced material recovery.
  To support the continued advancement of this technology, multiple community engagement pathways have been established to foster the collaborative development of the OpenCAL ecosystem. A primary deployment environment for OpenCAL is academic makerspaces, where the system is specifically designed to leverage the rapid prototyping tools typically available in these facilities. OpenCAL not only introduces advanced volumetric additive manufacturing capabilities to makerspaces but also serves as a platform for hands on education in emerging manufacturing technologies, photopolymer science, and computational imaging. By lowering the barriers to entry for volumetric printing research, OpenCAL enables a broader range of students, from undergraduate to graduate levels, to engage directly in experimental research, contribute to the refinement of open source CAL technologies, and participate in interdisciplinary projects spanning materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer science. In doing so, OpenCAL has the potential to significantly expand the technical capabilities of academic makerspaces, transforming them into hubs for next generation manufacturing innovation and research driven learning.</description>

      <title>Integrated broadband optical isolator via dynamic rotating destructive interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits route and shape light on a chip, but back-reflections feed back into coherent on-chip lasers, destabilizing operation and corrupting signals. Robust operation requires an integrated optical isolator that strongly suppresses backward propagation while maintaining low-loss, broadband forward transmission. However, prior on-chip isolators rely on magneto-optic materials or resonance-based filters, which respectively demand non-standard processes or inherently constrain bandwidth. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a traveling-wave optical isolator without magnetic materials or resonant elements. By driving four parallel optical channels with periodic RF waves, we realize dynamic rotating destructive interference that continuously cancels backward-propagating light while leaving forward-propagating light unaffected. We achieve about 30 dB isolation at a wavelength of 789.7 nm and maintain over 24 dB isolation across an approximately 30 nm bandwidth (770 nm to 800 nm), including &gt;20 dB isolation for two simultaneous lasers within an approximately 10 nm wavelength window. This wavelength span covers key alkali atomic transitions, enabling strong suppression of feedback-induced frequency noise and laser instability in atomic spectroscopy, laser cooling, and locking applications. We demonstrate a practical, broadband on-chip isolator applicable from the visible to the near-infrared, which is a crucial step toward fully integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Versatile, open-source program for simulating high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light sources based on high-harmonic generation (HHG) underpin ultrafast spectroscopy experiments across a large range of photon energies, spanning from the extreme-ultraviolet to the soft x-ray. To this day their design, implementation and improvement presents uniqe challenges, but can be aided by numerical tools. Here we present a new simulation program designed for this purpose, which accurately takes both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of high-harmonic generation into account and is therefore applicable across the broad range of parameters that HHG based light sources are today utilized in. The program is validated by calculating harmonic emission in four common experimental configurations.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 6. demonstration of Lyot low order wavefront control combined with high order wavefront control using a vortex coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reach and maintain high contrast levels, coronagraph instruments will require a combination of low-order and high-order wavefront control techniques to correct for dynamic wavefront error. Efficient low-order wavefront sensing and control (LOWFSC) schemes use the starlight rejected by the coronagraph such that LOWFSC can operate with a relatively bright signal to correct rapid disturbances. Meanwhile, a family of high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) techniques utilizing the science camera have been developed to create regions of high contrast known as dark holes. These two control loops must operate simultaneously for dark holes to be maintained over long observation periods. Using a 952 actuator MEMS deformable mirror and a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB), we demonstrate a Lyot-based LOWFSC loop operating in combination with a HOWFSC loop. For these experiments, implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) is the chosen HOWFSC technique, and we demonstrate how this empirical method can be calibrated and deployed while the LOWFSC loop corrects for dynamic wavefront error. We show this combination of LOWFSC and iEFC maintained 1E-8 contrast levels in air.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically structured, high-efficiency and thermally robust perovskite solar cells with band-engineered double-hole layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promising optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their commercial viability is hindered by interfacial energy misalignment, suboptimal light absorption, and thermal instability. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through integrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address interfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL junction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising CuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level alignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations, combining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite element method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that optimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the CuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However, planar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability, exhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures attain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity, underscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent limitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell (HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the full device stack. This design enhances broadband light trapping and optical confinement throughout the active layers while maintaining fabrication feasibility through geometrically realistic structuring.</description>

      <title>Complex Band Structures and Bound States in the Continuum: A Unified Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex band structures describe resonant modes in periodic systems finite in one direction, crucial for applications in photonics like sensors and lasers. The imaginary frequency component, $\omega''$, tied to quality factors, is often probed through numerical or phenomenological models, limiting deeper insights. Here, we introduce a first-principles framework deriving complex band structures from scattering matrix poles, integrated with perturbation theory to define minimal Hilbert spaces based on interacting Bloch waves. Key results include a two-band model yielding $\omega'' = C(\mathbf{k}_{||})\delta^2$ and identifying accidental bound states in the continuum (BICs) at $C(\mathbf{k}_{||})=0$, with dual Fabry--P\'erot modes from impedance degeneracy; a three-band model reveals Friedrich--Wintgen and symmetry-protected BICs plus linewidth behaviors; inclusion of orthogonal polarizations characterizes far-field states and exceptional points; and the above model can be extended to two-dimensional systems. This unified approach advances light confinement studies, including nano-photonics and interdisciplinary wave physics with broad implications for high-performance optical devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

Abstract: We develop a high-parametric-gain SU(1,1) interferometer based on an aperiodically poled Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (apKTP) crystal, enabling frequency-domain low-coherence interferometry with undetected mid-infrared photons. The system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 40 dB and axial resolution of 30 $\mu$m, with a 3 $\mu$m-centered idler beam. By increasing the poling-period range, we also improve the axial resolution to 17 $\mu$m, demonstrating a straightforward route to enhance the performance by working on the crystal design</description>

      <title>Four-channel Imaging Based on Reconfigurable Metasurfaces: Hyperchaotic Encryption under Physical Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces facilitate high-capacity optical information integration by simultaneously supporting near-field nanoprinting and far-field holography on a single platform. However, conventional multi-channel designs face critical security vulnerabilities for sensitive information due to insufficient encryption mechanisms. In this work, we propose a four-channel phase-change metasurface featuring algorithm-physical co-security-a dual-protection framework combining intrinsic metasurface physical security with chaotic encryption. Our polarization-multiplexed metasurface generates four optical imaging channels through meta-atom design, including two far-field holograms and two near-field patterns. To enhance system security, we apply Chen hyperchaotic encryption combined with the Logistic map and DNA encoding to convert near-field information into secure QR codes; far-field holograms are retained to demonstrate the metasurface's information capacity and for attack detection. Phase-change metasurface further provides physical-layer security by dynamically switching imaging channels via crystalline-to-amorphous state transitions, enhancing anti-counterfeiting and reliability. The proposed metasurface achieves high-fidelity imaging, robust anti-attack performance, and independent channel control. This integrated approach pioneers a secure paradigm for high-density optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Programmable control of the spatiotemporal quantum noise of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoelectronic systems based on multiple modes of light can often exceed the performance of their single-mode counterparts. However, multimode nonlinear interactions often introduce considerable amounts of noise, limiting the ultimate performance of these systems. It is therefore crucial to develop ways to simultaneously control complex nonlinear interactions while also gaining control over their noise. Here, we show that noise buildup in nonlinear multimode systems can be strongly suppressed by controlling the input wavefront. We demonstrate this approach in a multimode fiber by using an active wavefront-shaping protocol to focus a region of high intensity - yet low intensity noise - at the output. Our programmable control of both the input and output reduces the beam noise by 12 dB beyond what linear attenuation achieves, reaching levels near the quantum shot-noise limit. We show that this is possible because the optimally shaped wavefront maximally decouples the output intensity fluctuations from the input laser fluctuations. These findings are supported by a new theoretical and simulation framework that efficiently captures spatiotemporal quantum noise dynamics in highly multimode nonlinear systems. Our results highlight the potential of programmable wavefront shaping to enable nonlinear multimode technologies that overcome noise buildup to operate at quantum-noise limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a hybrid quantum memory that combines Gradient Echo Memory (GEM) and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) protocols for reversible mapping between light and atomic coherence. By leveraging GEM and EIT complementarity, we realize time-to-frequency and frequency-to-time conversion mechanisms for spectro-temporal modes. This capability provides a versatile tool for quantum communication, where coherent frequency-time conversion enhances network interoperability. In addition, the protocol may enable fundamental studies of atomic coherence, including investigations of Rydberg polaritons and mapping of single Rydberg excitations and ionic impurities.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 7. design, fabrication, and first light for a self-coherent camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics tasked future space observatories with the goal of detecting and characterizing a large sample of Earth-like exoplanets. To achieve this, these observatories will require coronagraphs and wavefront control algorithms in order to achieve $10^{-10}$ or better starlight suppression. The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a vacuum compatible testbed at the University of Arizona which aims to advance and mature starlight suppression technologies in a space-like environment. In its current configuration, SCoOB is a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph outfitted with a Kilo-C microelectromechanical systems deformable mirror capable of achieving sub-$10^{-8}$ dark hole contrast at visible wavelengths using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC). In this work, we demonstrate the use of a self-coherent camera (SCC) for dark hole digging and maintenance on SCoOB. The SCC introduces a small off-axis pinhole in the Lyot plane which allows some starlight to reach the focal plane and interfere with residual speckles. This enables high-order focal-plane wavefront sensing which can be combined with active wavefront control to null the speckles in a specified region of high contrast known as the dark hole. We discuss considerations for implementation, potential limitations, and provide a performance comparison with iEFC. We also discuss the design optimization and fabrication process for our SCC Lyot stops.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coatings on Various Substrates for Self-Adaptive Energy Harvesting with Daytime Solar Heating and Nighttime Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metafilms on different substrate materials fabricated via low-oxygen furnace oxidation are demonstrated for self-adaptive daytime solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Because of its thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2 metafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar absorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while they behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively through the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to cold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise up to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are experimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere temperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent agreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high heating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80{\deg}C sample temperature in the middle of the day, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30{\deg}C in equilibrium with ambient at night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings with cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy for imaging of localized optical fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy aims for imaging transient phenomena occurring on nanoscale. One of its goals is to visualize localized optical and plasmonic modes generated by coherent excitation in the vicinity of various types of nanostructures. Such imaging capability was enabled by photoninduced near-field optical microscopy, which is based on spectral filtering of electrons inelastically scattered due to the stimulated interaction with the nearfield. Here, we report on the development of ultrafast four-dimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy, which allows us to image the transverse components of the optical near-field while avoiding the need of electron spectral filtering. We demonstrate that this method is capable of imaging the integrated Lorentz force generated by optical near-fields of a tungsten nanotip and the ponderomotive potential of an optical standing wave with a spatial resolution of 21 nm.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum: setting the record straight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24375v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <title>Versatile silicon integrated photonic processor: a reconfigurable solution for next-generation AI clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence models pose serious challenges in intensive computing and high-bandwidth communication for conventional electronic circuit-based computing clusters. Silicon photonic technologies, owing to their high speed, low latency, large bandwidth, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, have been widely implemented for data transfer and actively explored as photonic neural networks in AI clusters. However, current silicon photonic integrated chips lack adaptability for multifuncional use and hardware-software systematic coordination. Here, we develop a reconfigurable silicon photonic processor with $40$ programmable unit cells integrating over $160$ component, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to realize diverse functions with a chip for AI clusters, from computing acceleration and signal processing to network swtiching and secure encryption. Through a self-developed automated testing, compilation, and tuning framework to the processor without in-network monitoring photodetectors, we implement $4\times4$ dual-direction unitary and $3\times3$ uni-direction non-unitary matrix multiplications, neural networks for image recognition, micro-ring modulator wavelength locking, $4\times4$ photonic channel switching , and silicon photonic physical unclonable functions. This optoelectronic processing system, incorporating the photonic processor and its software stack, paves the way for both advanced photonic system-on-chip design and the construction of photo-electronic AI clusters.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement high-resolution ($&lt;1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Moreover, we identify robust differences between our data and DFT calculations that hint at the modification of the infrared molecular response by the nanocavity environment. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational spectroscopy at the chip level.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g. biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor. Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of $\approx~62.5\mu m$, limited only by the resolution of our DMD projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Optical Integration With Heralded Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>

      <title>Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>
