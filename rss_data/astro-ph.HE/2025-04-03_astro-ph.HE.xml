      <title>A kinetic model of jet-corona coupling in accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) accretion disks are often coupled to ultramagnetized and tenuous plasma coronae close to their central BHs. The coronal magnetic field can exchange energy between the disk and the BH, power X-ray emission, and lead to jetted outflows. Up until now, the coronal physics of BH accretion has only been studied using fluid modeling. We construct the first model of a BH feeding on a zero-net-flux accretion disk corona based on kinetic plasma physics. This allows us to self-consistently capture how collisionless relativistic magnetic reconnection regulates the coronal dynamics. We present global, axisymmetric, general relativistic particle-in-cell simulation of a BH coupled, via a series of magnetic loops, to a razor-thin accretion disk. We target the jet-launching regime where the loops are much larger than the BH. We ray-trace high-energy synchrotron lightcurves and track the flow of Poynting flux through the system, including along specific field-line bundles. Reconnection on field lines coupling the BH to the disk dominates the synchrotron output, regulates the flux threading the BH, and ultimately untethers magnetic loops from the disk, ejecting them via a magnetically striped Blandford-Znajek jet. The jet is initially Poynting-dominated, but reconnection operates at all radii, depleting the Poynting power logarithmically in radius. Coronal emission and jet launch are linked through reconnection in our model. This link might explain coincident X-ray flaring and radio-jet ejections observed during hard-to-soft X-ray binary state transitions. It also suggests that striped jet launch could be heralded by a bright coronal counterpart. Our synchrotron signatures resemble variability observed from the peculiar changing-look AGN, 1ES 1927+654, and from Sagittarius A*, hinting that processes similar to our model may be at work in these contexts.</description>

      <title>The Remarkable Late-Time Flux Excess in Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Type Iax Supernova 2012Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, peculiar and underluminous compared to the normal type Ia supernovae. Observations of SNe Iax provide insight into the physics of white-dwarf explosions and suggest that some may not be terminal events. Late-time photometry ($\sim$1400 days post-peak) of the type Iax SN 2012Z, the only white dwarf supernova with a pre-explosion detection of a progenitor system, revealed a flux excess that may be explained by a gravitationally bound remnant driving a radioactively powered wind. We present further late-time Hubble Space Telescope photometry of SN 2012Z, $\sim$2500 days after the explosion, and find that the SN is still brighter than, but trending towards, the pre-explosion flux. Additionally, we observe that the excess F555W flux seen in previous data has grown more pronounced. The color of the excess flux disfavors a light echo or interaction with the circumstellar material. The decline rate of the excess flux is consistent with energy deposition from $^{55}$Fe, but the luminosity is higher than expected from models of the ejecta, further suggesting evidence for a bound remnant. Combining our data with future observations should allow for the detection of emission from the ejecta shock-heating of the companion helium star seen in the progenitor system.</description>

      <title>Radiative relativistic turbulence as an in situ pair-plasma source in blazar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As powerful gamma-ray engines, blazars -- relativistic plasma jets launched toward Earth from active galactic nuclei -- are manifestly high-energy particle accelerators. Yet, exactly how these jets accelerate particles as well as what they are made of both remain largely mysterious. In this work, we argue that these issues may be linked through the gamma-ray emission for which blazars are renowned. Namely, high-energy photons produced at sites of intense particle acceleration could be absorbed by soft radiation within the jet, enriching it with electron-positron pairs. We explore this possibility in the specific context of particle acceleration by magnetized radiative relativistic turbulence. Using a combination of theory, particle-in-cell simulations, and Fokker-Planck modeling, we identify and characterize a novel pair-production-mediated equilibration mechanism in such turbulence. Initially, turbulent energy injection outpaces radiative cooling, leading to runaway particle acceleration and gamma-ray radiation. Then, gamma-ray absorption begets copious newborn pairs, slowing subsequent particle acceleration. This eventually brings particle acceleration into balance with radiative cooling and shuts down pair production: a pair-enriched final equilibrium. We estimate that this process could significantly load jets of flat-spectrum radio quasars with fresh pairs. These results represent an important connection between particle acceleration and plasma composition in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Inference from Polarized Light Curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric light curves of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) sometimes exhibit loops in the Stokes Q and U plane over time, often interpreted as orbiting hotspot motion. In this work, we apply the differential geometry of planar curves to develop a new technique for estimating polarimetric rotation rates. Applying this technique to 230 GHz light curves of Sgr A*, we find evidence of clockwise motion not only during a post-flare period on 2017 April 11th, as previously discovered, but also during the quiescent days imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The data exhibit a clockwise fraction of $0.67 \pm 0.09$ and an overall Q-U rotation rate of $-3.7 \pm 1.2 \ \mathrm{deg}\,t_g^{-1}$. We analyze a library of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and find that face-on, clockwise-rotating models with strong magnetic fields are most likely to be consistent with the observations. These results are consistent with EHT and GRAVITY Collaboration studies, and indirectly support an interpretation in which the polarized image of Sagittarius A* has been rotated by an external Faraday screen. This technique offers a novel probe of event horizon scale dynamics that complements dynamical reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Persistent radio sources associated with fast radio bursts: Implications from magnetar progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare association of three persistent radio sources (confirmed PRS1 and PRS2, candidate PRS3) with repeating fast radio bursts (FRB 20121102A, 20190520B, 20201124A) offers a unique probe into their magneto-ionic environments. PRSs are attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic charged particles of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) powered by spin-down magnetohydrodynamic wind or internal magnetic field decay. Using a multizone hydrodynamic model, we track MWN evolution to constrain magnetar progenitor properties. For PRS1 and PRS2, we find an equipartition radius $R_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.1 $ pc that is consistent with the radio scintillation estimates ($&gt; 0.03$ pc) and radio imaging limits ($&lt;0.7$ pc). This compact size favors low expansion speeds and large initial spin periods, $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, ruling out millisecond magnetar progenitors. Given $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, a current size of $\sim 0.1$ pc, a supernova kinetic energy $E_\mathrm{ SN} \sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg and an ejecta mass $M \sim 3-10 \; M_{\odot}$, the PRS age is $t \sim 10-10^{2}$ yr. PRSs with $t&gt;20$ years require an internal field ($B_\mathrm{int} \sim 10^{16}-10^{16.5}\;$G) with a decay timescale $t_\mathrm{d} \sim 10-10^{2.5}$ yr. The slowest field decay ($t_\mathrm{d,max} \sim 500$ yr) favors sub-energetic supernovae ($E_\mathrm{SN} \sim 10^{50}$ erg) with massive ejecta ($M \gtrsim 10\; M_{\odot}$) and low ionization fraction ($\sim 3\% $). For the sub-energetic scenario for the confirmed PRSs, we predict a cooling break at $100-150$ gigahertz at $20-40 \; \mu \text{Jy}$ and self-absorption near 200 megahertz at $180\; \mu \text{Jy}$. For PRS3, a rotation-powered MWN is viable only if $t \sim 10$ yr; an inverted spectrum beyond 150 gigahertz would rule out this scenario.</description>

      <title>Observational diversity of bright long-lived Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various types of supernovae (SNe), strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) has been reported. This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\sim-17$ to $\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric spectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with some variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with slight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time (from $\sim3-6$ \% before the peak to $\sim1$ \% at $\sim200$ days after the peak). The observational properties are consistent with the disk-CSM-interaction scenario, i.e., typical Type~II SNe interacting with disk-like CSM.</description>

      <title>An advanced pulse-avalanche stochastic model of long gamma-ray burst light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified explanation of the variety of long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) is essential for identifying the dissipation mechanism and possibly the nature of their central engines. In the past, a model was proposed to describe GRB LCs as the outcome of a stochastic pulse avalanche process, possibly originating from a turbulent regime, and it was tested by comparing average temporal properties of simulated and real LCs. Recently, we revived this model and optimised its parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA), a machine-learning-based approach. Our findings suggested that GRB inner engines may operate near a critical regime. Here we present an advanced version of the model, which allows us to constrain the peak flux distribution of individual pulses, and evaluate its performance on a new dataset of GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). After introducing new model parameters and a further comparison metric, that is the observed signal-to-noise (S/N) distribution, we test the new model on three complementary datasets: CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT, and Fermi/GBM. As in our previous work, the model parameters are optimised using a GA. The updated sets of parameters achieve a further reduction in loss compared to both the original model and our earlier optimisation. The different values of the parameters across the datasets are shown to originate from the different energy passbands, effective areas, trigger algorithms, and, ultimately, different GRB populations of the three experiments. Our results further underpin the stochastic and avalanche character of the dissipation process behind long GRB prompt emission, with an emphasis on the near-critical behaviour, and establish this new model as a reliable tool for generating realistic GRB LCs as they would be seen with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Searching for kilonova with the SiTian prototype telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the optical searching of gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger event (i.e., a kilonova) using the ground based {\it SiTian} project prototype telescope with a 5-min limiting magnitude of 22.0, triggered by LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors during the ongoing O4 run. Our simulations show that an average of 0.17-0.25 kilonova events can be observed over the entire O4 period of $\sim 2$ years in the most optimistic case we set, while no kilonova can be detected in other cases. We note that it is beneficial for {\it SiTian}'s kilonova searching by extending the exposure time to gain deeper limiting magnitude despite the rapid decline of kilonova luminosity.</description>

      <title>A discussion on the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Tibet AS{\gamma} experiment and the total Galactic gamma-ray flux measured by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) are found to be consistent, within the statistical and systematic uncertainties, for the inner Galactic Plane region in the sub-PeV energy range (E &gt; 10^14 eV). The result suggests that the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray flux is dominated by the diffuse emission. On the other hand, the LHAASO observations suggest that the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources presented in the first LHAASO catalog possibly give a significant contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission ($\approx$ 60%). However, the estimate must be regarded as a conservative upper limit. In fact, current gamma-ray observations imply that many of the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO have a cutoff or significant softening in their energy spectra in the several tens of TeV energy range, and the resolved-source contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission should be much lower than the above estimate. More sophisticated discussion about the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission requires detailed spectral studies of the individual gamma-ray sources and an accurate estimate of the contamination of the source fluxes from the diffuse emission.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Synchro-curvature description of {\gamma}-ray light curves and spectra of pulsars: concurrent fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concurrent fitting of spectra and light curves of the whole population of detected gamma-ray pulsars. Using a synchro-curvature model we compare our theoretical output with the observational data published in the Third Fermi Pulsar Catalog, which has significantly increased the number of known gamma-ray pulsars. Our model properly fits all the spectra and reproduces well a considerable fraction of light curves. Light curve fitting is carried out with two different techniques, whose strong points and caveats are discussed. We use a weighted reduced \{chi}^2 of light curves in time domain, and the Euclidean distance of the Fourier transform of the light curves, i.e. transforming the light curves to the frequency domain. The performance of both methods is found to be qualitatively similar, but individual best-fit solutions may differ. We also show that, in our model based on few effective parameters, the light curve fitting is basically insensitive to the timing and spectral parameters of the pulsar. Finally, we look for correlations between model and physical parameters, and recover trends found in previous studies but without any significant correlation involving geometrical parameters.</description>

      <title>General relativistic effects on photon spectrum emitted from dark matter halos around primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

      <title>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes in the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity by investigating its response to linear perturbations, including scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. To analyze the stability of the JMN-1 naked singularity under axial perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The quasinormal mode frequencies provides information about the stability of spacetime, with the real part of the frequency determining the oscillation rate and the imaginary part governing the decay or growth of perturbations. Our results indicate that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we find that the JMN-1 spacetime remains dynamically stable under axial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory. Our study focuses on five fundamental polarization states predicted in GQFT: two tensor ($+, \times$), two vector (x, y), and one scalar (breathing) mode, focusing on their distinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and Taiji. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame, we identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference patterns between polarization modes, (2) distinctive null-point signatures enabling mode discrimination, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection windows. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization mapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably avoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The results are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical insights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future detector networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental gravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints, with particular relevance for upcoming multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Variable Continuum Lags in PG 2130+099</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (RM) provides a measure of the size of the continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous monitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum emitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\sim$6 months of observations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and widest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our results indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG 2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest predictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly consistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced $\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\alpha$. We find some evidence of increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too uncertain to be definitive.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both the shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the quasinormal modes-graybody factors correspondence's in the context of the Hawking spectra for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between black shadows and graybody factors by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are thereof discussed. This study opens new perspectives, by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter with Polarization Measurements of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates. A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek periodic oscillation in the polarization angles (PAs) of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}&lt;(3.4 \times 10^{-11}-1.9\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would extend the constraints to lower masses. Although the $g_{a \gamma}$ constraints derived from FRBs are less competitive than those from other methods, FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.</description>

      <title>An activity transition in FRB 20201124A: methodological rigor, detection of frequency-dependent cessation, and a geometric magnetar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the repeating source FRB 20201124A with Apertif/WSRT and GMRT, and measurements of basic burst properties, especially the dispersion measure (DM) and fluence. Based on comparisons of these properties with previously published larger samples, we argue that the excess DM reported earlier for pulses with integrated signal to noise ratio $\lesssim 1000$ is due to incompletely accounting for the so-called sad trombone effect, even when using structure-maximizing DM algorithms. Our investigations of fluence distributions next lead us to advise against formal power-law fitting, especially dissuading the use of the least-square method, and we demonstrate the large biases involved. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) provides a much more accurate estimate of the power law and we provide accessible code for direct inclusion in future research. Our GMRT observations were fortuitously scheduled around the end of the activity cycle as recorded by FAST. We detected several bursts (one of them very strong) at 400/600 MHz, a few hours after sensitive FAST non-detections already showed the 1.3 GHz FRB emission to have ceased. After FRB 20180916B, this is a second example of a frequency-dependent activity window identified in a repeating FRB source. Since numerous efforts have so-far failed to determine a spin period for FRB 20201124A, we conjecture it to be an ultra-long period magnetar, with a period on the scale of months, and with a very wide, highly irregular duty cycle. Assuming the emission comes from closed field lines, we use radius-to-frequency mapping and polarization information from other studies to constrain the magnetospheric geometry and location of the emission region. Our initial findings are consistent with a possible connection between FRBs and crustal motion events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto black holes can be used as input to a postprocessing scheme that predicts the radiated spectrum. Combining a relativistic Compton scattering radiation transfer solution in the corona with detailed local atmosphere solutions incorporating local ionization and thermal balance within the disk photosphere, it is possible to study both spectral formation and intrinsic spectral variability in the radiation from relativistic accretion disks. With this method, we find that radiatively efficient systems with black holes of $10M_\odot$ accreting at $\approx 0.01$ in Eddington units produce spectra very similar to those observed in the hard states of X-ray binaries. The spectral shape above 10keV is well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff. Intrinsic turbulent variations lead to order-unity changes in bolometric luminosity, variations in the logarithmic spectral slope $\sim 0.1$, and factor of 2 alterations in the cutoff energy on timescales $\sim 50(M_{\rm BH}/10 M_\odot)$ms. Within the corona, the range of gas temperature spans more than 1 order of magnitude. The wide distribution of temperatures is central to defining the spectrum: the logarithmic spectral slope is harder by $\sim 0.3$ and the cutoff energy larger by a factor $\sim 10 - 30$ than if the coronal temperature everywhere were its mass-weighted mean.</description>

      <title>Black hole pulsars and monster shocks as outcomes of black hole--neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of a black hole (BH) and a neutron star (NS) in most cases is expected to leave no material around the remnant BH; therefore, such events are often considered as sources of gravitational waves without electromagnetic counterparts. However, a bright counterpart can emerge if the NS is strongly magnetized, as its external magnetosphere can experience radiative shocks and magnetic reconnection during/after the merger. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the dynamical spacetime of a merging BH--NS binary to investigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We find that compressive waves excited in the magnetosphere develop into monster shocks as they propagate outward. After swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a magnetosphere that quickly evolves into a split monopole configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay (balding), enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down of the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into rotation, forming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped wind if the swallowed magnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin axis. We predict two types of transients from this scenario: (1) a fast radio burst emitted by the shocks as they expand to large radii and (2) an X/$\gamma$-ray burst emitted by the $e^\pm$ outflow heated by magnetic dissipation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made over the past decades towards unveiling the sources of the most energetic particles in nature, the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Despite these advancements, the exact astrophysical sites capable of accelerating these particles to such extreme energies remain largely unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms by which they achieve these extreme energies are poorly understood. Here, I provide a concise overview of the theory underlying the acceleration and propagation of UHECRs. I then critically discuss three recent results that could help unveil their origins: the reported excess around Centaurus A, the correlation with starburst galaxies, and the efforts to jointly model the energy spectrum, composition, and arrival directions. Finally, I discuss strategies for advancing this field, emphasising the need for refined theoretical models, the challenges in building them, and the potential for new observatories to shed light on the mysteries of UHECRs.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>The Ejection of Transient Jets in Swift J1727.8-1613 Revealed by Time-Dependent Visibility Modelling</title>

Abstract: High angular resolution radio observations of relativistic jets are necessary to understand the causal connection between accretion and jet ejection in low mass X-ray binaries. Images from these observations can be difficult to reconstruct due to the rapid intra-observational motion and variability of transient jets. We have developed a time-dependent visibility model fitting and self-calibration procedure and applied it to a single four-hour VLBA observation of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 during the bright flaring period of its 2023 outburst. This allowed us to detect and model a slightly resolved self-absorbed compact core, as well as three downstream transient jet knots. We were able to precisely measure the proper motion and flux density variability of these three jet knots, as well as (for the first time) their intra-observational expansion. Using simultaneous multi-frequency data, we were also able to measure the spectral index of the furthest downstream jet knot, and the core, as well as the frequency-dependent core shift between 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. Using these measurements, we inferred the ejection dates of the three jet knots, including one to within $\pm40$ minutes, which is one of the most precise ever measured. The ejection of the transient jet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray spectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest association ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in an X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion inflow.</description>

      <title>The Type I Superluminous Supernova Catalogue II: Spectroscopic Evolution in the Photospheric Phase, Velocity Measurements, and Constraints on Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are among the most energetic explosions in the universe, reaching luminosities up to 100 times greater than those of normal supernovae. Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to reveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the largest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data from ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022. The dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing average phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures (10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation follows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading to stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe may contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly reduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than peak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain the same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion, suggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we identify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for energy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or more statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\lambda}5169 lines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits, indicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation between velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are in homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour aligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.</description>

      <title>High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS typically wraps around the pulsar, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a marginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in J2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to estimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\rm IBS} \sim 40-100$ G and place lower bounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the magnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave constraints on the GWTC-2 events by measuring the tidal deformability and the spin-induced quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09193v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide a unique laboratory to test properties of compact objects. As alternatives to the ordinary black holes in general relativity, various exotic compact objects have been proposed. Some of them have largely different values of the tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment from those of black holes, and their binaries could be distinguished from the binary black hole by using gravitational waves emitted during their inspiral regime, excluding the highly model-dependent merger and ringdown regimes. We reanalyze gravitational waves from low-mass merger events in the GWTC-2, detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Focusing on the influence of tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment in the inspiral waveform, we provide model-independent constraints on deviations from the standard binary black hole case. We find that all events that we have analyzed are consistent with the waveform of the binary black hole in general relativity. Bayesian model selection shows that the hypothesis that the binary is composed of exotic compact objects is disfavored by all events.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed and superradiance is not observed, possibly due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion/scalar decay constant and energy density. We generalize these bounds for vector and spin-2 fields.</description>

      <title>Average energy of the X-ray spectrum as a model-independent proxy for the mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature of the hot gas in galaxy clusters is known to be a reliable proxy for their total gravitating mass, allowing one to use spectroscopic X-ray observations for halo mass function measurements. Data of shallow wide area surveys, however, often precludes direct fitting of the X-ray spectra, given possible biases arising due to unresolved (multi-temperature) inner structure of the intracluster medium (ICM), projection effects and necessity of certain model assumptions to be made to allow for robust spectral fitting. We consider using a simple observable value - the average energy of the observed cluster X-ray spectrum - as a model-independent proxy for the ICM temperature, and consequently cluster's mass. We calibrate relation of this proxy to the cluster parameters using mock observations for a sample of 84 massive galaxy clusters extracted from the \textit{Magneticum} cosmological hydro simulations. We consider observational parameters corresponding to the all-sky survey observations by \textit{SRG/eROSITA}. Taking into account contributions of various background and foreground signals, average energy of the simulated X-ray spectra in the $0.4-7.0$ keV band is shown to be a stable indicator of the ICM temperature with $\sim10\%$ scatter and cluster's mass $M_{500}$ with a $\sim 20\%$ scatter. A database containing simulated X-ray images and their spectra (subtracted in several concentric rings) is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Determining the minimal mass of a proto-neutron star with chirally constrained nuclear equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution are investigated. In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \sim 0.62M_{\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \sim 0.22M_{\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect nuclear forces to one of the most notable irregular behaviors observed in pulsars, already detected in approximately 6\% known pulsars, with increasingly accurate data expected from upcoming high-precision timing instruments on both ground and space. Built on Shang &amp; Li (2021), we conduct a case study on the 2001 glitch of the Vela pulsar. For our purpose, we adopt the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model as the theoretical many-body framework to describe nuclear systems. We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the snowplow model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>
