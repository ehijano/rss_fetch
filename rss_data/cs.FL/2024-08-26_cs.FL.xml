      <title>Exponent-Strings and Their Edit Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exponent-string is an extension of traditional strings that can incorporate real-numbered exponents, indicating the quantity of characters. This novel representation overcomes the limitations of traditional discrete string by enabling precise data representation for applications such as phonetic transcription that contains sound duration.
  Although applications of exponent-string are focused on exponent-string with real-numbered exponents, formal definition uses arbitrary semigroup. For any semigroup $S$, $S$-exponent-strings are allowed to have elements of $S$ as exponents. We investigate algebraic properties of $S$-exponent-strings and further justify $\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-string is a natural extension of the string.
  Motivated by the problem of calculating the similarity between spoken phone sequence and correct phone sequence, we develop exp-edit distance -- a specialized metric designed to measure the similarity between $\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-strings. By extending the traditional string edit distance to handle continuous values, exp-edit distance deals with $\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-strings that embody both discrete and continuous properties. Our exploration includes a rigorous mathematical formulation of exp-edit distance and an algorithm to compute it.</description>

      <title>Context-free graphs and their transition groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of groups arising from context-free inverse graphs. We provide closure properties, prove that their co-word problems are context-free, study the torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Furthermore, we use a generalized version of the free product of graphs and prove that such a product is context-free inverse closed. We also exhibit an example of a group in our class that is not residually finite and one that is not poly-context-free. These properties make them interesting candidates to disprove both the Lehnert conjecture (which characterizes co-context-free groups as all subgroups of Thompson's group V) and the Brough conjecture (which characterizes finitely generated poly-context-free groups as virtual finitely generated subgroups of direct products of free groups).</description>

      <title>Introducing Divergence for Infinite Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the reachability probability in infinite state probabilistic models has been the topic of numerous works. Here we introduce a new property called divergence that when satisfied allows to compute reachability probabilities up to an arbitrary precision. One of the main interest of divergence is that this computation does not require the reachability problem to be decidable. Then we study the decidability of divergence for random walks and the probabilistic versions of Petri nets where the weights associated with transitions may also depend on the current state. This should be contrasted with most of the existing works that assume weights independent of the state. Such an extended framework is motivated by the modeling of real case studies. Moreover, we exhibit some subclasses of channel systems and pushdown automata that are divergent by construction, particularly suited for specifying open distributed systems and networks prone to performance collapsing where probabilities related to service requirements are needed. where probabilities related to service requirements are needed.</description>
