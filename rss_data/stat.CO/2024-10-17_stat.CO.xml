      <title>Stochastic 3D reconstruction of cracked polycrystalline NMC particles using 2D SEM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li-ion battery performance is strongly influenced by their cathodes' properties and consequently by the 3D microstructure of the particles the cathodes are comprised of. During calendaring and cycling, cracks develop within cathode particles, which may affect performance in multiple ways. On the one hand, cracks reduce internal connectivity such that electron transport within cathode particles is hindered. On the other hand, intra-particle cracks can increase the cathode reactive surface. Due to these contradictory effects, it is necessary to quantitatively investigate how battery cycling effects cracking and how cracking in-turn influences battery performance. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the 3D particle morphology with structural descriptors and quantitatively correlate them with effective battery properties. Typically, 3D structural characterization is performed using image data. However, informative 3D imaging techniques are time-consuming, costly and rarely available, such that analyses often have to rely on 2D image data. This paper presents a novel stereological approach for generating virtual 3D cathode particles that exhibit crack networks that are statistically equivalent to those observed in 2D sections of experimentally measured particles. Consequently, more easily available 2D image data suffices for deriving a full 3D characterization of cracked cathodes particles. In future research, the virtually generated 3D particles will be used as geometry input for spatially resolved electro-chemo-mechanical simulations, to enhance our understanding of structure-property relationships of cathodes in Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Control of Probability Flow in Markov Chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>
