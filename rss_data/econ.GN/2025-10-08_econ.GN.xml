      <title>The role of work-life balance in effective business management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the role of work-life balance (WLB) as a strategic component of effective business management and its influence on employee motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational performance. Drawing on a quantitative survey of 102 economically active individuals, the research investigates the effectiveness of various WLB initiatives, including flexible working hours, private medical care, and additional employee benefits. The results reveal that flexible working arrangements are the most impactful tool for enhancing work-life balance and significantly contribute to higher levels of employee motivation. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between perceived work-life balance and motivation, indicating that improving WLB directly strengthens commitment, reduces burnout, and increases job satisfaction. Moreover, the findings highlight differences in WLB perceptions across demographic groups, suggesting the need for tailored policies. The study emphasizes that organizations actively supporting WLB achieve greater employee loyalty, improved productivity, and enhanced employer branding. These results have practical implications for human resource strategies, showing that integrating WLB initiatives can improve overall organizational performance and societal well-being. The paper also identifies research gaps and recommends exploring cultural, occupational, and remote work contexts in future studies to better understand how WLB strategies shape workforce engagement in dynamic labor markets.</description>

      <title>The challenge of employee motivation in business management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of employee motivation as a critical factor in effective business management and explores how financial and non-financial motivators shape engagement and performance. Based on a quantitative survey of 102 employees, the research analyzes differences in motivation levels across gender, age, and work experience, as well as the perceived effectiveness of various motivational tools. The findings indicate that financial incentives, particularly bonuses for achieving targets, are the most influential motivators, while non-financial factors such as flexible work schedules, additional leave, career development opportunities, and workplace atmosphere also play a crucial role in enhancing motivation. Significant variations in motivation were observed, with men, older employees, and those with longer tenure reporting higher levels. The study also reveals that work-life balance initiatives substantially increase motivation, highlighting the importance of combining financial and non-financial strategies to achieve optimal results. The results provide actionable insights for managers seeking to design effective motivation systems, showing that tailored, multifaceted approaches can improve employee satisfaction, retention, and organizational performance. Future research could explore cultural and sectoral differences and examine the evolving importance of motivational factors in remote and hybrid work environments.</description>

      <title>The impact of leadership styles on project efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of various leadership styles on project efficiency across diverse organizational contexts. Using a quantitative research design, data were collected through a survey of 100 project professionals representing multiple industries, and analyzed with statistical techniques, including Spearman correlation, to explore the relationship between leadership behaviors and project performance. The results show that leadership style significantly affects project outcomes, with constructive feedback, clear communication of goals, role clarity, and encouragement of team initiative emerging as the most impactful behaviors. These factors strongly correlate with project success indicators such as goal achievement, budget adherence, and stakeholder satisfaction. The findings also highlight areas needing improvement, including time management, conflict resolution, and involving team members in decision-making. Moreover, the study provides empirical evidence that leadership styles directly shape team dynamics, motivation, and collaboration, which in turn influence overall efficiency. While democratic and participative approaches enhance engagement, they do not always translate directly into measurable project results in the short term. The study contributes to the literature by bridging the gap between leadership theory and project management practice, offering actionable insights for managers seeking to optimize team performance. Future research should consider larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to assess the long-term impact of leadership behaviors on project success.</description>

      <title>Cosmos 1.0: a multidimensional map of the emerging technology frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Cosmos 1.0 dataset and describes a novel methodology for creating and mapping a universe of technologies, adjacent concepts, and entities. We utilise various source data that contain a rich diversity and breadth of contemporary knowledge. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset comprises 23,544 technology-adjacent entities (TA23k) with a hierarchical structure and eight categories of external indices. Each entity is represented by a 100-dimensional contextual embedding vector, which we use to assign it to seven thematic tech-clusters (TC7) and three meta tech-clusters (TC3). We manually verify 100 emerging technologies (ET100). This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index. The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the constructed indices.</description>
