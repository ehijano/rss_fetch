      <title>Enhanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Response with Preserved Biocompatibility via (MnZn)Ferrite--Polyacrylonitrile Composite Nanofiber Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Quantum Chemistry Relaxations via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational quantum chemistry plays a critical role in drug discovery, chemical synthesis, and materials science. While first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), provide high accuracy in modeling electronic structures and predicting molecular properties, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as promising surrogate models that aim to achieve DFT-level accuracy while enabling efficient large-scale atomistic simulations. The development of accurate and transferable MLIPs requires large-scale, high-quality datasets with both energy and force labels. Critically, MLIPs must generalize not only to stable geometries but also to intermediate, non-equilibrium conformations encountered during atomistic simulations. In this work, we introduce PubChemQCR, a large-scale dataset of molecular relaxation trajectories curated from the raw geometry optimization outputs of the PubChemQC project. PubChemQCR is the largest publicly available dataset of DFT-based relaxation trajectories for small organic molecules, comprising approximately 3.5 million trajectories and over 300 million molecular conformations computed at various levels of theory. Each conformation is labeled with both total energy and atomic forces, making the dataset suitable for training and evaluating MLIPs. To provide baselines for future developments, we benchmark nine representative MLIP models on the dataset. Our resources are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/divelab</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological breakthroughs in spatial omics and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to transform the understanding of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Here we review the role of AI in spatial omics, discussing the current state-of-the-art and further needs to decipher cancer biology from large-scale spatial tissue data. An overarching challenge is the development of interpretable spatial AI models, an activity which demands not only improved data integration, but also new conceptual frameworks. We discuss emerging paradigms, in particular data-driven spatial AI, constraint-based spatial AI, and mechanistic spatial modeling, as well as the importance of integrating AI with hypothesis-driven strategies and model systems to realize the value of cancer spatial information.</description>

      <title>Attribution assignment for deep-generative sequence models enables interpretability analysis using positive-only data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies without the need for negative training data.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Quantized Diffusion Based Tree Generation Method for Hierarchical Representation and Lineage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity, and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code_HDTree_review-A8DB.</description>

      <title>VALID-Mol: a Systematic Framework for Validated LLM-Assisted Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering, automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is essential.</description>

      <title>Time-structured models of population growth in fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1. Although environmental variability is expected to play a more prominent role under climate change, current demographic models that ignore the differential environmental histories of cohorts across generations are unlikely to accurately predict population dynamics and growth. The use of these approaches, which we collectively refer to as non time-structured models or nTSMs, will instead yield error-prone estimates by giving rise to a form of ecological memory loss due to their inability to account for the historical effects of past environmental exposure on subsequent growth rates.
  2. To address this important issue, we introduce a new class of time-structured models or TSMs that accurately depict growth under variable environments by splitting seemingly homogeneous populations into distinct demographic cohorts based on their past exposure to environmental fluctuations. By accounting for this cryptic population structure, TSMs accurately simulate the historical effects of environmental variability, even when individuals exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity.
  3. Here, we provide a conceptual framework, the mathematical tools needed to simulate any TSM, and a closed form solution for simple exponential growth. We then show that traditional nTSMs yield large errors compared to TSMs when estimating population dynamics under fluctuating temperatures. Overall, TSMs represent a critical tool for predicting population growth in a variable world.</description>

      <title>Nanoplasmonic Optical Fiber Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Using an Aptamer-DNA Tetrahedron Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical fiber sensing carries a number of potential advantages for diagnostics and biomarker detection and monitoring, yet particular challenges persist in linking molecular recognition events to a change in the refractive index. DNA aptamers carry particular advantages as functional surface molecules on optical fibers to tailor detection of specific biomolecules, yet challenges persist around sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis of COVID-19 through detection of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV-2 provides a classic diagnostic challenge where optical fiber-based sensing could complement and improve on typical detection methods such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing. In this study, a plasmonic gold-coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG)-based optical biosensing platform was developed for ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. By functionalizing the optical fiber surface with aptamers for the molecular recognition of N protein, changes in refractive index measured biomolecular binding, thereby achieving real-time, label-free detection. Additionally, integrating DNA nanostructures such as the DNA tetrahedron with aptamers significantly enhanced detection sensitivity, increasing signal intensity ~2.5 times compared to aptamers alone. This study provides new insights into the development of high-performance optical fiber sensing platforms which integrate DNA nanostructure interfaces to facilitate biomarker recognition and sensing.</description>

      <title>GatingTree: Pathfinding Analysis of Group-Specific Effects in Cytometry Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in cytometry technologies have led to a remarkable increase in the number of markers that can be analyzed simultaneously, presenting significant challenges in data analysis. Traditional approaches, such as dimensional reduction techniques and computational clustering, although popular, often face reproducibility challenges due to their heavy reliance on inherent data structures, preventing direct translation of their outputs into gating strategies to be used in downstream experiments. Here we propose the novel Gating Tree methodology, a pathfinding approach that investigates the multidimensional data landscape to unravel group-specific features without the use of dimensional reduction. This method employs novel measures, including enrichment scores and gating entropy, to effectively identify group-specific features within high-dimensional cytometric datasets. Our analysis, applied to both simulated and real cytometric datasets, demonstrates that the Gating Tree not only identifies group-specific features comprehensively but also produces outputs that are immediately usable as gating strategies for unequivocally identifying cell populations. In conclusion, the Gating Tree facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the multidimensional data landscape and provides experimentalists with practical, successive gating strategies that enhance cross-experimental comparisons and downstream analyses such as flow cytometric sorting.</description>

      <title>TockyPrep: Data Preprocessing Methods for Flow Cytometric Fluorescent Timer Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Fluorescent Timer proteins, which display time-dependent changes in their emission spectra, are invaluable for analyzing the temporal dynamics of cellular events at the single-cell level. We previously developed the Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) tools, utilizing a specific Timer protein, Fast-FT, to monitor temporal changes in cellular activities. Despite their potential, the analysis of Timer fluorescence in flow cytometry is frequently compromised by variability in instrument settings and the absence of standardized preprocessing methods. The development and implementation of effective data preprocessing methods remain to be achieved.
  Results: In this study, we introduce the R package that automates the data preprocessing of Timer fluorescence data from flow cytometry experiments for quantitative analysis at single-cell level. Our aim is to standardize Timer data analysis to enhance reproducibility and accuracy across different experimental setups. The package includes a trigonometric transformation method to elucidate the dynamics of Fluorescent Timer proteins. We have identified the normalization of immature and mature Timer fluorescence data as essential for robust analysis, clarifying how this normalization affects the analysis of Timer maturation. These preprocessing methods are all encapsulated within the TockyPrep R package.
  Conclusions: TockyPrep is available for distribution via GitHub at https://github.com/MonoTockyLab/TockyPrep, providing tools for data preprocessing and basic visualization of Timer fluorescence data. This toolkit is expected to enhance the utility of experimental systems utilizing Fluorescent Timer proteins, including the Tocky tools.</description>

      <title>Data Filtering for Genetic Perturbation Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based data filtering as an alternative. Unlike active learning, data filtering selects the gene perturbations before training, meaning it is free of bias due to random initialization and initial random selection. Moreover, reducing the iterations between the wet lab and the model provides several operational advantages resulting in significant acceleration. The proposed methods are motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art. The results demonstrate that graph-based data filtering achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Correlated Mutation Type Probabilities for Mutational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Somatic mutations, or alterations in DNA of a somatic cell, are key markers of cancer. In recent years, mutational signature analysis has become a prominent field of study within cancer research, commonly with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Bayesian NMF. However, current methods assume independence across mutation types in the signatures matrix. This paper expands upon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account for the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the Bayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the signatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external information, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This model converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with independent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and results in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In addition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure of the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving the algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the dependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of biological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer. The code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package. Our work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency structure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable to any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of AI-assisted chemical synthesis tools requires comprehensive datasets covering diverse reaction types, yet current high-throughput experimental (HTE) approaches are expensive and limited in scope. Chemical literature represents a vast, underexplored data source containing thousands of reactions published annually. However, extracting reaction information from literature faces significant challenges including varied writing styles, complex coreference relationships, and multimodal information presentation. This paper proposes ChemMiner, a novel end-to-end framework leveraging multiple agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract high-fidelity chemical data from literature. ChemMiner incorporates three specialized agents: a text analysis agent for coreference mapping, a multimodal agent for non-textual information extraction, and a synthesis analysis agent for data generation. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark with expert-annotated chemical literature to evaluate both extraction efficiency and precision. Experimental results demonstrate reaction identification rates comparable to human chemists while significantly reducing processing time, with high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Our open-sourced benchmark facilitates future research in chemical literature data mining.</description>

Abstract: Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</description>

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research.

      <title>A universal hydrodynamic transition in confined marine invertebrate larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Functional Correspondences in the Human and Marmoset Visual Cortex During Movie Watching: Insights from Correlation, Redundancy, and Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. In this study, to investigate their functional correspondences, we used 13 healthy human volunteers (9 males and 4 females, aged 22-56 years) and 8 common marmosets (6 males and 2 females, aged 20-42 months). We then measured pairwise and beyond-pairwise correlations, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. First, we consistently observed a high degree of functional similarity in visual processing within and between species, suggesting that integrative processing mechanisms are preserved in both humans and marmosets, despite potential differences in their specific activity patterns. Second, we found that the strongest functional correspondences during movie watching occurred between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal high-level visual regions in the marmoset, reflecting a synergistic functional relationship. This suggests that these regions share complementary and integrated patterns of information processing across species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.</description>

      <title>Scalable Non-Equivariant 3D Molecule Generation via Rotational Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency.

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>
