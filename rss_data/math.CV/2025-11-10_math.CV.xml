      <title>On anti-hyperbolicity for hyperk\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By restricting to (a linear subspace of) an affine chart in projective space, a complex stably rational or unirational manifold of dimension $m$ is meromorphically dominable by $\mathbb C^m$, i.e., admits a meromorphic dominating map from $\mathbb C^m$. So are varieties that are birational to abelian varieties and Kummer K3 surfaces. G. Buzzard and the second author have shown that elliptic K3 surfaces are holomorphically dominable by $\mathbb C^2$, i.e. admitting a holomorphic map with nontrivial Jacobian. In this paper we explore various examples and criteria for meromorphic and holomorphic dominability by $\mathbb C^m$ of certain hyperk\"ahler manifolds, generalizing some known results about K3 surfaces. Anti-hyperbolicity has several interpretations in the sense of vanishing of the Kobayashi-Royden metrics, admitting dense entire holomorphic curves, or dominating holomorphic or meromorphic maps from the complex affine space of the same dimension.</description>

      <title>A manifold Fueter-Sce phenomenon in one hypercomplex variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueter's theorem states, in modern terms, that the Laplacian maps slice-regular quaternionic functions into Fueter-regular functions with axial symmetry. This phenomenon is also present in the Clifford setting, where both slice-monogenic functions and generalized partial-slice monogenic are mapped by the Laplacian into monogenic functions with axial symmetry. These results are due, respectively, to Sce and Qian and to Xu and Sabadini.
  The present work puts the Fueter-Sce phenomenon into context for the wider class of strongly $T$-regular functions. It shows that the phenomenon appears over general associative $*$-algebras. Moreover, the symmetry considered here is multi-axial in a sense introduced by Eelbode. Additionally, but more surprisingly, the phenomenon studied by Fueter, Sce, Xu and Sabadini turns out to be the last step in a multi-step process. A new phenomenon in one hypercomplex variable is therefore discovered.</description>

      <title>Besov-Bergman spaces of $M$-harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We~show that the weighted Bergman spaces of M-harmonic functions (functions annihilated by the invariant Laplacian on the unit ball of the complex n-space), as~well as their analytic continuation (in~the spirit of Rossi and Vergne), coincide with the certain Besov-type spaces, which were studied by Folland. Characterizations in terms of tangential derivatives are given, and for appropriate values of the weight parameter, these spaces are also shown to coincide with the subspaces of all M-harmonic fucntions in the Sobolev space of order~$t$ on the~ball, $0\le t\le n$. Unlike the holomorphic case, the~last result is shown to fail in general for other values of~$t$. The~main tool in the proofs are asymptotic estimates for certain integrals of squared hypergeometric functions, which seem to be of interest in their own right and may find other applications.</description>

      <title>On the pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian derivatives of log-harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce definitions of the pre-Schwarzian and the Schwarzian derivatives for any locally univalent log-harmonic mappings defined in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|&lt;1\}$. We explore the properties and applications of these concepts in the context of geometric function theory, and we also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a non-vanishing log-harmonic mapping having a finite pre-Schwarzian norm. Additionally, we establish a relationship between the pre-Schwarzian norm of a non-vanishing log-harmonic mapping and that of a certain analytic function in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>Pairs of Clark Unitary Operators on the Bidisk and their Taylor Joint Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Clark theory for commuting compressed shift operators on model spaces $K_{\phi}$ associated with inner functions $\phi$ on the bidisk, which exhibits both similarities and marked differences compared to the classical one-variable version. We first identify the adjoint of the embedding operator $J_{\alpha} \colon K_{\phi}\to L^2(\sigma_{\alpha})$ as a weighted Cauchy transform of the Clark measure $\sigma_{\alpha}$. Under natural assumptions, which generically include the case when $\phi$ is rational inner, we then use $J_{\alpha}^*$ to obtain commuting unitaries on $K_{\phi}$ which are often infinite-dimensional perturbations of compressed shift operators. Finally, we show that the Taylor joint spectrum of these Clark unitaries coincides with $\mathrm{supp}(\sigma_{\alpha})\subset \mathbb{T}^2$ when $\phi$ is a rational inner function.</description>

      <title>Envelope of truncated tubes and special domains in higher complex dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce special domains and discuss the geometry of these domains, which includes showing that every pseudoconvex truncated tube domain is a special domain. Next, we prove a theorem for the envelope of special domains in $\C^n ~(n\geq 2)$. Our theorem on special domains is a generalization of a recent result by Jarnicki-Pflug on the envelope of holomorphy of truncated tube domains in $\C^n$. We also establish a result on schlichtness in complex dimension 2, and conclude this article with two higher-dimensional generalizations of the same result by Jarnicki-Pflug mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness theorem for completely non-degenerate B-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a completely non-degenerate B-group is uniquely determined by its factor: two such groups with conformally equivalent factors are M\"obius conjugate. A similar property is inherent to the quasi-Fuchsian groups but not to degenerate B-groups. We also study the factor of a B-group as a triple: the main factor, the marked characteristic complex, and a homotopy class of maps of the first to the second one.</description>

      <title>Duality, polarity and convolution in umbral calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit foundations of umbral calculus using a straightforward approach based on an explicit matrix realization of binomial convolution. We construct an umbral duality of Wronskian type for rational curves in echelon form, and connect it with an umbral version of the polarity pairing. Then we extend additive convolution to the umbral setting and provide an explicit inversion formula for the corresponding deviation terms. This enables us to derive analogs of Grace and Walsh representation theorems for finite differences.</description>
