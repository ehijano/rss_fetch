      <title>Escalation dynamics and the severity of wars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although very large wars remain an enduring threat in global politics, we lack a clear understanding of how some wars become large and costly, while most do not. There are three possibilities: large conflicts start with and maintain intense fighting, they persist over a long duration, or they escalate in intensity over time. Using detailed within-conflict data on civil and interstate wars 1946--2008, we show that escalation dynamics -- variations in fighting intensity within an armed conflict -- play a fundamental role in producing large conflicts and are a generic feature of both civil and interstate wars. However, civil wars tend to deescalate when they become very large, limiting their overall severity, while interstate wars exhibit a persistent risk of continual escalation. A non-parametric model demonstrates that this distinction in escalation dynamics can explain the differences in the historical sizes of civil vs. interstate wars, and explain Richardson's Law governing the frequency and severity of interstate conflicts over the past 200 years. Escalation dynamics also drive enormous uncertainty in forecasting the eventual sizes of both hypothetical and ongoing civil wars, indicating a need to better understand the causes of escalation and deescalation within conflicts. The close relationship between the size, and hence the cost, of an armed conflict and its potential for escalation has broad implications for theories of conflict onset or termination and for risk assessment in international relations.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Applying Smarta to the analysis of tourist networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of the present study was the destination life cycle model, a classical model that describes the development of tourist destinations. We examined mass tourism in Benidorm based on tourist accommodation supply and demand statistics over the January 2016 - October 2018 period, provided by Spain's National Institute for Statistics. The objective was to analyze the life cycle and competitiveness of Benidorm's tourism system, interpret whether the tourism product was sustainable, and at what stage in the cycle Benidorm is currently in. To do this, we used Smarta software, which, based on network analysis, enables to interpret the system's virtuous cycles and analyze causality by observing relationship patterns in the system's attractors, thus complementing typical processing based on causal maps and the study of social networks. The results obtained by this application (which has been developed by our research team), show 6 sets of attractors that mark the trends of the tourist system. Finally, the analysis of the significant variables of these attractors have helped to justify that the tourist system of Benidorm is in the rejuvenation phase.</description>

      <title>Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite networks appear in many real-world contexts, linking entities across two distinct sets. They are often analyzed via one-mode projections, but such projections can introduce artificial correlations and inflated clustering, obscuring the true underlying structure. In this paper, we propose a geometric model for bipartite networks that leverages the high levels of bipartite four-cycles as a measure of clustering to place both node types in the same similarity space, where link probabilities decrease with distance. Additionally, we introduce B-Mercator, an algorithm that infers node positions from the bipartite structure. We evaluate its performance on diverse datasets, illustrating how the resulting embeddings improve downstream tasks such as node classification and distance-based link prediction in machine learning. These hyperbolic embeddings also enable the generation of synthetic networks with node features closely resembling real-world ones, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while allowing secure data sharing. In addition, we show how preserving bipartite structure avoids the pitfalls of projection-based techniques, yielding more accurate descriptions and better performance. Our method provides a robust framework for uncovering hidden geometry in complex bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Robust design of bicycle infrastructure networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promoting active mobility like cycling relies on the availability of well-connected, high-quality bicycle networks. However, expanding these networks over an extended planning horizon presents one of the most complex challenges in transport science. This complexity arises from the intricate interactions between infrastructure availability and usage, such as network spillover effects and mode choice substitutions. In this paper, we approach the problem from two perspectives: direct optimization methods, which generate near-optimal solutions using operations research techniques, and conceptual heuristics, which offer intuitive and scalable algorithms grounded in network science. Specifically, we compare direct welfare optimization with an inverse network percolation approach to planning cycle superhighway extensions in Copenhagen. Interestingly, while the more complex optimization models yield better overall welfare results, the improvements over simpler methods are small. More importantly, we demonstrate that the increased complexity of planning approaches generally makes them more vulnerable to input uncertainty, reflecting the bias-variance tradeoff. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of long-term planning, where conditions change during the implementation of the planned infrastructure expansions. Therefore, while planning bicycle infrastructure is important and renders exceptionally high benefit-cost ratios, considerations of robustness and ease of implementation may justify the use of more straightforward network-based methods.</description>

      <title>Social Imitation Dynamics of Vaccination Driven by Vaccine Effectiveness and Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Declines in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, have enabled their surprising comebacks and pose significant public health challenges in the wake of growing vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify the impact of competing beliefs -- vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral -- on social imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed, or coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease dynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they base their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and social influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed vaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma, making the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in individuals' perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However, in scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination behavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment between vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of vaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt changes in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios without beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social contagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.</description>

      <title>Urban highways are barriers to social ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban highways are common, especially in the US, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the unprecedented granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a new dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.</description>

      <title>Epidemic paradox induced by awareness driven network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stationary epidemic processes in scale-free networks with local awareness behavior adopted by only susceptible, only infected, or all nodes. We find that while the epidemic size in the susceptible-aware and the all-aware models scales linearly with the network size, the scaling becomes sublinear in the infected-aware model. Hence, fewer aware nodes may reduce the epidemic size more effectively; a phenomenon reminiscent of Braess's paradox. We present numerical and theoretical analysis, and highlight the role of influential nodes and their disassortativity to raise epidemic awareness.</description>
