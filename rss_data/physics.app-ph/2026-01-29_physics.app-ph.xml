      <title>Non-Local Metasurface-aided Leaky-Wave Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a non-local terahertz metasurface integrated into a leaky-wave antenna for robust, wide-angle beam steering. The metasurface encodes a holographic pattern by explicitly inducing tangential and normal susceptibilities, along with magnetoelectric coupling. This design maintains stable radiation performance even when the longitudinal wavenumber of the incident guided mode - and thus its effective impinging angle - varies as a function of frequency. In particular, we show that there exists a limit to achieving exact angular insensitivity and propose an optimization-based framework to obtain the required susceptibilities that closely approximate near angle-insensitive performance for stable beam-steering performance. Additionally, an iterative synthesis approach is introduced that maps abstract susceptibilities to physically realizable structures. Full-wave simulations demonstrate a beam-scanning range of nearly 50 degrees over the 2.0-2.7 THz band - a more than threefold improvement over conventional local-metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Integrated laser heating stage with active geometry modulation for simultaneous in-situ X-ray transmission and evolved gas analysis of molten liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and development of a compact, integrated laser heating stage tailored for in situ high-temperature X ray transmission studies of molten oxides. In horizontal beam geometries, widely used in both laboratory and synchrotron facilities, the natural spreading (wetting) of molten samples on substrates significantly reduces the effective vertical optical path length, detrimental to signal quality in transmission-mode measurements. To overcome this limitation, we introduced a thermocouple assisted active geometry modulation technique. This method mechanically lifts the spreading melt into a liquid bridge via surface tension, optimizing the transmission path length while simultaneously enabling in situ temperature monitoring. The device features a triple fiber coupled laser head with high power density, a precision closed loop Proportional Integral Derivative temperature control system, and an atmosphere controlled vacuum chamber coupled with a mass spectrometer. This integration allows for simultaneous evolved gas analysis, enabling the correlation of structural phase transitions with chemical volatilization or reaction dynamics. Validated by tracking the melting kinetics of a multicomponent glass precursor, this versatile setup provides a comprehensive solution for high quality data acquisition in X ray transmission experiments across various sources.</description>

      <title>Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.</description>

      <title>Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Consistent Bounds on Information Transfer in Real-World RIS-Parametrized Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) endows a wireless channel with programmability that can be leveraged to optimize wireless information transfer. While many works study algorithms for optimizing such a programmable channel, relatively little is known about fundamental bounds on the achievable information transfer. In particular, non-trivial bounds that are both electromagnetically consistent (e.g., aware of mutual coupling) and in line with realistic hardware constraints (e.g., few-bit-programmable, potentially lossy loads) are missing. Here, based on a rigorous multiport network model of a single-input single-output (SISO) channel parametrized by 1-bit-programmable RIS elements, we apply a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to derive a fundamental bound on the achievable SISO channel gain enhancement. A bound on the maximum achievable rate of information transfer at a given noise level follows directly from Shannon's theorem. We apply our bound to several numerical and experimental examples of different RIS-parametrized radio environments. Compared to electromagnetically consistent benchmark bounding strategies (a norm-inequality bound and, where applicable, a relaxation to an idealized beyond-diagonal load network for which a global solution exists), we consistently observe that our SDR-based bound is notably tighter. We reach at least 64 % (but often 100 %) of our SDR-based bound with standard discrete optimization techniques. The applicability of our bound to concrete experimental systems makes it valuable to inform wireless practitioners, e.g., to evaluate RIS hardware design choices and algorithms to optimize the RIS configuration. Our work contributes to the development of an electromagnetic information theory for RIS-parametrized channels as well as other programmable wave systems such as dynamic metasurface antennas or real-life beyond-diagonal RISs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Order Diffraction Suppression in Full Field-of-View Computer Generated Holography: A Camera In the Loop Interferometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel interferometric approach for suppressing zero-order diffraction (ZOD) in phase-only computer-generated holography. The technique relies on the destructive interference between the zeroth-order light and a suppression beam in a plane optically conjugated to the spatial light modulator (SLM). A camera-in-the-loop (CITL) calibration procedure retrieves the optimal pixel-wise phase map that cancels out the ZOD component with high precision, while preserving the full modulation depth of the SLM. Experimental demonstrations on point-cloud and 2D/3D holograms achieve up to 99% suppression of the ZOD intensity, without loss of image quality or field of view. Once calibrated, the correction can be applied to any hologram without recomputation, enabling real-time operation and robust performance over time. This method removes a long-standing barrier to the practical deployment of full-field holography, facilitating the development of compact, high-fidelity holographic engines for augmented and mixed reality displays.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Modulation in Polycrystalline Barium Titanate Metasurfaces Enhanced by Poling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable metasurfaces leveraging the strong Pockel's effect in barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$ or BTO) are a promising platform for reconfigurable free-space optical devices. However, the high cost, limited scalability, and restricted substrate compatibility of epitaxial BTO films hinder its exploitation. Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations. This enhanced EO response, arising from the effective permittivity engineering and domain orientation in these polycrystalline metasurfaces, holds significant potential for scalable and efficient EO modulators and active metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Engineering Spatial Dispersion to Synthesize Arbitrary Spatial Filters Based on Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a design framework for synthesizing angularly selective spatial filters using non-uniform metagratings. While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$% -wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We also study magneto-optical conductivity, magnetic circular dichroism and Friedel oscillations in the $X$-wave magnets. Various analytic formulas are derived in the case of two-band Hamiltonians. This paper presents a review of recent progress together with some original results.</description>
