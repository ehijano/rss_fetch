      <title>Spatio-Temporal Performance of 2D Local Inertial Hydrodynamic Models for Urban Drainage and Dam-Break Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate flood modeling is crucial for effective analysis and forecasting. Full momentum hydrodynamic models often require extensive computational time, sometimes exceeding the forecast horizon. In contrast, low-complexity models, like local-inertial approximations, provide accurate results in subcritical flows but may have limited skillfulness in supercritical conditions. This paper explores two main aspects: (i) the impact of urban infrastructure on 2D hydrodynamic modeling without detailed sewer and drainage data, and (ii) the accuracy of 2D local-inertial modeling using three numerical schemes (original formulation, s-centered, and s-upwind) in a dam-break scenario on complex, flat terrain. The HydroPol2D model is benchmarked against HEC-RAS 2D full momentum solver. We present one numerical case study and three real-world scenarios in S\~ao Paulo, Brazil: a detention pond with a $1$ in $100$-year inflow, a highly urbanized catchment with a $1$ in $50$-year hyetograph, and a dam-break scenario threatening a coastal city of nearly 200,000 residents. Results show that the model accurately simulates internal boundary conditions, achieving peak errors under 5\% compared to HEC-RAS 2D. However, neglecting urban infrastructure can lead to a 17.5\% difference in peak discharges at the outlet and significant mismatches in hydrographs, with computational times nearly doubling. The dam-break scenario demonstrates good predictive performance for maximum flood depths (CSI = $0.95$ for the original model, $0.92$ for s-centered, and $0.89$ for s-upwind), though the model's lack of convective inertia results in faster flood wave propagation than the full momentum solver. Notably, HydroPol2D is 23 times faster than HEC-RAS 2D, making it well-suited for simulating dam collapses in forecasting systems and capable of modeling urban drainage infrastructure such as orifices, weirs, and pumps.</description>

      <title>3-D Magnetotelluric Deep Learning Inversion Guided by Pseudo-Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric deep learning (DL) inversion methods based on joint data-driven and physics-driven have become a hot topic in recent years. When mapping observation data (or forward modeling data) to the resistivity model using neural networks (NNs), incorporating the error (loss) term of the inversion resistivity's forward modeling response--which introduces physical information about electromagnetic field propagation--can significantly enhance the inversion accuracy. To efficiently achieve data-physical dual-driven MT deep learning inversion for large-scale 3-D MT data, we propose using DL forward modeling networks to compute this portion of the loss. This approach introduces pseudo-physical information through the forward modeling of NN simulation, further guiding the inversion network fitting. Specifically, we first pre-train the forward modeling networks as fixed forward modeling operators, then transfer and integrate them into the inversion network training, and finally optimize the inversion network by minimizing the multinomial loss. Theoretical experimental results indicate that despite some simulation errors in DL forward modeling, the introduced pseudo-physical information still enhances inversion accuracy and significantly mitigates the overfitting problem during training. Additionally, we propose a new input mode that involves masking and adding noise to the data, simulating the field data environment of 3-D MT inversion, thereby making the method more flexible and effective for practical applications.</description>

      <title>X-Raying Neutral Density Disturbances in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere induced by the 2022 Hunga-Tonga Volcano Eruption-Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray observations of the upper atmospheric density disturbance caused by the explosive eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano on 15 January 2022. From 14 January to 16 January, the Chinese X-ray astronomy satellite, Insight-HXMT, was observing the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The X-ray data obtained during Earth's atmospheric occultations allowed us to measure neutral densities in the altitude range of ~90-150 km. The density profiles above 110 km altitude obtained before the major eruption are in reasonable agreement with expectations by both GAIA and NRLMSIS 2.0 models. In contrast, after the HTHH eruption, a severe density depletion was found up to ~1,000 km away from the epicenter, and a relatively weak depletion extending up to ~7,000 km for over 8 hr after the eruption. In addition, density profiles showed wavy structures with a typical length scale of either ~20 km (vertical) or ~1,000 km (horizontal). This may be caused by Lamb waves or gravity waves triggered by the volcanic eruption.</description>

      <title>Relationships of Earthquake Moment Magnitude with Body and Surface Waves Using MCMC Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the saturation of the body ($m_b$) and surface ($M_S$) earthquake magnitudes, the moment magnitude ($M_W$) is a more convenient parameter for representing earthquake energies. We use the HRVD data, including 18,569 earthquakes recorded from 1976 January 1 to 2010 December 31, for five regions on the Earth (\textbf{Asia}-Oceania, Europe, Africa, North America, and South America). Applying the error propagation technique on the moment tensor, we estimate the standard error for $M_W$ showing a distribution that deviates from Gaussian errors which recommends using the Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) to obtain model parameters instead of the least square approach. We investigate the linear relationship between the body and surface waves in small ($\le$ 6.1) and large ($&gt;$6.1) magnitudes via MCMC. The slope varies from 0.811 to 1.565 ($m_b - M_W$) and 0.566 to 0.971 ($M_S - M_W$) across five regions. For 18,569 global earthquakes, we obtained the slope for $m_b \le 6.1$ ($m_b&gt;$6.1) 0.863 (1.374), while we find the slope for $M_S\le$6.1 ($M_S &gt;$ 6.1) 0.581 (0.921). These transition relationships of the magnitude moments are useful for increasing earthquake monitoring capacity.</description>

      <title>The Second Law of Thermodynamics, Life and Earth's Planetary Machinery Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life is a planetary feature that depends on its environment, but it has also strongly shaped the physical conditions on Earth, having created conditions highly suitable for a productive biosphere. Clearly, the second law of thermodynamics must apply to these dynamics as well, but how? What insights can we gain by placing life and its effects on planetary functioning in the context of the second law? In Kleidon (2010), I described a thermodynamic Earth system perspective by placing the functioning of the Earth system in terms of the second law. The Earth system is represented by a planetary hierarchy of energy transformations that are driven predominantly by incoming solar radiation, these transformations are constrained by the second law, but they are also modified by the feedbacks from various dissipative activities. It was then hypothesised that life evolves its dissipative activity to the limits imposed by this hierarchy and evolves feedbacks aimed at pushing these limits to higher levels of dissipative activity. Here I provide an update of this perspective. I first review applications to climate and global climate change to demonstrate its success in predicting magnitudes of physical processes, particularly regarding temperatures, heat redistribution and hydrological cycling. I then focus on the limits to dissipative activity of the biosphere. It would seem that the limitations by thermodynamics act indirectly by imposing limitations associated with transport and material exchange. I substantiate this interpretation and discuss the broader implications for habitability, the emergence and evolution of life, and the contemporary biosphere.</description>

      <title>Groningen: Spatial Prediction of Rock Gas Saturation by Leveraging Selected and Augmented Well and Seismic Data with Classifier Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of concept for spatial prediction of rock saturation probability using classifier ensemble methods on the example of the giant Groningen gas field. The stages of generating 1481 seismic field attributes and selecting 63 significant attributes are described. The effectiveness of the proposed method of augmentation of well and seismic data is shown, which increased the training sample by 9 times. On a test sample of 42 wells (blind well test), the results demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the ensemble of classifiers: the Matthews correlation coefficient is 0.7689, and the F1-score for the "gas reservoir" class is 0.7949. Prediction of gas reservoir thicknesses within the field and adjacent areas is made.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables: A Spectral Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N$_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore: 22.52$^\circ$N, 75.92$^\circ$E, dip: 32.23$^\circ$N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad: 17.42$^\circ$N, 78.55$^\circ$E, dip: 21.69$^\circ$N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.</description>

      <title>Modeling groundwater levels in California's Central Valley by hierarchical Gaussian process and neural network regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling groundwater levels continuously across California's Central Valley (CV) hydrological system is challenging due to low-quality well data which is sparsely and noisily sampled across time and space. The lack of consistent well data makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of 2017 and 2019 wet years on CV groundwater following a severe drought during 2012-2015. A novel machine learning method is formulated for modeling groundwater levels by learning from a 3D lithological texture model of the CV aquifer. The proposed formulation performs multivariate regression by combining Gaussian processes (GP) and deep neural networks (DNN). The hierarchical modeling approach constitutes training the DNN to learn a lithologically informed latent space where non-parametric regression with GP is performed. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP-DNN regression for modeling non-stationary features in the well data with fast and reliable uncertainty quantification, as validated to be statistically consistent with the empirical data distribution from 90 blind wells across CV. We show how the model predictions may be used to supplement hydrological understanding of aquifer responses in basins with irregular well data. Our results indicate that on average the 2017 and 2019 wet years in California were largely ineffective in replenishing the groundwater loss caused during previous drought years.</description>

      <title>Reconciling aging and slip state evolutions from laboratory-derived canons of rate-and-state friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aging law and the slip law are two representative evolution laws of the rate- and state-dependent friction (RSF) law, based on canonical behaviors in three types of laboratory experiments: slide-hold-slide (SHS), velocity-step (VS), and steady-state (SS) tests. The aging law explains the SHS canon but contradicts the VS canon, and vice versa for the slip law. The later proposed composite law, which switches these two laws according to the slip rate $V$, explains both canons but contradicts the SS canon. The present study constructs evolution laws satisfying all three canons throughout the range of variables where experiments have confirmed the canons. By recompiling the three canons, we have derived constraints on the evolution law and find that the evolution rates in the strengthening phases of the SHS and VS canons are so different that complete reconciliation throughout the entire range of variables is mathematically impossible. However, for the limited range of variables probed by experiments so far, we have found that the SHS and VS canons can be reconciled without violating the SS canon by switching the evolution function according to $\Omega$, the ratio of the state $\theta$ to its steady-state value $\theta_{\rm SS}$ for the instantaneous slip rate. We could generally show that, as long as the state evolution rate $\dot \theta$ depends only on the instantaneous values of $V$ and $\theta$, simultaneous reproduction of the three canons, throughout the experimentally confirmed range, requires the aging-law-like evolution for $\Omega$ sufficiently below a threshold $\beta$ and the slip-law-like evolution for $\Omega$ sufficiently above $\beta$. The validity of the canons in existing experiments suggests $\beta \lesssim 0.01$.</description>
