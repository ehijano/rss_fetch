      <title>Multi- and Infinite-variate Integration and $L^2$-Approximation on Hilbert Spaces with Gaussian Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integration and $L^2$-approximation in the worst-case setting for deterministic linear algorithms based on function evaluations. The underlying function space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a Gaussian kernel of tensor product form. In the infinite-variate case, for both computational problems, we establish matching upper and lower bounds for the polynomial convergence rate of the $n$-th minimal error. In the multivariate case, we improve several tractability results for the integration problem. For the proofs, we establish the following transference result together with an explicit construction: Each of the computational problems on a space with a Gaussian kernel is equivalent on the level of algorithms to the same problem on a Hermite space with suitable parameters.</description>

      <title>Approximating Continuous Spectra of Hyperbolic Systems with Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to continuous spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By focusing on the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simulataneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by $p = 2, 3, 4$ and $5$. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth for ensuring numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We find that the continuous spectrum is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the continuous) is not obtained. However, we also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate discrete spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the discrete spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical schemes for a fully nonlinear coagulation-fragmentation model coming from wave kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel numerical approach for studying fully nonlinear coagulation-fragmentation models, where both the coagulation and fragmentation components of the collision operator are nonlinear. The model approximates the $3-$wave kinetic equations, a pivotal framework in wave turbulence theory governing the time evolution of wave spectra in weakly nonlinear systems. An implicit finite volume scheme (FVS) is derived to solve this equation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first numerical scheme capable of accurately capturing the long-term asymptotic behavior of solutions to a fully nonlinear coagulation-fragmentation model that includes both forward and backward energy cascades. The scheme is implemented on some test problems, demonstrating strong alignment with theoretical predictions of energy cascade rates. We further introduce a weighted FVS variant to ensure energy conservation across varying degrees of kernel homogeneity. Convergence and first-order consistency are established through theoretical analysis and verified by experimental convergence orders in test cases.</description>

      <title>Multilinear analysis of quaternion arrays: theory and computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\mathbb{H}\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-strong convergence orders of fully discrete schemes for the SPDE driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that for a stochastic differential equation driven by L\'evy noise, the temporal H\"older continuity in $L^p$ sense of the exact solution does not exceed $1/p$. This leads to that the $L^p$-strong convergence order of a numerical scheme will vanish as $p$ increases to infinity if the temporal H\"older continuity of the solution process is directly used. A natural question arises: can one obtain the $L^p$-strong convergence order that does not depend on $p$? In this paper, we provide a positive answer for fully discrete schemes of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by L\'evy noise. Two cases are considered: the first is the linear multiplicative Poisson noise with $\nu(\chi)&lt;\infty$ and the second is the additive Poisson noise with $\nu(\chi)\leq\infty$, where $\nu$ is the L\'evy measure and $\chi$ is the mark set. For the first case, we present a strategy by employing the jump-adapted time discretization, while for the second case, we introduce the approach based on the recently obtained L\^e's quantitative John--Nirenberg inequality. We show that proposed schemes converge in $L^p$ sense with orders almost $1/2$ in both space and time for all $p\ge2$, which contributes novel results in the numerical analysis of the SPDE driven by L\'evy noise.</description>

      <title>A Diffeomorphic Variable-Step Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to variable-step Finite Difference Method (FDM) where non-uniform meshes are generated via a weight function, which establishes a diffeomorphism between uniformly spaced computational coordinates and variably spaced physical coordinates. We then derive finite difference approximations for derivatives on variable meshes in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases, and discuss constraints on the weight function. To demonstrate efficacy, we apply the method to the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator, achieving improved eigenfunction resolution without increased computational cost.</description>

      <title>A bi-fidelity method for the uncertain Vlasov-Poisson system near quasineutrality in an asymptotic-preserving PIC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson system with massless electrons (VPME) near quasineutrality and with uncertainties. Based on the idea of reformulation on the Poisson equation by [P. Degond et.al., $\textit{Journal of Computational Physics}$, 229 (16), 2010, pp. 5630--5652], we first consider the deterministic problem and develop an efficient asymptotic-preserving particle-in-cell (AP-PIC) method to capture the quasineutral limit numerically, without resolving the discretizations subject to the small Debye length in plasma. The main challenge and difference compared to previous related works is that we consider the nonlinear Poisson in the VPME system which contains $e^{\phi}$ (with $\phi$ being the electric potential) and provide an explicit scheme. In the second part, we extend to study the uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem and develop an efficient bi-fidelity method for solving the VPME system with multidimensional random parameters, by choosing the Euler-Poisson equation as the low-fidelity model. Several numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the asymptotic-preserving property of our deterministic solver and the effectiveness of our bi-fidelity method for solving the model with random uncertainties.</description>

      <title>On an Analytical Inversion Formula for the Modulo Radon Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves a novel analytical inversion formula for the so-called modulo Radon transform (MRT), which models a recently proposed approach to one-shot high dynamic range tomography. It is based on the solution of a Poisson problem linking the Laplacian of the Radon transform (RT) of a function to its MRT in combination with the classical filtered back projection formula for inverting the RT. Discretizing the inversion formula using Fourier techniques leads to our novel Laplacian Modulo Unfolding - Filtered Back Projection algorithm, in short LMU-FBP, to recover a function from fully discrete MRT data. Our theoretical findings are finally supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation. Part I: Interpretable and Adaptive Discretization for Solving PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework, a sparse neural network architecture extending previous work on Embedded Finite Element Neural Networks (EFENN) introduced with the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN). Due to their mesh-based structure, EFENN requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks, with individual weights and biases having a clear interpretation.
  Our FENNI framework, within the EFENN framework, brings improvements to the HiDeNN approach. First, we propose a reference element-based architecture where shape functions are defined on a reference element, enabling variability in interpolation functions and straightforward use of Gaussian quadrature rules for evaluating the loss function. Second, we propose a pragmatic multigrid training strategy based on the framework's interpretability. Third, HiDeNN's combined rh-adaptivity is extended from 1D to 2D, with a new Jacobian-based criterion for adding nodes combining h- and r-adaptivity. From a deep learning perspective, adaptive mesh behavior through rh-adaptivity and the multigrid approach correspond to transfer learning, enabling FENNI to optimize the network's architecture dynamically during training.
  The framework's capabilities are demonstrated on 1D and 2D test cases, where its accuracy and computational cost are compared against an analytical solution and a classical FEM solver. On these cases, the multigrid training strategy drastically improves the training stage's efficiency and robustness. Finally, we introduce a variational loss within the EFENN framework, showing that it performs as well as energy-based losses and outperforms residual-based losses. This framework is extended to surrogate modeling over the parametric space in Part II.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extensions of the GD tensor inverse using the M-product. The aim of current research is threefold. In the first place, the tensor GD inverse under the M-product is introduced and considered. We give the several properties and representations of the GD inverse using the core nilpotent decomposition and then establish the reverse-order law rules for the GD inverse. Second, the tensor GDMP inverse is studied and the corresponding numerical algorithm is given. In addition, the reverse- and forward-order laws of the GDMP inverse are established. Third, the GD-Star tensor inverse under the M-product is introduced and studied. Finally, the GD inverse, GDMP inverse and GD-Star inverse solutions of multilinear equations are investigated. Illustrative numerical calculation is performed.</description>

      <title>Identifying an acoustic source in a two-layered medium from multi-frequency phased or phaseless far-field patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for reconstructing an acoustic source located in a two-layered medium from multi-frequency phased or phaseless far-field patterns measured on the upper hemisphere. The interface between the two media is assumed to be flat and infinite, while the source is buried in the lower half-space. In the phased case, a Fourier method is proposed to identify the source based on far-field measurements. This method assumes that the source is compactly supported and can be represented by a sum of Fourier basis functions. By utilizing the far-field patterns at different frequencies, the Fourier coefficients of the source can be determined, allowing for its reconstruction. For the case where phase information is unavailable, a phase retrieval formula is developed to retrieve the phase information. This formula exploits the fact that the far-field patterns are related to the source through a linear operator that preserves phase information. By developing a suitable phase retrieval algorithm, the phase information can be recovered. Once the phase is retrieved, the Fourier method can be adopted to recover the source function. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Recovering the sources in the stochastic wave equations from multi-frequency far-field patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse source scattering problems of recovering random sources for acoustic and elastic waves. The underlying sources are assumed to be random functions driven by an additive white noise. The inversion process aims to find the essential statistical characteristics of the mean and variance from the radiated random wave field at multiple frequencies. To this end, we propose a non-iterative algorithm by approximating the mean and variance via the truncated Fourier series. Then, the Fourier coefficients can be explicitly evaluated by sparse far-field measurements, resulting in an easy-to-implement and efficient approach for the reconstruction. Demonstrations with extensive numerical results are presented to corroborate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive aposteriori error estimates for fully discrete approximations to solutions of linear parabolic equations on the space-time domain. The space discretization uses finite element spaces, that are allowed to change in time. Our main tool is an appropriate adaptation of the elliptic reconstruction technique, introduced by Makridakis and Nochetto (2003). We derive novel optimal order aposteriori error estimates for the maximum-in-time and mean-square-in-space norm and the mean-square in space-time of the time-derivative norm.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Random Feature Method for Solving Multiphase Flow Problems of Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell collective migration plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological processes. In this work, we propose the Runge-Kutta random feature method to solve the nonlinear and strongly coupled multiphase flow problems of cells, in which the random feature method in space and the explicit Runge-Kutta method in time are utilized. Experiments indicate that this algorithm can effectively deal with time-dependent partial differential equations with strong nonlinearity, and achieve high accuracy both in space and time. Moreover, in order to improve computational efficiency and save computational resources, we choose to implement parallelization and non-automatic differentiation strategies in our simulations. We also provide error estimates for the Runge-Kutta random feature method, and a series of numerical experiments are shown to validate our method.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Optimal Least Squares: Inhomogeneous boundary conditions, and application with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct least squares formulations of PDEs with inhomogeneous essential boundary conditions, where boundary residuals are not measured in unpractical fractional Sobolev norms, but which formulations nevertheless are shown to yield a quasi-best approximations from the employed trial spaces. Dual norms do enter the least-squares functional, so that solving the least squares problem amounts to solving a saddle point or minimax problem. For finite element applications we construct uniformly stable finite element pairs, whereas for Machine Learning applications we employ adversarial networks.</description>

      <title>Randomized algorithms for streaming low-rank approximation in tree tensor network format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the tree tensor network Nystr\"om (TTNN), an algorithm that extends recent research on streamable tensor approximation, such as for Tucker and tensor-train formats, to the more general tree tensor network format, enabling a unified treatment of various existing methods. Our method retains the key features of the generalized Nystr\"om approximation for matrices, that is randomized, single-pass, streamable, and cost-effective. Additionally, the structure of the sketching allows for parallel implementation. We provide a deterministic error bound for the algorithm and, in the specific case of Gaussian dimension reduction maps, also a probabilistic one. We also introduce a sequential variant of the algorithm, referred to as sequential tree tensor network Nystr\"om (STTNN), which offers better performance for dense tensors. Furthermore, both algorithms are well-suited for the recompression or rounding of tensors in the tree tensor network format. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Fast construction of the discrete Green operator for a second order ordinary differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear second order differential equation y''= f with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. At the continuous level this problem is solvable using the Green function, and this technique has a counterpart on the discrete level. The discrete solution is represented via an application of a matrix -- the Green matrix -- to the discretised right-hand side, and we propose an algorithm for fast construction of the Green matrix. In particular, we discretise the original problem using the spectral collocation method based on the Chebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, and using the discrete cosine transformation we show that the corresponding Green matrix is fast to construct even for large number of collocation points/high polynomial degree. Furthermore, we show that the action of the discrete solution operator (Green matrix) to the corresponding right-hand side can be implemented in a matrix-free fashion.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Conformal variational discretisation of infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with gradient flow dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonconservative evolution problems describe irreversible processes and dissipative effects in a broad variety of phenomena. Such problems are often characterised by a conservative part, which can be modelled as a Hamiltonian term, and a nonconservative part, in the form of gradient flow dissipation. Traditional numerical approximations of this class of problem typically fail to retain the separation into conservative and nonconservative parts hence leading to unphysical solutions. In this work we propose a mixed variational method that gives a semi-discrete problem with the same geometric structure as the infinite-dimensional problem. As a consequence the conservation laws and the dissipative terms are retained. A priori convergence estimates on the solution are established. Numerical tests of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on the torus and on the sphere are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Finite Volume Method for Elastic Waves in Heterogeneous, Anisotropic and Fractured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of elastic wave propagation in the subsurface requires applicability to heterogeneous, anisotropic and discontinuous media, as well as support of free surface boundary conditions. Here we study the cell-centered finite volume method Multi-Point Stress Approximation with weak symmetry (MPSA-W) for solving the elastic wave equation. Finite volume methods are geometrically flexible, locally conserving and they are suitable for handling material discontinuities and anisotropies. For discretization in time we have utilized the Newmark method, thereby developing an MPSA-Newmark discretization for the elastic wave equation. An important aspect of this work is the integration of absorbing boundary conditions into the MPSA-Newmark method to limit possible boundary reflections.
  Verification of the MPSA-Newmark discretization is achieved through numerical convergence analyses in 3D relative to a known solution, demonstrating the expected convergence rates of order two in time and up to order two in space. With the inclusion of absorbing boundary conditions, the resulting discretization is verified by considering convergence in a quasi-1d setting, as well as through energy decay analyses for waves with various wave incidence angles. Lastly, the versatility of the MPSA-Newmark discretization is demonstrated through simulation examples of wave propagation in fractured, heterogeneous and transversely isotropic media.</description>

      <title>A split-step Active Flux method for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Flux is a modified Finite Volume method that evolves additional Degrees of Freedom for each cell that are located on the interface by a non-conservative method to compute high-order approximations to the numerical fluxes through the respective interface to evolve the cell-average in a conservative way. In this paper, we apply the method to the Vlasov-Poisson system describing the time evolution of the time-dependent distribution function of a collisionless plasma. In particular, we consider the evaluation of the flux integrals in higher dimensions. We propose a dimensional splitting and three types of formulations of the flux integral: a one-dimensional reconstruction of second order, a third-order reconstruction based on information along each dimension, and a third-order reconstruction based on a discrepancy formulation of the Active Flux method. Numerical results in 1D1V phase-space compare the properties of the various methods.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and randomized LU-Householder CholeskyQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on improving LU-CholeskyQR2 \cite{LUChol}. Compared to other deterministic and randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms, it does not require a sufficient condition on $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for the input tall-skinny matrix $X$, which ensures the algorithm's safety in most real-world applications. However, the Cholesky factorization step may break down when the $L$-factor after the LU factorization of $X$ is ill-conditioned. To address this, we construct a new algorithm, LU-Householder CholeskyQR2 (LHC2), which uses HouseholderQR to generate the upper-triangular factor, thereby avoiding numerical breakdown. Moreover, we utilize the latest sketching techniques to develop randomized versions of LHC: SLHC and SSLHC. We provide a rounding error analysis for these new algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our three new algorithms have better applicability and can handle a wider range of matrices compared to LU-CholeskyQR2. With the sketching technique, our randomized algorithms, SLHC2 and SSLHC3, show significant acceleration over LHC2. Additionally, SSLHC3, which employs multi-sketching, is more efficient than SLHC2 and exhibits better numerical stability. It is also robust as a randomized algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules for splines of high smoothness on uniformly refined triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify families of quadrature rules that are exact for sufficiently smooth spline spaces on uniformly refined triangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Given any symmetric quadrature rule on a triangle $T$ that is exact for polynomials of a specific degree $d$, we investigate if it remains exact for sufficiently smooth splines of the same degree $d$ defined on the Clough-Tocher 3-split or the (uniform) Powell-Sabin 6-split of $T$. We show that this is always true for $C^{2r-1}$ splines having degree $d=3r$ on the former split or $d=2r$ on the latter split, for any positive integer $r$. Our analysis is based on the representation of the considered spline spaces in terms of suitable simplex splines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a semi-discrete scheme to approximate solutions to the scalar LWR traffic model with spatially discontinuous flux, described by the equation $u_t+(k(x)u(1-u))_x=0$. This approach is based on the Lagrangian-Eulerian method proposed by E. Abreu, J. Francois, W. Lambert, and J. Perez [J. Comp. Appl. Math.406 (2022) 114011] for scalar conservation laws. We provide a convergence proof for our scheme, which relies on Kolmogorov-Riesz's $L^1$-compactness theorem. We also derive a non-uniform bound on the growth rate of the total variation for approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>Patient-specific prediction of glioblastoma growth via reduced order modeling and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBL) is one of the deadliest brain cancers in adults. The GBL cells invade the physical structures within the brain extracellular environment with patient-specific features. In this work, we propose a proof-of-concept for mathematical framework of precision oncology enabling rapid parameter estimation from neuroimaging data in clinical settings.
  The proposed diffuse interface model of GBL growth is informed by neuroimaging data, periodically collected in a clinical study from diagnosis to surgery and adjuvant treatment. We build a robust and efficient computational pipeline to aid clinical decision-making based on integrating model reduction techniques and neural networks. Patient specificity is captured through the segmentation of the magnetic resonance imaging into a computational replica of the patient brain, mimicking the brain microstructure by incorporating also the diffusion tensor imaging data.
  The full order model (FOM) is first discretized using the finite element method and later approximated by a reduced order model (ROM) adopting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Trained by clinical data, we finally use neural networks to map the parameter space of GBL evolution over time and to predict the patient-specific model parameters from the observed clinical evolution of the tumor mass.</description>

We review boundary conditions for both fixed and free boundary solutions and under what circumstances a sheet current may exist at the plasma-vacuum interface. We develop an efficient and accurate algorithm for computing the residual of these boundary conditions and use it to compute free boundary equilibria in the DESC code both in vacuum and at finite plasma beta, with and without sheet currents.</description>

      <title>Evolving Algebraic Multigrid Methods Using Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigrid methods despite being known to be asymptotically optimal algorithms, depend on the careful selection of their individual components for efficiency. Also, they are mostly restricted to standard cycle types like V-, F-, and W-cycles. We use grammar rules to generate arbitrary-shaped cycles, wherein the smoothers and their relaxation weights are chosen independently at each step within the cycle. We call this a flexible multigrid cycle. These flexible cycles are used in Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods with the help of grammar rules and optimized using genetic programming. The flexible AMG methods are implemented in the software library of hypre, and the programs are optimized separately for two cases: a standalone AMG solver for a 3D anisotropic problem and an AMG preconditioner with conjugate gradient for a multiphysics code. We observe that the optimized flexible cycles provide higher efficiency and better performance than the standard cycle types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the use of polyhedral discretizations for the solution of heat diffusion and elastodynamic problems in computer graphics. Polyhedral meshes are more natural for certain applications than pure triangular or quadrilateral meshes, which thus received significant interest as an alternative representation. We consider finite element methods using barycentric coordinates as basis functions and the modern virtual finite element approach. We evaluate them on a suite of classical graphics problems to understand their benefits and limitations compared to standard techniques on simplicial discretizations. Our analysis provides recommendations and a benchmark for developing polyhedral meshing techniques and corresponding analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>A subgradient splitting algorithm for optimization on nonpositively curved metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of the primal ingredients of convex optimization extend naturally from Euclidean to Hadamard spaces $\unicode{x2014}$ nonpositively curved metric spaces like Euclidean, Hilbert, and hyperbolic spaces, metric trees, and more general CAT(0) cubical complexes. Linear structure, however, and the duality theory it supports are absent. Nonetheless, we introduce a new type of subgradient for convex functions on Hadamard spaces, based on Busemann functions. This notion supports a splitting subgradient method with guaranteed complexity bounds. In particular, the algorithm solves $p$-mean problems in general Hadamard spaces: we illustrate by computing medians in BHV tree space.</description>

      <title>Speckle imaging with blind source separation and total variation deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with optical imaging in strongly diffusive environments. We consider a typical setting in optical coherence tomography where a sample is probed by a collection of wavefields produced by a laser and propagating through a microscope. We operate in a scenario where the illuminations are in a speckle regime, namely fully randomized. This occurs when the light propagates deep in highly heterogeneous media. State-of-the-art coherent techniques are based on the ballistic part of the wavefield, that is the fraction of the wave that propagates freely and decays exponentially fast. In a speckle regime, the ballistic field is negligible compared to the scattered field, which precludes the use of coherent methods and different approaches are needed. We propose a strategy based on blind source separation and total variation deconvolution to obtain images with diffraction-limited resolution. The source separation allows us to isolate the fields diffused by the different scatterers to be imaged, while the deconvolution exploits the speckle memory effect to estimate the distance between these scatterers. Our method is validated with numerical simulations and is shown to be effective not only for imaging discrete scatterers, but also continuous objects.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on symplectic integration of constrained mechanical systems via discretization maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new geometric procedure to construct symplectic methods for constrained mechanical systems is developed in this paper. The definition of a map coming from the notion of retraction maps allows to adapt the continuous problem to the discretization rule rather than viceversa. As a result, the constraint submanifold is exactly preserved by the symplectic discrete flow and the extension of these methods to the case of non-linear configuration spaces is doable.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation of Singular Functions by Series of Non-integer Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an algorithm for approximating functions of the form $f(x)=\int_{a}^{b} x^{\mu} \sigma(\mu) \, d \mu$ over $[0,1]$, where $\sigma(\mu)$ is some signed Radon measure, or, more generally, of the form $f(x) = &lt;\sigma(\mu),\, x^\mu&gt;$, where $\sigma(\mu)$ is some distribution supported on $[a,b]$, with $0 &lt;a &lt; b &lt; \infty$. One example from this class of functions is $x^c (\log{x})^m=(-1)^m &lt;\delta^{(m)}(\mu-c), \, x^\mu&gt;$, where $a\leq c \leq b$ and $m \geq 0$ is an integer. Given the desired accuracy $\epsilon$ and the values of $a$ and $b$, our method determines a priori a collection of non-integer powers $t_1$, $t_2$, $\ldots$, $t_N$, so that the functions are approximated by series of the form $f(x)\approx \sum_{j=1}^N c_j x^{t_j}$, and a set of collocation points $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_N$, such that the expansion coefficients can be found by collocating the function at these points. We prove that our method has a small uniform approximation error which is proportional to $\epsilon$ multiplied by some small constants, and that the number of singular powers and collocation points grows as $N=O(\log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass lumping and outlier removal strategies for complex geometries in isogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass lumping techniques are commonly employed in explicit time integration schemes for problems in structural dynamics and both avoid solving costly linear systems with the consistent mass matrix and increase the critical time step. In isogeometric analysis, the critical time step is constrained by so-called "outlier" frequencies, representing the inaccurate high frequency part of the spectrum. Removing or dampening these high frequencies is paramount for fast explicit solution techniques. In this work, we propose mass lumping and outlier removal techniques for nontrivial geometries, including multipatch and trimmed geometries. Our lumping strategies provably do not deteriorate (and often improve) the CFL condition of the original problem and are combined with deflation techniques to remove persistent outlier frequencies. Numerical experiments reveal the advantages of the method, especially for simulations covering large time spans where they may halve the number of iterations with little or no effect on the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Nonlocal Approximation to Manifold Poisson Models with Neumann Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of nonlocal models to approximate the Poisson model on manifolds with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, where the manifolds are assumed to be embedded in high dimensional Euclid spaces.
  In comparison to the existing nonlocal approximation of Poisson models with Neumann boundary, we optimize the truncation error of model by adding an augmented function involving the second order normal derivative along the $2\delta$ layer of boundary, with $2\delta$ be the nonlocal interaction horizon. The 2nd normal derivative is expressed as the difference between the interior Laplacian and the boundary Laplacian.
  The concentration of our paper is on the construction of nonlocal model, the well-posedness of model, and its second-order convergence rate to its local counterpart. The localization rate of our nonlocal model is currently optimal among all related works even for the case of high dimensional Euclid spaces.</description>

      <title>Randomized Nystr\"om approximation of non-negative self-adjoint operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized singular value decomposition (SVD) has become a popular approach to computing cheap, yet accurate, low-rank approximations to matrices due to its efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees. Recent work by Boull\'e and Townsend (FoCM, 2023) presents an infinite-dimensional analog of the randomized SVD to approximate Hilbert-Schmidt operators. However, many applications involve computing low-rank approximations to symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. In this setting, it is well-established that the randomized Nystr\"om approximation is usually preferred over the randomized SVD. This paper explores an infinite-dimensional analog of the Nystr\"om approximation to compute low-rank approximations to non-negative self-adjoint trace-class operators. We present an analysis of the method and, along the way, improve the existing infinite-dimensional bounds for the randomized SVD. Our analysis yields bounds on the expected value and tail bounds for the Nystr\"om approximation error in the operator, trace, and Hilbert-Schmidt norms. Numerical experiments on integral operators arising from Gaussian process sampling and Bayesian inverse problems are used to validate the proposed infinite-dimensional Nystr\"om algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the error when solving a system of differential algebraic equations. Richardson extrapolation is a classical technique that can be used to judge when computational errors are irrelevant and estimate the discretization error. We have simulated molecular dynamics with constraints using the GROMACS library and found that the output is not always amenable to Richardson extrapolation. We derive and illustrate Richardson extrapolation using a variety of numerical experiments. We identify two necessary conditions that are not always satisfied by the GROMACS library.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an energy-based model, which seems especially suited for constrained systems. The proposed model provides an alternative to the popular port-Hamiltonian framework and exhibits similar properties such as energy dissipation as well as structure-preserving interconnection and Petrov-Galerkin projection. In terms of time discretization, the midpoint rule and discrete gradient methods are dissipation-preserving. Besides the verification of these properties, we present ten examples from different fields of application.</description>

      <title>A narrow band finite element method for the level set equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite element method is introduced to track interface evolution governed by the level set equation. The method solves for the level set indicator function in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element $L^2$- or $H^1$-projection combined with the ghost-penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a BDF time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fictitious null spaces for improving the solution of injective inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For linear ill-posed problems with nontrivial null spaces, Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) typically yield solutions that are close to the minimum norm solution. Such a bias is not always desirable, and we have therefore in a series of papers developed a weighting procedure which produces solutions with a different and controlled bias. This methodology can also conveniently be invoked when sparsity regularization is employed.
  The purpose of the present work is to study the potential use of this weighting applied to injective operators. The image under a compact operator of the singular vectors/functions associated with very small singular values will be almost zero. Consequently, one may regard these singular vectors/functions to constitute a basis for a fictitious null space that allows us to mimic the previous weighting procedure. It turns out that this regularization by weighting can improve the solution of injective inverse problems compared with more traditional approaches.
  We present some analysis of this methodology and exemplify it numerically, using sparsity regularization, for three PDE-driven inverse problems: the inverse heat conduction problem, the Cauchy problem for Laplace's equation, and the (linearized) Electrical Impedance Tomography problem with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to applying data assimilation techniques for particle-based simulations using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. While data assimilation methods have been effectively applied to Eulerian simulations, their application in Lagrangian solution discretizations has not been properly explored. We introduce two specific methodologies to address this gap. The first methodology employs an intermediary Eulerian transformation that combines a projection with a remeshing process. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme designed for situations where remeshing is not appropriate. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme that is applicable when remeshing is not adapted. These methods are evaluated using a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model with periodic boundaries. Performance benchmarks for the one-dimensional scenario are conducted against a grid-based assimilation filter Subsequently, assimilation schemes are applied to a non-linear two-dimensional incompressible flow problem, solved via the Vortex-In-Cell method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying these methods in more complex scenarios, highlighting their effectiveness in both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional contexts.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends deterministic notions of Strong Stability Preservation (SSP) to the stochastic setting, enabling nonlinearly stable numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with pathwise solutions that remain unconditionally bounded.

      <title>Introducing a Harmonic Balance Navier-Stokes Finite Element Solver to Accelerate Cardiovascular Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of cardiovascular simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning on a patient-specific basis requires the development of faster methods than the existing state-of-the-art techniques. To address this need, we leverage the periodic nature of these flows to accurately capture their time-dependence using spectral discretization. Owing to the reduced size of the discrete problem, the resulting approach, known as the harmonic balance method, significantly lowers the solution cost when compared against the conventional time marching methods. This study describes a stabilized finite element implementation of the harmonic balanced method that targets the simulation of physically-stable time-periodic flows. That stabilized method is based on the Galerkin/least-squares formulation that permits stable solution in convection-dominant flows and convenient use of the same interpolation functions for velocity and pressure. We test this solver against its equivalent time marching method using three common physiological cases where blood flow is modeled in a Glenn operation, a cerebral artery, and a left main coronary artery. Using the conventional time marching solver, simulating these cases takes more than ten hours. That cost is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude when the proposed harmonic balance solver is utilized, where a solution is produced in approximately 30 minutes. We show that that solution is in excellent agreement with the conventional solvers when the number of modes is sufficiently large to accurately represent the imposed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method Based on Flux Vector Splitting with Constrained Optimization-based TVB(D)-minmod Limiter for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux vector splitting (FVS) method has firstly been incorporated into the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for reconstructing the numerical fluxes required for the spatial semi-discrete formulation, setting it apart from the conventional DG approaches that typically utilize the Lax-Friedrichs flux scheme or classical Riemann solvers. The control equations of hyperbolic conservation systems are initially reformulated into a flux-split form. Subsequently, a variational approach is applied to this flux-split form, from which a DG spatial semi-discrete scheme based on FVS is derived. In order to suppress numerical pseudo-oscillations, the smoothness measurement function IS from the WENO limiter is integrated into the TVB(D)-minmod limiter, constructing an optimization problem based on the smoothness factor constraint, thereby realizing a TVB(D)-minmod limiter applicable to arbitrary high-order polynomial approximation. Subsequently, drawing on the ``reconstructed polynomial and the original high-order scheme's L2 -error constraint'' from the literature [1] , combined with our smoothness factor constraint, a bi-objective optimization problem is formulated to enable the TVB(D)-minmod limiter to balance oscillation suppression and high precision. As for hyperbolic conservation systems, limiters are typically required to be used in conjunction with local characteristic decomposition. To transform polynomials from the physical space to the characteristic space, an interpolation-based characteristic transformation scheme has been proposed, and its equivalence with the original moment characteristic transformation has been demonstrated in one-dimensional scenarios. Finally, the concept of ``flux vector splitting based on Jacobian eigenvalue decomposition'' has been applied to the conservative linear scalar transport equations and the nonlinear Burgers' equation.</description>

Abstract: Given a set of scattered points on a regular or irregular 2D polygon, we aim to employ them as quadrature points to construct a quadrature rule that establishes Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequalities on this polygon. The quadrature construction is aided by Bernstein--B\'{e}zier polynomials. For this purpose, we first propose a quadrature rule on triangles with an arbitrary degree of exactness and establish Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund estimates for 3-, 10-, and 21-point quadrature rules on triangles. Based on the 3-point quadrature rule on triangles, we then propose the desired quadrature rule on the polygon that satisfies Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequalities for $1\leq p \leq \infty$. As a byproduct, we provide error analysis for both quadrature rules on triangles and polygons. Numerical results further validate our construction.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>GD-VAEs: Geometric Dynamic Variational Autoencoders for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics and Dimension Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) represents a real scalar polynomial of degree $d$ using a product of unitary matrices of size $2\times 2$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers called the phase factors. This innovative representation of polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial series, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined limit as the degree $d\to \infty$. While the phase factors are generally not unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so that the limit is well defined in the $\ell^1$ space. This generalization of QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\ell^1$ space. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and provably converges when the $\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the target function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of $d$. This is also the first numerically stable algorithm for finding phase factors with provable performance guarantees in the limit $d\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting DeepFool: generalization and improvement</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions. This has led to a significant amount of research on evaluating the robustness of these networks against such perturbations. One particularly important robustness metric is the robustness to minimal $\ell_2$ adversarial perturbations. However, existing methods for evaluating this robustness metric are either computationally expensive or not very accurate. In this paper, we introduce a new family of adversarial attacks that strike a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are generalizations of the well-known DeepFool (DF) attack, while they remain simple to understand and implement. We demonstrate that our attacks outperform existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are also suitable for evaluating the robustness of large models and can be used to perform adversarial training (AT) to achieve state-of-the-art robustness to minimal $\ell_2$ adversarial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Challenges of learning multi-scale dynamics with AI weather models: Implications for stability and one solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term stability and physical consistency are critical properties for AI-based weather models if they are going to be used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts or beyond, e.g., climate change projection. However, current AI-based weather models can only provide short-term forecasts accurately since they become unstable or physically inconsistent when time-integrated beyond a few weeks or a few months. Either they exhibit numerical blow-up or hallucinate unrealistic dynamics of the atmospheric variables, akin to the current class of autoregressive large language models. The cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory. In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein, \textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based time-integrators amplify this bias, leading to unstable error propagation. Finally, using the quasi-geostrophic flow and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data as test cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and numerical analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such unphysical behavior. We develop long-term physically-consistent data-driven models for the climate system and demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of time-integration with accurate mean and variability.</description>

      <title>TriMe++: Multi-threaded triangular meshing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating large-scale meshes containing between $10^4$ to $10^7$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>

      <title>Inexact Gauss-Newton methods with matrix approximation by sampling for nonlinear least-squares and systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic inexact Gauss-Newton methods for nonlinear least-squares problems and for nonlinear systems ofequations. Random models are formed using suitable sampling strategies for the matrices involved in the deterministic models. The analysis of the expected number of iterations needed in the worst case to achieve a desired level of accuracy in the first-order optimality condition provides guidelines for applying sampling and enforcing, with \minor{a} fixed probability, a suitable accuracy in the random approximations. Results of the numerical validation of the algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Rounding Implicitly Regularizes Tall-and-Thin Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the popularity of stochastic rounding in the context of machine learning and the training of large-scale deep neural network models, we consider stochastic nearness rounding of real matrices $\mathbf{A}$ with many more rows than columns. We provide novel theoretical evidence, supported by extensive experimental evaluation that, with high probability, the smallest singular value of a stochastically rounded matrix is well bounded away from zero -- regardless of how close $\mathbf{A}$ is to being rank deficient and even if $\mathbf{A}$ is rank-deficient. In other words, stochastic rounding \textit{implicitly regularizes} tall and skinny matrices $\mathbf{A}$ so that the rounded version has full column rank. Our proofs leverage powerful results in random matrix theory, and the idea that stochastic rounding errors do not concentrate in low-dimensional column spaces.</description>

      <title>On Smale's 17th problem over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently solving a system of $n$ non-linear equations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Addressing Smale's 17th problem stated in 1998, we consider a setting whereby the $n$ equations are random homogeneous polynomials of arbitrary degrees. In the complex case and for $n= d-1$, Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously developed methods do not apply. We describe a polynomial time algorithm that finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ if the maximal degree is bounded by $d^2$ and for $n=d-1$ if the maximal degree is larger than $d^2$.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian optimization is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Grassmannian $\operatorname{Gr}(k,n)$ is NP-hard. Our results cover all scenarios: (i) when $k$ and $n$ are both allowed to grow; (ii) when $k$ is arbitrary but fixed; (iii) when $k$ is fixed at its lowest possible value $1$. We then deduce the NP-hardness of unconstrained cubic optimization over the Stiefel manifold $\operatorname{V}(k,n)$ and the orthogonal group $\operatorname{O}(n)$. As an addendum we demonstrate the NP-hardness of unconstrained quadratic optimization over the Cartan manifold, i.e., the positive definite cone $\mathbb{S}^n_{\scriptscriptstyle++}$ regarded as a Riemannian manifold, another popular example in manifold optimization. We will also establish the nonexistence of $\mathrm{FPTAS}$ in all cases.</description>

      <title>High order approximations and simulation schemes for the log-Heston process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present weak approximations schemes of any order for the Heston model that are obtained by using the method developed by Alfonsi and Bally (2021). This method consists in combining approximation schemes calculated on different random grids to increase the order of convergence. We apply this method with either the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme (2008) or a second-order scheme that samples exactly the volatility component, and we show rigorously that we can achieve then any order of convergence. We give numerical illustrations on financial examples that validate the theoretical order of convergence. We also present promising numerical results for the multifactor/rough Heston model and hint at applications to other models, including the Bates model and the double Heston model.</description>
