      <title>MUSE observations of V1425 Aql reveal an arc-shaped nova shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.</description>

      <title>Cepheids in spectroscopic binary systems -- current status and recent discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a summary of the current knowledge about Cepheids in binary systems. We focus on the most recent findings and discoveries, such as the highly increasing number of confirmed and candidate spectroscopic binary Cepheids and the progress in determining their physical parameters. This includes new and newly analyzed binary Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We will provide an update on the project to increase the number of the most valuable Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to more than 100. To date, we have confirmed 60 SB2 systems, including detecting a significant orbital motion for 37. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest period reported before and systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past binary interactions, including merger events). Both features are essential to understanding how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and how this influences global Cepheid properties. We will also present nine new systems composed of two Cepheids. Only one such double Cepheid system was known before.</description>

      <title>On the seismic modelling of subgiant stars: testing different grid interpolation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The emergence of mixed modes during the subgiant phase, whose frequencies are characterized by a fast evolution with age, can potentially enable a precise determination of stellar properties, a key goal for future missions like PLATO. However, current modelling techniques often consider grids that lack the resolution to properly account for the fast mode frequency evolution, consequently requiring the use of interpolation algorithms to cover the parameter space in between the grid models when applying model-data comparison methods. Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\ell$=1 mode frequencies within the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors ($\sim$0.1 $\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models. Methods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation algorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and different age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results. The best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines interpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central density $\rho_\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average, an absolute error of 0.14 $\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the interpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical observational errors. Furthermore, we investigated the impact on the accuracy of the interpolation from changes in the physical properties of the stars, showing, in particular, how the addition of core overshoot can affect significantly the interpolation results.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- V. The White Dwarfs Cooling Sequence of M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine infrared (IR) observations collected by the James Webb Space Telescope with optical deep images by the Hubble Space Telescope taken approximately 20 years earlier to compute proper-motion membership for the globular cluster (GC) M 4 (NGC 6121) along its entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). These new IR observations allow us, for only the second time in a GC, to compare WD models with observations over a wide range of wavelengths, constraining fundamental astrophysical properties of WDs. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of WDs with IR excess along the WD CS of M 4, similar to the recent study conducted on the GC NGC 6397. We also determine the age difference between M 4 and NGC 6397 by comparing the absolute F150W2 magnitudes of the luminosity function peak at the bottom of the observed WD CS, and find that M 4 is slightly younger, by 0.8+/-0.5 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Disk in the circumstellar envelope of carbon Mira V Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGB stars are the primary source of dust and complex molecules in the interstellar medium. The determination of outflow parameters is often hindered by the unknown geometry of the circumstellar environment, creating a demand for high-angular resolution observations. We use our NIR spectra and photometry of the carbon AGB star V Cyg, along with literature data, to construct its SED over a wide range of wavelengths. The dust envelope responsible for the IR excess was also resolved in scattered polarized light at angular scales of 50-80 mas using differential speckle polarimetry. We present an interpretation of the thermal and scattered radiation of the dust using models of a spherical dusty outflow (Mdust = 5.3e-7 M_sun) and an inclined equatorial density enhancement, either in the form of a disk (Mdust = 7.6e-3 M_earth) or a torus (Mdust = 5.7e-3 M_earth), which material is concentrated at stellocentric distances less than 25 AU. The dust material consists of amorphous carbon and SiC, with 84% of the dust being amorphous carbon. Dust particle radii range from 5 to 950 nm and follow a power law with an exponent of -3.5. Modeling of the envelope allowed us to improve the accuracy of stellar luminosity estimations: 21000 L_sun and 8300 L_sun at maximum and minimum brightness, respectively. The relation between the disk and the high water content in the envelope is also discussed.</description>

      <title>High flow speeds and transition-region like temperatures in the solar chromosphere during flux emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Flux emergence in the solar atmosphere is a complex process that causes a release of magnetic energy as heat and acceleration of solar plasma at a variety of spatial scales. Methods: We analysed imaging spectropolarimetric data taken in the He 1083 nm line. This line is sensitive to temperatures larger than 15 kK, unlike diagnostics such as \MgIIhk, \CaIIHK, and \Halpha, which lose sensitivity already at 15 kK. The He I data is complemented by imaging spectropolarimetry in the \CaIIK, \Feline, and \Caline\ lines. We employed inversions to determine the magnetic field and vertical velocity in the solar atmosphere. We computed He 1083 nm profiles from a radiation-MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere to help interpretation of the observations. Results: We find fast-evolving blob-like emission features in the He 1083 nm triplet at locations where the magnetic field is rapidly changing direction, and these are likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We fit the line with a model consisting of an emitting layer located below a cold layer representing the fibril canopy. The modelling provides evidence that this model, while simple, catches the essential characteristics of the line formation. The morphology of the emission in the He 1083 nm line is localized and blob-like, unlike the emission in the \CaIIK\ line, which is more filamentary. Conclusions: The modelling shows that the \Heline\ emission features and their Doppler shifts can be caused by opposite-polarity reconnection and/or horizontal current sheets below the canopy layer in the chromosphere. Based on the high observed Doppler width and the blob-like appearance of the emission features, we conjecture that at least a fraction of them are produced by plasmoids. We conclude that transition-region-like temperatures in the deeper layers of the active region chromosphere are more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>11 New Transiting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 11 new transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs from NASA's TESS mission: TOI-2844, TOI-3122, TOI-3577, TOI-3755, TOI-4462, TOI-4635, TOI-4737, TOI-4759, TOI-5240, TOI-5467, and TOI-5882. They consist of 5 brown dwarf companions and 6 very low mass stellar companions ranging in mass from $25 M_{\rm J}$ to $128 M_{\rm J}$. We used a combination of photometric time-series, spectroscopic, and high resolution imaging follow-up as a part of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) in order to characterize each system. With over 50 transiting brown dwarfs confirmed, we now have a large enough sample to directly test different formation and evolutionary scenarios. We provide a renewed perspective on the transiting brown dwarf desert and its role in differentiating between planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Our analysis of the eccentricity distribution for the transiting brown dwarf sample does not support previous claims of a transition between planetary and stellar formation at $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$. We also contribute a first look into the metallicity distribution of transiting companions in the range $7 - 150$ $M_{\rm J}$, showing that this too does not support a $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$ transition. Finally, we also detect a significant lithium absorption feature in one of the brown dwarf hosts (TOI-5882) but determine that the host star is likely old based on rotation, kinematic, and photometric measurements. We therefore claim that TOI-5882 may be a candidate for planetary engulfment.</description>

Abstract: Solar neutrinos, generated abundantly by thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior, offer a unique tool for studying astrophysics and particle physics. The observation of solar neutrinos has led to the discovery of neutrino oscillation, a topic currently under active research, and it has been recognized by two Nobel Prizes. In this pedagogical introduction to solar neutrino physics, we will guide readers through several key questions: How are solar neutrinos produced? How are they detected? What is the solar neutrino problem, and how is it resolved by neutrino oscillation? This article also presents a brief overview of the theory of solar neutrino oscillation, the experimental achievements, new physics relevant to solar neutrinos, and the prospects in this field.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Jet-Bubble-Disk Interaction: Jet Feedback on a Protoplanetary Disk via an Expanding Bubble in WSB 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$~erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Self-Excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-Period Variables: the Transition from Small-Amplitude Red Giants to Semi-Regular Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with OGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.</description>

      <title>Newborn Be star systems observed shortly after mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many classical Be stars acquire their very rapid rotation by mass and angular-momentum transfer in massive binaries. Short-lived intermediate-phase objects have only been discovered recently. Data archives and the literature have been searched for additional candidates exhibiting this patterns. Thirteen candidates were identified at various confidence levels. Adding to the two known systems identified as classical Be star+pre-subdwarf binaries (LB-1 and HR6819), two more (V742Cas, HD44637) could be confirmed with interferometry, with V742Cas setting a new record for the smallest visually observed angular semi-major axis, at a=0.663mas. Two further ones (V447Sct, V1362Cyg) are not resolved interferometrically, but other evidence puts them at the same confidence level as LB-1. V2174Cyg is a candidate with very high confidence, but was not observed interferometrically. The remaining ones are either candidates with varying levels of confidence. Of a mostly magnitude complete sample of 328 Be stars, 0.5-1% are found to have recently completed the mass overflow that led to their formation. Another 5% are systems with compact subdwarf companions, i.e., further evolved after a previous overflow, and possibly two more percent harbor white dwarfs. All these systems are of early B-subtypes, however, and if the original sample is restricted to early subtypes (136 objects), these percentages increase by a factor of about 2.5, while dropping to zero for the mid and late subtypes (together 204 objects). This strongly suggests that early- vs. mid- and late-type Be stars have differently weighted channels to acquire their rapid rotation, namely binary interaction vs. evolutionary spin-up.</description>

      <title>New insights into the proton precipitation sites in solar flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectrocopy Imager (RHESSI) $\gamma$-ray observations of the extraordinary GOES X25 flare SOL2003-10-28T11:10 are revisited to investigate previously reported conclusions that flare-accelerated electrons and protons precipitate along spatially separated flare loops. In contrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended time periods ($\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile in combination with observations of the prompt $\gamma$-ray lines from the INTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing the peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting $\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to identify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation occurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in the two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003 is different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223 MeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons precipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter integration times reveals that the $\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially coincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and proton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the electron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's imaging capabilities. This result solves the twenty-years-long mystery around the previously reported different electron and proton precipitation sites.</description>

Abstract: Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf stars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of utilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two distinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the $M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number of stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\sim9.4$, coinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy transportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood stellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the effective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at $\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass, contributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two populations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and young stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with bright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in O-type stars and Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent small-scale structures in the envelopes and winds of massive stars have long been suggested as the cause for excessive line broadening that could not be explained by other mechanisms such as thermal broadening. However, the origin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been extensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified stellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Particularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is consistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin of this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick envelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could drive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear simulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and tracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the analytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to two possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic instability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different instabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the growth rate $\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct $\omega \sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra analysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather increases with $k$ - tentatively as $\omega \sim \sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest that structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop from the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible with either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains inconclusive for now.</description>

      <title>Turning point principle for stability of viscous gaseous stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stability of non-rotating viscous gaseous stars modeled by the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system. Under general assumptions on the equations of states, we proved that the number of unstable modes for the linearized Navier-Stokes-Poisson system equals that of the linearized Euler-Poisson system modeling inviscid gaseous stars. In particular, the turning point principle holds true for non-rotating stars with or without viscosity. That is, the transition of stability only occurs at the extrema of the total mass and the number of unstable modes is determined by the mass-radius curve. For the proof, we establish an infinite dimensional Kelvin-Tait-Chetaev theorem for a class of linear second order PDEs with dissipation. Moreover, we prove that linear stability implies nonlinear asymptotic stability and linear instability implies nonlinear instability for Navier-Stokes-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Mass and wind luminosity of young Galactic open clusters in Gaia DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Star clusters constitute a significant part of the stellar population in our Galaxy. The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium impact multiple physical processes from the chemical to the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might act as efficient particle accelerators and contribute to the production of cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the young (&lt; 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space mission. This is crucial for determining the energy channeled into accelerated particles. Methods. To do this, we developed a method relying on the number, magnitude, and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster. Assuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution and accounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by the age and mass of the parent cluster, we conservatively estimated the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local clusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compared the results of our computation with recent estimates of young cluster masses. With respect to these, our sample is three times more abundant, particularly above a few thousand solar masses. This is of the utmost relevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction of accelerated particles. The cluster wind luminosity distribution we obtained extends up to 3x10^38 erg/s. This is a promising feature in terms of potential particle acceleration scenarios.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disc after tidal disruption is $\sim0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. In this scenario, WD 1856+534 b might have formed at or close to its present separation, in contrast to other proposed scenarios where it would have migrated in from a much larger separation. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WDs.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. The previous letter in this series describes our project and associated TRON pipeline designed to mine archival MeerKAT data for transient and variable sources. In this letter, we report on a new transient, a radio flare, associated with Gaia DR3 6865945581361480448, a G type star, whose parallax places it at a distance of 1334 pc. Its duration and high degree of circular polarization suggests electron cyclotron maser instability as the mechanism, consistent with an RS CVn variable.</description>
