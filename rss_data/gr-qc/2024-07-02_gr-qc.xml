      <title>Gravitational wave memory and its effects on particles and fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave memory is said to arise when a gravitational wave burst produces changes in a physical system that persist even after the wave has passed. This paper analyzes gravitational wave bursts in plane wave spacetimes, deriving memory effects on timelike and null geodesics, massless scalar fields, and massless spinning particles whose motion is described by the spin Hall equations. All associated memory effects are found to be characterized by four ``memory tensors,'' three of which are independent. These tensors form a scattering matrix for the transverse components of geodesics. However, unlike for the ``classical'' memory effect involving initially comoving pairs of timelike geodesics, one of our results is that memory effects for null geodesics can have strong longitudinal components. When considering massless particles with spin, we solve the spin Hall equations analytically by showing that there exists a conservation law associated with each conformal Killing vector field. These solutions depend only on the same four memory tensors that control geodesic scattering. For massless scalar fields, we show that given any solution in flat spacetime, a weak-field solution in a plane wave spacetime can be generated just by differentiation. Precisely which derivatives are involved depend on the same four memory tensors, and the derivative operators they determine can be viewed as ``continuum'' memory effects.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a quantum-corrected black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals are crucial sources for future space-based gravitational wave detections. Gravitational waveforms emitted by extreme mass-ratio inspirals are closely related to the orbital dynamics of small celestial objects, which vary with the underlying spacetime geometry. Despite the tremendous success of general relativity, there are unsolved issues such as singularities in both black holes and cosmology. Loop quantum gravity, a theory addressing these singularity problems, offers a framework for regular black holes. In this paper, we focus on periodic orbits of a small celestial object around a supermassive quantum-corrected black hole in loop quantum gravity and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms. We view the small celestial object as a massive test particle and obtain its four-velocity and effective potential. Our results indicate that the quantum parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ influences the shape of the effective potential. We explore the effects of quantum corrections on marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and other periodic orbits. Using the numerical kludge scheme, we further explore the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different periodic orbits. The waveforms exhibit distinct zoom and whirl phases in a complete orbital period, closely tied to the quantum parameter $\hat{\alpha}$. We also perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waves from these periodic orbits and assess their detectability. With the steady progress of space-based gravitational wave detection programs, our findings will contribute to utilizing extreme mass-ratio inspirals to test and understand the properties of quantum-corrected black holes.</description>

      <title>Optical Polarization Holonomy in the Kerr Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization holonomy is analytically determined for a class of closed, spherical trajectories of light transiting a black hole in the Kerr metric. The leading order geometric optics approximation admits a closed-form expression of such paths, and sets of source/receiver locations are quantified for a spectrum of black hole angular momenta. A conserved, conformal Yano-Killing scalar is then exploited to determine the evolving polarization. Polarization holonomy, the angle between outgoing and incoming polarizations, is quantified for the spectrum of admissible direct and retrograde trajectories.</description>

      <title>Even- and odd-parity stabilities of black holes in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether theories with a timelike unit vector field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric black holes against both even- and odd-parity perturbations. For this purpose, we formulate a gauge-invariant black hole perturbation theory in the background Aether-orthogonal frame where the spacelike property of hypersurfaces orthogonal to the timelike Aether field is always maintained even inside the metric horizon. Using a short-wavelength approximation with large radial and angular momenta, we show that, in general, there are three dynamical degrees of freedom arising from the even-parity sector besides two propagating degrees of freedom present in the odd-parity sector. The propagation speeds of even-parity perturbations and their no-ghost conditions coincide with those of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on the Minkowski background, while the odd sector contains tensor and vector modes with the same propagation speeds as those in the even-parity sector (and hence as those on the Minkowski background). Thus, the consistent study of black hole perturbations in the Aether-orthogonal frame on static and spherically symmetric backgrounds does not add new small-scale stability conditions to those known for the Minkowski background in the literature.</description>

      <title>Accretion of the degenerate Fermi gas onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of a degenerate relativistic Fermi gas onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. The accretion theory is based on the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and the Fermi gas follows Fermi-Dirac statistics at infinity. We have derived the expression for the particle current density, the stress energy-momentum tensor, and three accretion rates. As the charged particle falls into the black hole, both the mass and the charge of the black hole increase. Consequently, the mass accretion rate and charge accretion rate are proportional to the particle accretion rate. We have also provided analytical results at infinity and numerical results within a finite range for these quantities. Our results indicate that the accretion rate decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. Additionally, we found that the Vlasov gas accretion is no longer an isotropic perfect fluid accretion theory in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates at infinity, mainly due to non-vanishing non-diagonal terms of the stress energy-momentum tensor. Despite this, the radial pressure remains smaller than the tangential pressure even at infinity. This study also suggests that naked singularities are unavoidable in black hole accretion theory.</description>

      <title>Comparison of 4.5PN and 2SF gravitational energy fluxes from quasicircular compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past three years have seen two significant advances in models of gravitational waveforms emitted by quasicircular compact binaries in two regimes: the weak-field, post-Newtonian regime, in which the gravitational wave energy flux has now been calculated to fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order (4.5PN) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 121402 (2023)]; and the small-mass-ratio, gravitational self-force regime, in which the flux has now been calculated to second perturbative order in the mass ratio (2SF) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102 (2021)]. We compare these results and find excellent agreement for the total flux, showing consistency between the two calculations at all available PN and SF orders. However, although the total fluxes agree, we find disagreements in the fluxes due to individual spherical-harmonic modes of the waveform, strongly suggesting the two waveforms might be in different asymptotic frames.</description>

      <title>The ringdown-quantum gravity connection in real and analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to quantum gravity, a black hole horizon should feature quantum fluctuations. We explore the possibility that these fluctuations radiate Hawking radiation dynamically. By studying the observed ringdowns after black hole mergers, we find that the amplitude of the horizon fluctuations should be on the order of the Planck length, in order to emit the quantity of gravitons corresponding to Hawking radiation. If the horizon fluctuations themselves are quasinormal modes, then the Hawking graviton spectrum is much more accurate than the usual blackbody spectrum. Furthermore, it would only take one quasinormal mode, with its broad, damped spectrum, to emit the entire Hawking spectrum of gravitons. We check the dynamical Hawking radiation hypothesis by means of a sonic black hole; we induce additional fluctuations in the horizon, and observe enhanced Hawking radiation. As expected, we see that the spontaneous Hawking radiation is entangled, while the enhanced Hawking radiation is not, since we induce it deterministically.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Multi-Band Observations of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we highlight an important perspective for the complete understanding of the stochastic gravitational background structure. The stochastic gravitational wave background is perhaps the most important current and future tool towards pinpointing the early Universe phenomenology related with the inflationary era and the subsequent reheating era. Many mysteries are inherent to the stochastic spectrum so in this work we highlight the fact that the complete understanding of early Universe physics and of astrophysical processes requires data from many distinct frequency band ranges. The combination of these data will provide a deeper and better understanding of the physics that forms the stochastic gravitational wave background, in both cases that it is of cosmological or astrophysical origin. We also discuss how the reheating temperature may be determined by combining multi-band frequency data from gravitational wave experiments and we also discuss how the shape of the gravitational wave energy spectrum can help us better understand the physical processes that formed it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a massive scalar field non-minimally coupled with gravity is considered. Assuming a regular and spherically symmetric background, specifically a regular black hole solution, the energy-momentum tensor is calculated. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism and its topological structure, the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect are investigated. The results for the regular black hole are compared with those obtained for the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>A proposal of quasi-local mass for 2-surfaces of timelike mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-local mass, typically defined as an integral over a spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$, should encode information about the gravitational field within a finite, extended region bounded by $\Sigma$. Therefore, in attempts to quantize gravity, one may consider an infinite dimensional space of $2$-surfaces instead of an infinite dimensional space of $4$-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. However, existing definitions for quasilocal mass only applies to surfaces outside an horizon whose mean curvature vector is spacelike. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy/mass to surfaces with timelike mean curvature vector, including in particular trapped surfaces. We adopt the same canonical gauge as in the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy but allow the pulled back "killing vector" to the physical spacetime to be spacelike. We define the new quasi-local energy along the Hamiltonian formulation of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. The new definition yields a positive definite surface energy density and a new divergence free current. Calculations for coordinate spheres in Kerr family spacetime are shown. In the spherical symmetric case, our definition reduces to a previous definition \cite{lundgren2007self}.</description>

      <title>Duality Operator in Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity is a theory of gravity which replaces the Levi-Civita connection by a teleparallel connection - a metric-compatible connection with vanishing curvature. Teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) is a special case from this class of theories, and its dynamics is governed by equations which are equivalent to Einstein field equations of general relativity. In 2009 Lucas and Pereira presented the idea of a new operator that would allow us to express the action of TEGR in a form reminiscent of the Yang-Mills action for a gauge theory, for which torsion is the field strength. The authors constructed the operator as a duality operator acting on torsion 2-forms and curvature 2-forms, taking into account all the contractions of these forms with the volume form of the spacetime manifold. The definition of this operator for other forms, however, remained unclear. In this thesis, we seek to give a mathematically consistent definition of the operator, and we follow the results published by Lucas and Pereira. We show that the approach taken by Lucas and Pereira does not lead to a consistent definition of this operator, because it results in the operator with the desired properties either being non-unique or non-existent.</description>

      <title>On restrictions of current warp drive spacetimes and immediate possibilities of improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looking at current proposals of so-called `warp drive spacetimes', they appear to employ General Relativity only at an elementary level. A number of strong restrictions are imposed such as flow-orthogonality of the spacetime foliation, vanishing spatial Ricci tensor, dimensionally reduced and coordinate-dependent velocity fields, to mention the main restrictions. We here provide a brief summary of our proposal of a general and covariant description of spatial motions within General Relativity, then discuss the restrictions that are employed in the majority of the current literature. That current warp drive models are discussed to be unphysical may not be surprising; they lack important ingredients such as covariantly non-vanishing spatial velocity, acceleration, vorticity, together with curved space, and a warp mechanism.</description>

      <title>The evolution and detection of vector superradiant instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight vectors can extract energy and angular momentum from a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability, resulting in the formation of a BH-condensate system. In this work, we carefully investigate the evolution of this system numerically with multiple superradiant modes. Simple formulas are obtained to estimate important timescales, maximum masses of different modes, as well as the BH mass and spin at various times. Due to the coexistence of modes with small frequency differences, the BH-condensate system emits gravitational waves with a unique beat signature, which could be directly observed by current and projected interferometers. Besides, the current BH spin-mass data from the binary BH merger events already excludes the vector mass in the range $5\times 10^{-15}\ \mathrm{eV} &lt;\mu&lt; 9\times 10^{-12}\ \mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR) and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model do not contradict to observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: We study even-parity black hole perturbations in Minimal Theory of Bigravity (MTBG). We consider the Schwarzschild solution written in the spatially-flat coordinates in the self-accelerating branch as the background solution. We clarify the gauge transformations for the $\ell=0$, $1$, and $\geq2$ modes with $\ell$ being the angular multipole moments under the joint foliation-preserving diffeomorphism transformation. Requiring that the asymptotic regions in the physical and fiducial sectors share the same Minkowski vacua, the solution to the $\ell=0$ perturbations can be absorbed by a redefinition of the Schwarzschild background. In order to analyze the $\ell=1$ and $\geq 2$ modes, for simplicity we focus on the effectively massless case, where the constant parameter measuring the ratio of the proper times between the two sectors is set to unity and the effective mass terms in the equations of motion vanish. We also find that as a particular solution all the $\ell=1$ perturbations vanish by imposing their regularity at spatial infinity. For each of the $\ell\geq 2$ modes, in the effectively massless case, we highlight the existence of the expected two propagating modes and four instantaneous modes.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman outside a rotating de Sitter-type core: A rotating version of the Lemos-Zanchin electrically charged solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rotating version of the electrically charged solution of the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations modeling static regular black holes by Lemos and Zanchin [Phys. Rev. D 83, 124005 (2011)] is obtained in the present work. The full rotating geometry consists of the Kerr-Newman exterior geometry outside a rotating de Sitter-type core with an electrically charged spheroidal shell at the boundary. To achieve this interior geometry, we utilize the G\"urses-G\"ursey metric and employ the Newman-Janis algorithm to generate the rotating version of the static solution. The metrics of the two spacetime regions are smoothly matched together at the rotating electrically charged shell, while the electromagnetic field satisfies the usual boundary conditions at a charged surface. Interestingly, we note that, although the Newman-Janis procedure preserves the overall electric charge of the static solution, the arbitrariness of the algorithm allows us to propose different electromagnetic fields and charge (current) distributions for the same geometry of the interior region, together with different charge (current) densities on the rotating boundary shell. For a particular choice of the interior electromagnetic field, we show that it is possible to interpret the rotating de Sitter fluid as being electrically polarized due to its rotation, despite the absence of net electric charge within the interior region, which is instead concentrated solely on the charged shell. The properties of the entire rotating solution, such as curvature regularity, energy-momentum tensor and energy conditions, are thoroughly examined in the text, revealing various types of charged rotating objects.</description>

      <title>Generalized Siklos space-times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by supersymmetry methods in general relativity, we study four-dimensional Lorentzian space-times with a complex Dirac spinor field satisfying a Killing-spinor-like equation where the Killing constant is promoted to a complex function. We call the resulting geometry a generalized Siklos space-time. After deriving a number of identities for complex spaces, we specialize to Lorentz signature, where we show that the Killing function must be real and that the corresponding Dirac spinor is Majorana (as long as the space-time is not conformally flat), and we obtain the local form of the metric. We show that the purely gravitational degrees of freedom correspond to waves, whereas the matter sources generically correspond, via Einstein's field equations, to a sum of pure radiation and a space-like perfect fluid. Consequently, we conclude that the physically relevant case is obtained when the Killing function is homogeneous on the wave surfaces.</description>

      <title>An Event Horizon 'Firewall' Undergoing Cosmological Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed an object with a singular horizon structure, reminiscent of (but fundamentally different from, except in a limiting case) a black-hole event horizon, in an expanding, spherically symmetric, homogeneous, Universe that has a positive cosmological constant. Conformal representation is discussed. There is a temperature/pressure singularity and a corresponding scalar curvature singularity at the horizon. The expanding singular horizon ultimately bounds the entire space-time manifold. It is is preceded by an expanding light front, which separates the space-time affected by the singularity from that which is not yet affected. An appropriately located observer in front of the light front can have a Hubble-Lema\^itre constant that is consistent with that currently observed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chern-Pontryagin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>

      <title>Estimating the possible QPOs of M87* from the parameters of a hairy Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the shock cone formed around the hairy Kerr black hole due to BHL accretion and investigate the QPO behaviors resulting from the black hole-cone interaction, aiming to predict the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole. To achieve this, we use the hairy Kerr black hole parameters consistent with the observed shadow parameters of M87* as initial conditions in numerical simulations, revealing the structure of the resulting shock cone and QPOs in a strong gravitational field. Numerical calculations show that the deviation of the hairy Kerr black hole from the Kerr metric and the hair parameters significantly influence the complex behavior of the resulting QPOs. It is found that the Lense-Thirring effect and the pressure modes trapped within the cone lead to the excitation of QPOs. The hair parameter has been observed to suppress the resulting QPO frequencies. The Lense-Thirring effect, in a strong gravitational field with a black hole spin parameter of a/M &gt; 0.7, also suppresses other modes and generates high-frequency QPOs. It is predicted that the QPO frequencies observed around the M87* black hole could span a wide range from nHz to mHz. Using both Kerr and hairy Kerr gravities, the QPO frequencies formed around the M87* black hole can be explained. Especially in cases where the black hole is spinning rapidly, PSD analyses have shown very distinct low-frequency QPOs and resonance conditions in both gravities. By comparing the results obtained from numerical calculations with observational and analytical results, we discuss the observability of the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of fluctuations at the early stage of the universe provides enough confidence to rely on the averaging methods. However, the nonlinearity of general relativity makes it extremely difficult. There are different methods to study inhomogeneous cosmology and provide a straightforward solution to the averaging problem in cosmology, such as Buchert's spatial averaging. I am attempting to study early cosmic inflation using Buchert equations and the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. Buchert equations and Mori-Zwanzig formalism's coarse-grained description are the geometrical source of early cosmic inflation through higher-order differential equations. It can be seen that the observational data and the given theoretical results are in agreement.</description>

      <title>Universal Basic Mass Density inside Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a universal basic mass density and a universal basic metric inside dark matter halos in the framework of Einstein equations providing an analytical ground for learning about dark matter. In a previous work the authors have proposed a simplified model for galaxies: a Schwarzschild black hole (that contains all the baryonic matter of the galaxy) immersed inside a dark matter halo. The solution solved the Einstein equations perturbatively and successfully gave the flat rotation curve and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, the two signatures of spiral galaxies. In this work we take the black hole mass (the baryonic mass) of the solution to be zero in order to focus our study on the dark matter halo exclusively. Among the results (1) is the prediction of a universal basic mass density of dark matter, $\rho=a_0/2\pi G r$, where $a_0\approx 2.8 \times 10^{-11} \ m/s^2$ is a universal constant whose value was deduced from observations, (2) we show that the mass and velocity curve of the dark halo agree excellently with observational data at intermediate distances where the baryonic matter contribution is negligible, (3) we show that the constant $a_0$ is the origin of the constant surface density of dark matter and the origin of the scale-radius/scale-density scaling relation of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile (4) we show how the inclusion of baryonic matter in our model solves the core-cusp problem.</description>

Abstract: We construct the first binary black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The attractive force between the two black holes is balanced by the addition of a background electric field, sourced at the conformal boundary. There is a continuous family of bulk solutions for a given boundary profile and temperature, suggesting there is continuous non-uniqueness. We investigate the charges of the solutions and verify numerically that they satisfy a first law of black hole mechanics relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a bipartite quantum system in an energy eigenstate, the dynamical description for one component can be derived via entanglement using the other component as a clock. This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism. Moreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative time evolution is then described by a Time-Dilated Schr\"odinger equation, in which the so-called Redshift Operator describes a purely quantum effect, analogue to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a non-perturbative approach and present a finite-dimensional generalisation of this mechanism, expressing the quantum time-dilation effect as an effective interaction involving previously non-interacting system components. We name this a Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an example using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is suitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new tool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Neutron star mountains supported by crustal lattice pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or "mountain", sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have left an imprint in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) throughout their evolution in the history of the Universe. This review highlights two types of SGWB: those generated by scalar curvature perturbations associated with PBH formation in the early Universe and those composed of ensembles of GWs emitted by PBH binaries. After describing detection methods and a brief introduction on Bayesian inference, we discuss current constraints imposed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations through the non-detection of the SGWBs and discuss their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor/scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Nonlinear Electrodynamics in the Universe: A Dynamical Systems Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of cosmological models incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), focusing on their stability and causality. We explore two specific NLED models: the Power-Law and Rational Lagrangians. We assess these models' viability in describing the universe's evolution using dynamical systems theory and Bayesian inference. We present the theoretical framework of NLED coupled with general relativity, followed by an analysis of the stability and causality through the squared sound speed of the NLED Lagrangians. We then conduct a detailed dynamical analysis to identify the universe's evolution with this matter content. Our results show that the Power-Law Lagrangian model transitions through various cosmological phases from a Maxwell radiation-dominated state to a matter-dominated state. For the Rational Lagrangian model, including the Maxwell term, stable and causal behavior is observed within specific parameter ranges, with critical points indicating the evolutionary pathways of the universe. To validate our theoretical findings, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using a comprehensive set of observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). The estimated parameters for both models align with expected values for the current universe, particularly the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the Hubble parameter $h$. However, the parameters $\alpha$ and $b$ are not tightly constrained within the prior ranges. Our model comparison strongly favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the NLED models for late-universe observations, as the NLED model does not exhibit a cosmological constant behavior. Our results highlight the need for further refinement and exploration of NLED-based cosmological models to fully integrate them into the standard cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Soft synchronous gauge: principal value prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synchronous gauge in gravity ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) is ill-defined due to the singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. Previously we studied "softening" this gauge by considering instead the gauge $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu} = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $ in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We now explore the possibility of using a principal value prescription (not in the standard Cauchy sense), which amounts, roughly speaking, to replacing singularities $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$, which then behave like distributions. We show that such a propagator follows upon adding to the action a gauge-violating term of a general form, which reduces to $ \sim \int f_\lambda \Lambda^{\lambda \mu} f_\mu \d^4 x $ with a constant operator $\Lambda^{\lambda \mu}$ depending on $\partial$ and a metric functional $f_\lambda$. The contribution of Faddeev-Popov's ghosts to the effective action is analysed. For the required intermediate regularization, the discrete structure of the theory at small distances is implied. It is shown that the ghost contribution can be disregarded in the limit $ \varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypergeometric stringy corrections in the swampland program for rescaled gravity. Precisely, we study inflationary models from Gauss-Bonnet hypergeometric scalar couplings via the falsification scenario. We first derive generalized exponential potentials from such hypergeometric behaviors. Then, we examine certain selected scalar potentials by computing the relevant cosmological quantities using the slow-roll mechanism. Choosing specific points in the corresponding moduli space, we provide viable findings corroborated by Planck observational data and checked by the swampland criteria.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and a sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss bounds to strong gravity arising from annihilation of electron and positrons and the corresponding enhancement of the cross section for the production of massive particles. Two complementary examples are discussed, the case of the $e^+e^- \to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short lifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron positron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the next generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds arising from direct graviton searches.</description>

Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an attempt of string theoretic derivation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy. Despite not admitting a de Sitter vacuum, the string theory, by the power of open-close correspondence, captures the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as the entropy of Chan-Paton species on a de Sitter-like state obtained via $D$-branes. Moreover, this derivation sheds a new light at the origin of the area-form, since the equality takes place for a critical 't Hooft coupling for which the species entropy of open strings saturates the area-law unitarity bound.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic language for the Causaloid framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Causaloid framework is an operational approach aimed to house both the radical aspects of General Relativity -- dynamic causal structure, and Quantum Theory -- indefiniteness, to provide a scaffolding that might be suitable for Quantum Gravity by providing a landscape of theories that allow for indefinite causal structure. One may consider it as a generalisation of generalised probability theories (or GPTs) where a priori regions are not assumed to have any given causal relationship, to incorporate the possibility of indefinite causal structure. Since its conception, there have been many advances in the field of indefinite causal structure mostly stemming from the work of Chiribella et al. on the quantum switch and supermaps and from Oreshkov et al. on causal inequalities and process matrices. These approaches have systems moving along wires and use Hilbert space structure. They violate the standard causality constraints of Quantum Theory and, in this sense, can be regarded as post-quantum. The Causaloid approach does not necessarily have systems moving along wires or Hilbert spaces. This is the first paper in a trilogy of papers aiming to close the gap between the Causaloid (that allows for GPTs) and post-quantum studies that employ Hilbert spaces. To do so in the present paper, we provide a diagrammatic language for the Causaloid framework along with new terminology for the three levels of physical compression (called Tomographic, Compositional, and Meta compression).</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes as Relativistic Systems with Kepler Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves emanating from inspiralling black hole binaries has triggered a renewed interest in the dynamics of relativistic two-body systems. The conservative part of the latter are given by Hamiltonian systems obtained from so called post-Newtonian expansions of the general relativistic description of black hole binaries. In this paper we study the general question of whether there exist relativistic binaries that display Kepler-like dynamics with elliptical orbits. We show that an orbital equivalence to the Kepler problem indeed exists for relativistic systems with a Hamiltonian of a Kepler-like form. This form is realised by extremal black holes with electric charge and scalar hair to at least first order in the post-Newtonian expansion for arbitrary mass ratios and to all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion in the test-mass limit of the binary. Moreover, to fifth post-Newtonian order, we show that Hamiltonians of the Kepler-like form can be related explicitly through a canonical transformation and time reparametrization to the Kepler problem, and that all Hamiltonians conserving a Laplace-Runge-Lenz-like vector are related in this way to Kepler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study analyses the wormhole solution both in the dRGT-$ f(R,T) $ massive gravity and Einstein massive gravity. In both the models, the anisotropic pressure solution in ultrastatic wormhole geometry gives rise to the shape function that involves massive gravity parameters $ \gamma $ and $ \Lambda $. However, the terms consisting of $ \gamma $ and $ \Lambda $ acts in such a way that the spacetime loses asymptotic flatness. Similar to the black hole solution in massive gravity, this inconsistency arises due to the repulsive effect of gravity which can be represented by the photon deflection angle that goes negative after a certain radial distance. It is investigated that the repulsive effect induced in the massive gravitons push the spacetime geometry so strongly that the asymptotic flatness is effected. On the other hand, in this model, one can have a wormhole with ordinary matter at the throat that satisfies all the energy conditions while the negative energy density is sourced by massive gravitons. Finally, using the TOV equation, it is found that the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of perfect fluid dark matter and quantum corrections on the thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic-charged black hole. We consider the metric of the static non-linear magnetic-charged black hole in the background of perfect fluid dark matter. Starting with the black hole temperature and the corrected entropy, we use the event horizon propriety in order to find the temperature, and based on the surface gravity definition, we find the uncorrected entropy. However, using the definition of the corrected entropy due to thermal fluctuation, we find and plot the entropy of the black hole. We find that the entropy is highly affected for smaller non-linear magnetic-charged black holes. Afterwards, we study the thermodynamic stability of the black hole by computing and plotting the evolution of heat capacity. The results show that second-order phase transition occurs, which appears more later as the dark matter parameter decreases, and leads the black hole to move from the stable phase to the unstable phase. Furthermore, we show that the heat capacity for smaller black holes are also affected, since it appears not being only an increasing function.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with gauge-invariant polarization states of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of the polarization modes of gravitational waves (GWs) and their dispersion relations is a crucial task for scrutinizing the viability of extended theories of gravity. A tool to investigate the polarization states of GWs is the well-known formalism developed by Eardley, Lee, and Lightman (ELL) [Phys. Rev. D 8, 3308 (1973)] which uses the Newman-Penrose (NP) coefficients to determine the polarization content of GWs in metric theories of gravity. However, if the speed of GWs is smaller than the speed of light, the number of NP coefficients is greater than the number of polarizations. To overcome this inconvenience we use the Bardeen formalism to describe the six possible polarization modes of GWs considering general dispersion relations for the modes. The definition of a new gauge-invariant quantity enables an unambiguous description of the scalar longitudinal polarization mode. We apply the formalism to General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories, $f(R)$-gravity, and a wide class of quadratic gravity. We derive an explicit relation between a physical observable (the derivative of the frequency shift of an electromagnetic signal), and the gauge-invariant variables. Then we find an analytical formula for the pulsar timing rms response to each polarization mode. To estimate the sensitivity of a single pulsar timing we focus on the case of a dispersion relation of a massive particle. The sensitivity curves of the scalar longitudinal and vector polarization modes change significantly depending on the value of the effective mass. The detection (or absence of detection) of the polarization modes using the pulsar timing technique has decisive implications for alternative theories of gravity. Finally, investigating a cutoff frequency in the pulsar timing band can lead to a more stringent bound on the graviton mass than that presented by ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric dynamics of the primordial electric and magnetic fields during the early stages of the universe by extending a recently introduced quantum algebra \cite{BMM,BMAS}. We work on an extended model of gravity that considers the boundary terms from the Einstein-Hilbert action as geometric quantum fluctuations of the spacetime. We propose that the extended Riemann manifold is generated by a new connection ${\hat{\delta\Gamma}}^{\mu}_{\alpha\beta}$. This connection contains geometric information about the fluctuations of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the vacuum, which could have been crucial during the primordial stages of the universe's evolution. We revisit a preinflationary cosmological model \cite{mb} with a variable time scale and negative spatial curvature, such that the universe begins with a null initial background energy density. We observed the emergence of large scale magnetic fields starting from small values during the early phases of the universe's evolution. Subsequently, these fields decrease to reach present day values on the order of $\left&lt;\hat{\delta B}\right&gt; \simeq 10^{-12}\,{\rm G}$ on cosmological scales (between $10^{24}$ and $10^{26}$ meters). This significant deviation from inflationary models eliminates the need to impose excessively large initial values on these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to study linear perturbations of bimetric gravity on any spherically symmetric background, including dynamical spacetimes. The setup is based on the Gerlach-Sengupta formalism for general relativity. Each of the two background metrics is written as a warped product between a two-dimensional Lorentzian metric and the round metric of the two-sphere. The different perturbations are then decomposed in terms of tensor spherical harmonics, which makes the two polarity (axial and polar) sectors decouple. In addition, a covariant notation on the Lorentzian manifold is used so that all expressions are valid for any coordinates. In this theory, there are seven physical propagating degrees of freedom, which, as compared to the two degrees of freedom of general relativity, makes the dynamics much more intricate. In particular, we discuss the amount of gauge and physical degrees of freedom for different polarities and multipoles. Finally, as an interesting application, we analyze static nonbidiagonal backgrounds and derive the corresponding perturbative equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stationary, axisymmetric, dust sourced solutions of Einstein's equations have been proposed as fully general relativistic models for disc galaxies. These models introduce a novel physical element, i.e., a non-negligible dragging vortex emerging from a full consideration of the essential self-interaction of matter and geometry in general relativity, which might demand a profound recalibration of the inferred amount of dark matter in disc galaxies. Within this framework, we identify the correct observables for redshift-inferred rotation curves of distant galaxies, correcting previously overlooked mistakes in the literature. We find that the presence of the dragging vortex introduces non-negligible corrective terms for the matter density required to maintain a stable physical system. We present the first estimate of the dragging speed which is required to explain a non-negligible fraction of dark matter in disc galaxies. In particular, we show that a sub-relativistic dragging velocity of tens of kilometers per second in the neighbourhood of the Sun is sufficient to reduce the need of dark matter by 50% in the Milky Way. Finally, we find that the presence of such a dragging vortex also returns a net contribution to the strong gravitational lensing generated by the galaxy. Thus, we show that the considered class of general relativistic galaxy models, is not only physically viable, but suggests the need for recalibration of the estimated dark matter content in disc galaxies, with far reaching consequences for astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this potential in non-canonical framework align with the observational data of Planck 2018. We determine how the predictions of the model vary with changes in the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. The sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all influenced by $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits degeneracy with respect to changes in $\alpha$. It is found that, this degeneracy does not break through reheating consideration. But the length of the reheating epoch constrains the length of the inflation period and the value of $\alpha$. Therefore, we investigate relic gravitational waves (GWs) and show that, the degeneracy of the model with respect to the $\alpha$ parameter can be broken using the relic GWs. Additionally, the density of relic GWs falls within the sensitivity range of GWs detectors for the specific $e$-folds number between 55 and 55.7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take into account redshift-space distortion measurements to investigate the growth of cosmological large-scale structures within the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. After comparing the predictions of the $f(Q)$-gravity expansion history with OHD and SNIa datasets and constraining the pertinent cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $H_0$, together with the exponent $n$ for $f(Q)$ power-law models, we derive the full system of equations governing linear cosmological perturbations to study matter fluctuations using the $1 + 3$ covariant formalism when applied to $f(Q)$ gravity. Thus, we resort to both the usual redshift-space distortion data $f\sigma_8$ and some recent separate measurements of the growth rate $f$ and the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations to find the best-fit cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $n$. We also apply a collective analysis of such growth-structure data together with the aforementioned cosmic expansion measurements, to restrict these parameters through Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations. determining the statistical significance for the best-fit parameter values through the AIC and BIC Bayesian selection criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the full Horndeski theory with both curvature and torsion can support nonsingular, stable and subluminal cosmological solutions at all times. Thus, with torsion, the usual No-Go theorem that holds in a curved spacetime is avoided. In particular, it is essential to include the nonminimal derivative couplings of the $\mathcal{L}_{5}$ part of the Horndeski action ($G^{\mu\nu}\,\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \phi,$ and $(\nabla^2 \phi)^3$). Without the latter a No-Go already impedes the eternal subluminality of nonsingular, stable cosmologies.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute quasinormal mode frequencies for static limits of physical black holes - semi-classical black hole solutions to Einstein-Hilbert gravity characterized by the finite formation time of an apparent horizon and its weak regularity. These assumptions lead to a highly constrained yet non-trivial form of the metric and components of the energy-momentum tensor near the horizon, which contain as a special case many known models of black holes. Using a two-point M-fraction approximation to construct an interpolating metric which captures the essential near-horizon and asymptotic properties of black holes, we explore a large part of the parameter space that characterizes the near-horizon geometry. We cast the perturbation problem as a discretized homogeneous eigensystem and compute the low-lying quasinormal mode frequencies for perturbations of a massless scalar field. Working in spherical symmetry, we provide rough constraints on leading and subleading deviations from the Schwarzschild solution which arise in a semi-classical setting, and demonstrate the potential for mimicking signatures of axially-symmetric geometries from a spherically-symmetric source.</description>

      <title>Cosmology Based on Finsler and Finsler-like Metric Structure of Gravitational Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we review some aspects of gravitational field and cosmology based on Finsler and Finsler-like generalized metric structures. The geometrical framework of these spaces allows further investigation of locally-anisotropic phenomena related to the gravitational field and cosmological considerations, e.g the extracted geodesics, deflection of light, Finsler-Einstein gravitational field equations , the Friedmann equations and the Raychaudhuri equations include extra anisotropic terms that in the Riemannian framework of General Relativity (GR) are not interpreted. This approach gives us the opportunity to extend the research with more degrees of freedom on the tangent bundle of a spacetime manifold. In the above mentioned generalizations omitting the extra anisotropic terms we recover the framework of GR. In addition, we study the gravitational Magnus effect in a generalized metric framework.
  Based on this approach, we describe further properties of Finsler-Randers (FR) and Schwarzschild Finsler Randers (SFR) cosmological models which are useful for the description and evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to equally acceptable Bose and Fermi choices for particle statistics. This suggests supersymmetric extension of original Dirac's theory in which Bose and Fermi single-component positive-energy Dirac fields are combined into a doublet whose members can transform into each other. Our model includes a Landau-Anderson-Higgs type potential which allows spontaneous selection of the universe with a given bose-to-fermi ratio of the positive-energy Dirac particles. The bosonic sector of proposed extension hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that endows the universe with its cosmological temporal asymmetry. In the massless case of Dirac's original theory, we explore the possibility of allowing the field expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency modes. This leads to the anticommutation relations for creation and annihilation operators associated with the negative energy solutions, resulting in supersymmetric behavior of the single-component field in the ultrarelativistic limit. Finally, we speculate on the possibility for the positive-energy Dirac particles to obey some exotic (such as non-abelian, Clifford) statistics in which the particles are neither created nor destroyed.</description>

      <title>Space-time symmetry breaking on non-geodesic leaves and a new form of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the permanent damage caused by the historical breakdown of full diffeomorphism invariance induced by a foliation. We focus on the case where the foliation is allowed to be non-geodesic after the interactions with the foliation switch off. Gravity and other forms of matter recover full diffeomorphism invariance only at the expense of introducing a new matter-like component, carrying the non-vanishing Hamiltonian (and momentum, as it turns out) left over from the violating past interactions. This matter form must be stress-free in the preferred frame; this is the only way a matter action can mimic the evolution of the leftover Hamiltonian (and momentum) driven by the Dirac hypersurface deformation algebra. Hence, if the preferred frame is non-geodesic, the equivalent matter component must have energy and a momentum current in this frame, but still no spatial stresses: an unusual form of "matter". It is equivalent to a fluid with anisotropic stress in some regimes, reducing to dust in others, or even displaying completely new features in extreme situations. Its stress energy tensor is conserved. We provide two examples based on accelerated frames: Rindler space-time and the canonical Schwarzchild frame.</description>

      <title>Scalar probes on wormholes in Lovelock theories with unique vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.02089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new family of wormhole geometries in Lovelock theories with a unique vacuum, and study their stability under scalar field perturbations. As the solutions already known in the literature for Chern-Simons gravity on AdS, the new wormholes are characterized by a single integration constant $\rho_{0}$, that parameterizes the contribution to the mass coming from each boundary, which cancel each other, leading to a new example of "mass without mass". The stability of these new configurations, as well as other previously constructed in the literature is explored under scalar field perturbations. The stability is ensured provided the mass of the scalar perturbation is above a deformed Breitenlohner-Freedman bound which is sensitive to the value of $\rho_{0}$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information can provide a lens for characterizing the operational implications of spacetime physics. A well-known result in this area is that quantum entanglement is degraded in the vicinity of a black hole. This result treats the black hole and its spacetime as classical. But what if these were to be treated quantum-mechanically? Here, we show that quantum coherence in black hole, and thus spacetime, degrees of freedom can limit the degradation of entanglement, thereby improving the performance of nearby quantum communication protocols. This finding indicates that quantum features of spacetime could serve as resources for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We derive the predicted time dilation of delocalized atomic clocks in an optical lattice setup in the presence of a gravitational field to leading order in quantum relativistic corrections. We investigate exotic quantum states of motion whose relativistic time dilation is outside of the realm of classical general relativity, finding a regime where $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ optical lattice clocks currently in development would comfortably be able to detect this quantum effect (if the technical challenge of generating such states can be met and the expected accuracy of such clocks can be attained). We provide a detailed experimental protocol and analyse the effects of noise on our predictions. We also show that the magnitude of our predicted quantum relativistic time dilation effect remains just out of detectable reach for the current generation of $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}$ optical lattice clocks. Our calculations agree with the predicted time dilation of classical general relativity when restricting to Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Parameter Inference on Accreting White Dwarf Binaries using Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting binary white dwarf systems are among the sources expected to emanate gravitational waves that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect. We investigate how accurately the binary parameters may be measured from LISA observations. We complement previous studies by performing our parameter estimation on binaries containing a low-mass donor with a thick, hydrogen-rich envelope. The evolution is followed from the early, pre-period minimum stage, in which the donor is non-degenerate, to a later, post-period minimum stage with a largely degenerate donor. We present expressions for the gravitational wave amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative in terms of white dwarf parameters (masses, donor radius, etc.), where binary evolution is driven by gravitational wave radiation and accretion torques, and the donor radius and logarithmic change in radius ($\eta_{\rm d}$) due to mass loss are treated as model parameters. We then perform a Fisher analysis to reveal the accuracy of parameter measurements, using models from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to estimate realistic fiducial values at which we evaluate the measurement errors. We find that the donor radius can be measured relatively well with LISA observations alone, while we can further measure the individual masses if we have an independent measurement of the luminosity distance from electromagnetic observations. When applied to the parameters of the recently-discovered white dwarf binary ZTF J0127+5258, our Fisher analysis suggests that we will be able to constrain the system's individual masses and donor radius using LISA's observations, given ZTF's measurement of the luminosity distance.</description>

Abstract: Observations of the high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by the hot and massive remnant of a binary neutron star merger will provide new probes of the dense-matter equation of state (EoS). We show that current uncertainties in the thermal physics can cause the emergent GW spectum to differ by a degree comparable to changing the cold EoS by $\pm\sim120$ m in the characteristic radius of a neutron star. Unless a very close binary neutron star merger takes place, these effects are unlikely to be measurable with current GW detectors. However, with proposed next-generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, the effects can be distinguished for events at distances of up to ~80-200 Mpc, if the cold EoS is sufficiently well constrained.</description>

      <title>Soft synchronous gauge in the perturbative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An attempt to directly use the synchronous gauge ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) in perturbative gravity leads to a singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. This is similar to the singularity in the propagator for Yang-Mills fields $A^a_\lambda$ in the temporal gauge ($A^a_0 = 0$). There the singularity was softened, obtaining this gauge as the limit at $\varepsilon \to 0$ of the gauge $n^\lambda A^a_\lambda = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $. Then the singularities at $p_0 = 0$ are replaced by negative powers of $p_0 \pm i \varepsilon$, and thus we bypass these poles in a certain way.
  Now consider a similar condition on $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu}$ in perturbative gravity, which becomes the synchronous gauge at $\varepsilon \to 0$. Unlike the Yang-Mills case, the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the effective action is nonzero, and we calculate it. In this calculation, an intermediate regularization is needed, and we assume the discrete structure of the theory at short distances for that. The effect of this contribution is to change the functional integral measure or, for example, to add non-pole terms to the propagator. This contribution vanishes at $\varepsilon \to 0$. Thus, we effectively have the synchronous gauge with the resolved singularities at $p_0 = 0$, where only the physical components $g_{j k}$ are active and there is no need to calculate the ghost contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>

      <title>Topological classes of thermodynamics of the rotating charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of rotating charged AdS black holes in both four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravity theories. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of the thermodynamical topological approach to black holes, utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy. We demonstrate that the number of rotation parameters plays a significant role in determining the topological numbers of five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes. Moreover, our findings indicate that the topological numbers of both four- and five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes are not influenced by the number of electric charge parameters. This highlights a distinct difference in how rotation and electric charge parameters impact the thermodynamic topological properties of these black holes.</description>

      <title>Dualities Among Massive, Partially Massless and Shift Symmetric Fields on (A)dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We catalog all the electromagnetic-like dualities that exist between free dynamical bosonic fields of arbitrary symmetry type and mass on (anti-) de Sitter space in all dimensions, including dualities among the partially massless and shift symmetric fields. This generalizes to all these field types the well known fact that a massless $p$-form is dual to a massless $(D-p-2)$-form in $D$ spacetime dimensions. In the process, we describe the structure of the Weyl modules (the spaces of local operators linear in the fields and their derivative relations) for all the massive, partially massless and shift symmetric fields.</description>

Abstract: We argue that the well-known beta functions of quadratic gravity do not correspond to the physical dependence of scattering amplitudes on external momenta, and derive the correct physical beta functions. Asymptotic freedom turns out to be compatible with the absence of tachyons.</description>

      <title>Repeating Nuclear Transients as Candidate Electromagnetic Counterparts of LISA Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the primary targets for the recently adopted millihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatory LISA. Some previous studies have argued that a fraction of all EMRIs form in matter-rich environments, and can potentially explain the dozens of soft X-ray band ($\sim 10^{-1} \rm keV$), low-frequency ($\sim 0.1$ mHz) periodic phenomena known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Here, using a representative EMRI population retrofitted with cutoffs on LISA-band SNRs and luminosity distances to account for the sensitivity of current instruments, we estimate the mean frequency band in which QPEs and QPOs originating from detectable LISA EMRIs may be emitting an X-ray signal ``today'' (i.e., in 2024) to be $0.46 \pm 0.22$ mHz. We also model the well-known QPO source, RE J1034+396, which falls in this frequency band, as an EMRI assuming its primary black hole mass to be $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$. Through a prior-predictive analysis, we estimate the orbiting compact object's mass to be $46^{+ 10}_{-40} M_\odot$ and the source's LISA-band SNR as $\approx 14$, highlighting it as a candidate multi-messenger EMRI target. We also highlight the role of current and near-future X-ray and UV observatories in enabling multi-messenger observations of EMRIs in conjunction with LISA, and conclude with a discussion of caveats of the current analysis, such as the exclusion of eccentricity and inclination from the model, and the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Higher-curvature gravity in AdS$_3$, holographic $c$-theorems and black hole microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct higher-derivative gravity theories in three dimensions that admit holographic $c$-theorems and exhibit a unique maximally symmetric vacuum, at arbitrary order $n$ in the curvature. We show that these theories exhibit special properties, the most salient ones being the decoupling of ghost modes around Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the enhancement of symmetries at linearized level, and the existence of a one-parameter generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole that, while being asymptotically AdS, is not of constant curvature but rather exhibits a curvature singularity. For such black holes, we provide a holographic derivation of their thermodynamics. This gives a microscopic picture of black hole thermodynamics for non-supersymmetric solutions, of non-constant curvature in higher-derivative theories of arbitrary order in the curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be $2.08\pm0.07\,\rm M_\odot$. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021) reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 17 April 2020, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 28 December 2021 was presented in Salmi et al. (2022). Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 21 April 2022, totaling $\sim1.1$ Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021), and to data from X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is $12.92_{-1.13}^{+2.09}$ km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty $\sim83\%$ the width of that reported in Miller et al. (2021), in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al. (2024), then our 68% credible region would become $R=12.76^{+1.49}_{-1.02}$ km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. (2024). Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study of the aforementioned features where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>
