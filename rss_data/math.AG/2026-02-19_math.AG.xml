      <title>Topology of the Vakil--Zinger moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a set of generators for the rational homology of the desingularised genus one mapping space $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r,d)$ constructed by Vakil--Zinger and qualitatively describe the relations among the generators. The results build on a detailed study of the stratifications of the moduli spaces coming from tropical geometry and the constraints coming from the weight filtration on the Borel--Moore homology groups of strata, extending the techniques from the previous study on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}.$ Our results imply that the even homology of $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r,d)$ is tautological and controlled by genus-zero and reduced genus-one Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the Hodge and Tate conjectures for $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r,d),$ completely describe its rational Picard group, and recover known results on the vanishing of odd cohomology. Our techniques also apply to the pure weight homology groups of genus one stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r,d).$</description>

      <title>Algebraic and analytic structure of Morikawa's sangaku problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu(r)$ denote the minimal side length of a square inscribed in the curvilinear triangular region formed by two tangent circles of radii $1$ and $r \ge 1$ together with their common tangent line. The problem of finding a closed-form expression for $\mu(r)$ was posed in early nineteenth-century Japan by Morikawa. It was proved by Holly and Krumm (2021) that no expression in radicals exists for $\mu(r)$. In this article we show that $\mu$ is an algebraic function, and consequently real-analytic on $[1,\infty)$ outside a finite explicitly computable set. In particular, although no expression in radicals exists, the function admits convergent Taylor expansions at all non-exceptional values of $r$, whose coefficients may be computed by Newton iteration from the defining algebraic equation. We illustrate the method by explicitly computing the Taylor expansion of $\mu(r)$ centered at $r=1$.</description>

      <title>Proof of Miyanishi's conjecture on endomorphisms of varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $X$ is a quasi-projective variety over a field $k$ and $\phi$ a birational endomorphism of $X$ that is injective outside a closed subset of codimension $\geq 2$, we prove that $\phi$ is an automorphism. This generalizes an old theorem of Ax and proves a conjecture of Miyanishi. A key step in our proof is a finiteness result on class groups, which is of interest in its own right.</description>

      <title>On the Enestrom-Kakeya Theorem for polynomials of an octonionic variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the zeros of octonionic polynomials, we generalize the well-known Enestrom-Kakeya Theorem to the case of octonions. In this paper, we first deal with octonionic polynomials with nonnegative and monotonic coefficients, and prove that its zero set is contained within the closed sphere of octonion space. Then, we also consider the octonionic polynomials which the coefficients muduli is monotonic and the real parts of the coefficients is monotonic respectively, and get some results.</description>

      <title>The jet schemes of the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ and analytic properties of the Chevalley map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove dimension bounds on the jet schemes of the variety of nilpotent matrices (and of related varieties) in positive characteristic.
  This result has applications to the analytic properties of the Chevalley map that sends a matrix to its characteristic polynomial. We show that our dimension bound implies, under the assumption of existence of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, that the Chevalley map pushes a smooth compactly supported measure to a measure whose density function is $L^t$ for any $t&lt;\infty$.
  We also prove this analytic property of the Chevalley map, unconditionally, when the characteristic of the field exceeds $n/2$.
  The zero characteristic counterpart of this result is an important step in the proof of the celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem. In a sequel work [AGKSb], we show that also in positive characteristic, this analytic statement implies Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem for cuspidal representations of the general linear group.</description>

      <title>Invertible top form on the Hilbert scheme of a plane in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Hilbert scheme of the plane in positive characteristic admits an invertible top differential form.
  This implies certain integrability properties of the symmetric powers of the plane. This allows to define a function on the collection of monic polynomials over a local field which can be thought of as a variant of the inverse square root of the discriminant. In characteristic 0 it essentially coincides with this inverse square root, however in general it is quite different, and unlike this inverse square root, it is locally summable. In a sequel work [AGKS] we use this local summability in order to prove the positive characteristic analog of Harish-Chandra's local integrability theorem of characters of representations under certain conditions.
  The main results of this paper are known in characteristic zero. In fact a stronger result is known: there is a symplectic form on the Hilbert scheme of a plane.</description>

      <title>Effective local differential topology of algebraic varieties over local fields of positive characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a framework for quantitative statements on distances and measures when studying algebraic varieties and morphisms of algebraic varieties over local fields.
  We will concentrate on local fields of the type $\mathbb{F}_\ell((t))$ and work uniformly with respect to finite extensions of $\mathbb{F}_\ell$.
  In this framework we prove analogues of standard results from local differential topology, including the implicit function theorem and study the behavior of smooth measures under push forward with respect to submersions.</description>

      <title>Positive Charts of Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct affine charts of a smooth projective toric variety which contain its nonnegative points, and which admit a closed embedding into the total coordinate space of Cox's quotient construction. We show that such positive charts arise from smooth subcones of the nef cone. To each positive chart we associate an algebraic moment map, the fibers of which are the critical points of a monomial function in Cox coordinates. This work provides a toric framework for the theory of $u$-equations in positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Hurwitz Spaces in Mixed and Positive Characteristic with Wild Ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new logarithmic Hurwitz spaces $\mathcal{LH}^{\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}}_A$ and $\mathcal{LH}^{\mathbb{F}_{p}}_{A,\Xi}$ over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ and $\mathbb{F}_p$ respectively that in the mixed characteristic case can be considered as a compactification of the admissible cover stack parametrizing ramified covers of curves in characteristic $0$ of degree $p$ and in the equicharacteristic case compactify the space of separable maps between smooth curves of degree $p$.
  These Hurwitz spaces will carry a logarithmic structure and to emphasize that they are informative, we prove that in some first cases our Hurwitz spaces are log smooth. To achieve this, we introduce various Moduli spaces that parametrize Artin-Schreier covers and the locus of zeroes and poles of certain differential forms, show their smoothness and compute their dimension.</description>

Abstract: We classify projective terminalizations of quotients of Fano varieties of lines on smooth cubic fourfolds by finite groups of symplectic automorphisms of the underlying cubic. We compute the second Betti number and the fundamental group of the regular locus. As a consequence, we identify two new deformation classes of four-dimensional irreducible holomorphic symplectic varieties with second Betti number equal to four and simply connected regular locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a smooth complex irreducible projective variety of dimension $n \geq 2$ and $H$ be an ample line bundle on $X$. In this paper, we construct families of $\mu_H$-stable vector bundles on $X$ having fixed determinant and rank $r$, which are generated by $r+1$ global sections, parametrized by Grassmanian varieties. This gives into the corresponding moduli spaces special subvarieties birational to Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>On the Coupled Cluster Doubles Truncation Variety of Four Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent algebro-geometric results for coupled cluster theory of quantum many-body systems to the truncation varieties arising from the doubles approximation (CCD), focusing on the first genuinely nonlinear doubles regime of four electrons. Since this doubles truncation variety does not coincide with previously studied varieties, we initiate a systematic investigation of its basic algebro-geometric invariants. Combining theoretical and numerical results, we show that for $4$ electrons on $n\leq 12$ orbitals, the CCD truncation variety is a complete intersection of degree $2^{\binom{n-4}{4}}$. Using representation-theoretic arguments, we uncover a Pfaffian structure governing the quadratic relations that define the truncation variety for any $n$, and show that an exact tensor product factorization holds in a distinguished limit of disconnected doubles. We connect these structural results to the computation of the beryllium insertion into molecular hydrogen ({Be$\cdots$H$_2$ $\to$ H--Be--H}), a small but challenging bond formation process where multiconfigurational effects become pronounced.</description>

      <title>Level structures on cyclic covers of $\mathbb{P}^n$ and the homology of Fermat hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Z'\subset \mathbb{P}^{n}$ be a smooth projective hypersurface of degree $d&gt;1$ and let $Z\to \mathbb{P}^n$ be the $\mu_d$-cover totally ramified along $Z'$. We relate full level $d$ structures on the primitive cohomology $Z'$ with full level $d$ structures on the primitive cohomology of $Z$. In the special case, $d=n=3$ this makes a marking of a smooth cubic surface determine a level $3$-structure on the associated cubic threefold, thereby answering a question by Beauville. We expect many more such applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we extend the notion of determinantal representation of hypersurfaces to the determinantal representation of sections of the determinant line bundle of a vector bundle. We give several examples, and prove some necessary conditions for existence of determinantal representation. As an application, we show that for any integer $d \geq 1,$ there is an indecomposable vector bundle $E_d$ of rank $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$ such that almost all curves of degree $d$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ arise as the degeneracy loci of a pair of holomorphic sections of $E_d$, upto an automorphism of $\mathbb{P}^2$. We use this result to obtain a linear algebraic application.</description>

      <title>Invariant Algebraic $D$-Modules on Connected Reductive Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10934v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-rank left-translation invariant algebraic $D$-modules on complex affine algebraic groups. Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections.
  We prove our main results for semisimple groups, for general linear groups, and more generally for connected reductive groups. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case. For a connected reductive group, we relate invariant $D$-modules via pullback along the abelianization map. We also derive applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems for semisimple groups.</description>

      <title>On the Jacobian of $\overline{{{\rm Spec}\,\mathbb Z}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We interpret the structure of the adele class space of the rationals--and specifically its Riemann sector--as the natural monoidal extension of the Picard group of the arithmetic curve $\overline{\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb Z}$. We identify the elements of this space with torsion-free rank-1 abelian groups $L$ endowed with rigidifying data. In the Riemann sector, this data corresponds to a norm, extending the classical notion of metrized line bundles in Arakelov geometry. For the full adele class space, we replace the norm with a group morphism to $\mathbb R$ and a combinatorial datum: a parametrization of the roots of unity associated with the character dual of $L$. We show that the product of adeles is represented geometrically by the tensor product of these rank-1 groups and their rigidifying structures. The resulting monoid space generalizes the Picard group to the full adelic context by incorporating the singular strata required for the spectral realization of $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Heine-Shephard problem for four lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the set of square-free parts of volume polynomials associated with four planar lattice polytopes. This is motivated by the problem of describing possible pairwise intersection numbers of four curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ with prescribed Newton polytopes and generic coefficients. It is known that for arbitrary convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the corresponding square-free polynomials are characterized by the Pl\"ucker-type inequalities. We show that this characterization fails in the lattice setting: the interior of the space defined by the Pl\"ucker-type inequalities contains integer polynomials that are and are not realizable by lattice polytopes. This phenomenon arises from additional arithmetic constraints on the mixed areas of lattice polytopes. These constraints become apparent when we study a "discrete diagram", which maps a pair of planar lattice polytopes to their mixed area together with their lattice widths in a given direction.</description>

      <title>On Toric Ideals Arising from the Chip-Firing Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain groups and ideals arising from the chip-firing game on a generalisation of graphs called pargraphs. Several well-known families of toric ideals, including those defining rational normal curves and binomial edge ideals of complete graphs, arise as toppling ideals of pargraphs. We provide sufficient conditions under which the toppling ideal of a pargraph to be toric. In addition, we construct a Gr\"obner basis for the toppling ideal, a minimal cellular free resolution for a distinguished initial ideal known as the $G$-parking function ideal, and establish Cohen-Macaulay property for these ideals. We also study the Picard group of a pargraph and provide sufficient conditions ensuring its freeness.</description>

      <title>Intersections of special cycles on Shimura curves and Siegel Maass forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the generating series of the number of pairs of geodesics on a compact Shimura curve with given discriminants and intersection angle are coefficients of a non-holomorphic Siegel modular form, a theta lift of the constant function. This retrieves and generalizes counting results of Rickards via the Siegel-Weil formula.
  More generally, we study the genus two theta lift of Maass forms on this Shimura curve and prove a Fourier-Taylor expansion in terms of some generalized Whittaker functions. We also provide a geometric interpretation of all Fourier coefficients of these theta lifts in terms of averages of geodesic Taylor coefficients over special cycles.</description>

      <title>On coefficients, potentially abelian quotients, and residual irreducibility of compatible systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\rho_\lambda:G_K\rightarrow GL_n(\overline E_\lambda)\}$ be a semisimple E-rational compatible system of a number field K. In a first step, building upon the theory of pseudocharacters [Ro96],[Ch14], we attach to each $\rho_\lambda$ an algebraic monodromy group $G_\lambda$ defined over $E_\lambda$ and also prove that the compatible system can be descended to a strongly E'-rational compatible system $\{\rho_{\lambda'}: G_K\rightarrow GL_n(E'_{\lambda'})\}$ for some finite extension E'/E. Secondly, we demonstrate that the maximal potentially abelian quotient of $G_\lambda$ is independent of $\lambda$ in a strong sense. Finally, as an application, we generalize a result of Patrikis--Snowden--Wiles on residual irreducibility of compatible systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perverse schobers are categorifications of perverse sheaves. In prior work we constructed a perverse schober on a partial compactification of the stringy K\"ahler moduli space (SKMS) associated by Halpern-Leistner and Sam to a quasi-symmetric representation of a reductive group. When the group is a torus the SKMS corresponds to the complement of the GKZ discriminant locus (which is a hyperplane arrangement in the quasi-symmetric case shown by Kite). We show here that a suitable variation of the perverse schober we constructed provides a categorification of the associated GKZ hypergeometric system in the case of non-resonant parameters. As an intermediate result we give a description of the monodromy of such "quasi-symmetric" GKZ hypergeometric systems.</description>

      <title>Regulators in the Arithmetic of Function Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a natural sequel to the study of A-motivic cohomology initiated in "On the integral part of A-motivic cohomology", we develop a notion of regulator for rigid analytically trivial Anderson A-motives. In accordance with the conjectural picture over number fields, we define it as the morphism at the level of extension modules induced by the exactness of the Hodge-Pink realization functor. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we prove a finiteness result for A-motivic cohomology; second, under a weight assumption, we show that the source and the target of the regulator have the same dimension. It came as a surprise to the author that the image of this regulator may fail to have full rank, thereby preventing an analogue of Beilinson's celebrated conjecture from holding in our setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove the local motivic monodromy conjecture for singularities that are nondegenerate with respect to a simplicial Newton polyhedron. It follows that all poles of the local topological zeta functions of such singularities correspond to eigenvalues of monodromy acting on the cohomology of the Milnor fiber of some nearby point, as do the poles of Igusa's local $p$-adic zeta functions for large primes $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Fourier-Mukai equivalences of (families of) abelian varieties and K3 surfaces in positive and mixed characteristics. We first prove in any characteristics that Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian varieties are again abelian varieties. We subsequently focus on the canonical lifts of ordinary abelian varieties and ordinary K3 surfaces. For such schemes, we show that Fourier-Mukai equivalences on the special fibers can be lifted to the canonical lifts. We also prove that the relative Fourier-Mukai partners of the canonical lifts are in bijection with the Fourier-Mukai partners of the special fibers. We conclude by demonstrating that the last result can be used to recover the ordinary case of a result originally proved by Honigs, Lombardi and Tirabassi.</description>

Examples of these actions can be found in the rational homogeneous framework. We prove that the subvariety of ${\mathcal C}X$ parametrizing reducible torus-invariant cycles is a simple normal crossing divisor, we compute the Nef and Mori cones of ${\mathcal C}X$, and its anticanonical divisor.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies affine algebraic varieties parametrized by sine and cosine functions, generalizing algebraic Lissajous figures in the plane. We show that, up to a combinatorial factor, the degree of these varieties equals the volume of a polytope. We deduce defining equations from rank constraints on a matrix with polynomial entries. We discuss applications of Lissajous varieties in dynamical systems, in particular the Kuramoto model. This leads us to study connections with convex optimization and Lissajous discriminants.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the representation-theoretic structure of the Koszul cohomology of a smooth projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, admitting an action of a finite group $G$ of order coprime to ${\rm char}(k)$. Properties of $G$-equivariant functors are employed to show that the associated Koszul complex is a complex of $kG$-modules, and to generalize known dimension formulas to identities between virtual representations. In the case of canonical curves, explicit formulas are obtained by combining the theory of equivariant Euler characteristics and equivariant Riemann-Roch theorems with that of generating functions for Schur functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant weight-graded and topological Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d \to \mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of degree-$d$ line bundles over $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$. We prove that in the weight-zero and topological cases, the generating function for Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d$ is obtained from the corresponding one for $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ by an extremely simple combinatorial transformation. This lets us deduce closed formulas for the two generating functions, taking as input the Chan--Faber--Galatius--Payne formula in the weight-zero case and Gorsky's formula in the topological case. As an immediate corollary, we obtain closed formulas for the weight-zero and topological Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}^d_g$. Our weight-zero calculations follow from a general result passing from the weight-graded Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ to those of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g,n}^d$.</description>

Abstract: We find an explicit $S_n$-equivariant bijection between the integral points in a certain zonotope in $\mathbb{R}^n$, combinatorially equivalent to the permutahedron, and the set of $m$-parking functions of length $n$. This bijection restricts to a bijection between the regular $S_n$-orbits and $(m,n)$-Dyck paths, the number of which is given by the Fuss-Catalan number $A_{n}(m,1)$. Our motivation came from studying tilting bundles on noncommutative Hilbert schemes. As a side result we use these tilting bundles to construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category of noncommutative Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Closure operations induced via resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fact that the structure sheaf of a resolution of singularities, or regular alteration, pushes forward to a Cohen-Macaulay complex in equal characteristic zero with a differential graded algebra structure, we introduce a tight-closure-like operation on ideals in equal characteristic zero using the Koszul complex, which we call KH (Koszul-Hironaka). We prove it satisfies various strong colon capturing properties, a substantial case of the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem, and it behaves well under finite extensions. It detects rational singularities and is tighter than tight closure in equal characteristic zero. Furthermore, its formation commutes with localization and it can be computed effectively. On the other hand, the product of the KH closures of ideals is not always contained in the KH of the product, as one might expect.
  We also explore a related closure operation (canonical alteration closure), induced by canonical modules of regular alterations, which detects KLT-type singularities in equal characteristic zero and which is closely related to tight closure in characteristic $p &gt; 0$. For parameter ideals we show both these closure operations coincide and reduce modulo $p \gg 0$ to tight closure. Finally, we explore an intermediate operation (Hironaka pre-closure) which which satisfies numerous desired properties, but for which we have not been able to prove idempotence.</description>

Abstract: The moduli space of graphs $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ is a polyhedral object that mimics the behavior of the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$, $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ of (stable) Riemann surfaces; this relationship has been made precise in several different ways, which collectively identify $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ as the "tropicalization" of $M_{g,n}$. We describe how this relationship lifts to some objects that live over $M_{g,n}$ (like Teichm\"uller space) and that live over $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ (like the Culler-Vogtmann space $CV_{g,n}^*$). We introduce the notion of a stable complex handlebody, and show that $CV_{g,n}^*$ can be viewed as the tropicalization of a certain complex manifold $hT(V_{g,n})$ that parametrizes complex handlebodies. An important ingredient is our construction of a partial compactification $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})\supset hT(V_{g,n})$, which we prove is a simply connected complex manifold with simple normal crossings boundary. When $n=0$, $hT(V_{g,n})$ coincides with the moduli space of Schottky groups, $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})$ coincides with Gerritzen-Herrlich's extended Schottky space, and $CV_{g,0}^*$ is the simplicial completion of the original Outer space. The resulting picture fits together many familiar objects from geometric group theory and surface topology, including Harvey's curve complex, mapping class groups of surfaces and handlebodies, and augmented Teichm\"uller space. Many of the relationships between the objects that we see in this picture already exist in the literature, but we add some new ones, and generalize several existing relationships to include a number $n&gt;0$ of punctures/leaves.</description>

      <title>E-Strings and Four-Manifolds</title>

Abstract: We investigate the physics of the E-string theory and its compactifications as well as their applications to four-dimensional topology. In particular, we compute the partition function of the topologically twisted theory on $M_4\times T^2$, where $M_4$ is a four-manifold. In a range of examples, we verify that this partition function, as a $q$-series, 1) has integral coefficients, 2) is modular, and 3) can be lifted to a topological modular form. Remarkably, the E-string theory "knows" about various subtle aspects of the world of smooth 4-manifolds, as the (topological) modularity of the partition function is contingent on a collection of properties of 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten invariants, including, notably, the simple-type conjecture. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical evidences indicate that this partition function defines a genuine smooth invariant, even when $b_2^+\le 1$. Therefore, the E-string theory may offer powerful new tools for exploring regions in the geography of 4-manifolds that have been inaccessible to existing invariants obtained from gauge theory and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Skein Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits in its Lie algebra. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</description>
