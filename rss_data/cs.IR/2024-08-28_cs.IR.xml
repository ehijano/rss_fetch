      <title>Relationships are Complicated! An Analysis of Relationships Between Datasets on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Web today has millions of datasets, and the number of datasets continues to grow at a rapid pace. These datasets are not standalone entities; rather, they are intricately connected through complex relationships. Semantic relationships between datasets provide critical insights for research and decision-making processes. In this paper, we study dataset relationships from the perspective of users who discover, use, and share datasets on the Web: what relationships are important for different tasks? What contextual information might users want to know? We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of relationships between datasets on the Web and map these relationships to user tasks performed during dataset discovery. We develop a series of methods to identify these relationships and compare their performance on a large corpus of datasets generated from Web pages with schema.org markup. We demonstrate that machine-learning based methods that use dataset metadata achieve multi-class classification accuracy of 90%. Finally, we highlight gaps in available semantic markup for datasets and discuss how incorporating comprehensive semantics can facilitate the identification of dataset relationships. By providing a comprehensive overview of dataset relationships at scale, this paper sets a benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unpacking the Hidden Challenges in Knowledge Distillation for Online Ranking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a powerful approach for compressing a large model into a smaller, more efficient model, particularly beneficial for latency-sensitive applications like recommender systems. However, current KD research predominantly focuses on Computer Vision (CV) and NLP tasks, overlooking unique data characteristics and challenges inherent to recommender systems. This paper addresses these overlooked challenges, specifically: (1) mitigating data distribution shifts between teacher and student models, (2) efficiently identifying optimal teacher configurations within time and budgetary constraints, and (3) enabling computationally efficient and rapid sharing of teacher labels to support multiple students. We present a robust KD system developed and rigorously evaluated on multiple large-scale personalized video recommendation systems within Google. Our live experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in student model performance while ensuring consistent and reliable generation of high quality teacher labels from a continuous data stream of data.</description>

      <title>Federated User Preference Modeling for Privacy-Preserving Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the data-sparsity problem by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing CDR methods generally assume that the user-item interaction data is shareable between domains, which leads to privacy leakage. Recently, some privacy-preserving CDR (PPCDR) models have been proposed to solve this problem. However, they primarily transfer simple representations learned only from user-item interaction histories, overlooking other useful side information, leading to inaccurate user preferences. Additionally, they transfer differentially private user-item interaction matrices or embeddings across domains to protect privacy. However, these methods offer limited privacy protection, as attackers may exploit external information to infer the original data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated User Preference Modeling (FUPM) framework. In FUPM, first, a novel comprehensive preference exploration module is proposed to learn users' comprehensive preferences from both interaction data and additional data including review texts and potentially positive items. Next, a private preference transfer module is designed to first learn differentially private local and global prototypes, and then privately transfer the global prototypes using a federated learning strategy. These prototypes are generalized representations of user groups, making it difficult for attackers to infer individual information. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks conducted on the Amazon and Douban datasets validate the superiority of FUPM over SOTA baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Lili1013/FUPM.</description>

      <title>Smart Multi-Modal Search: Contextual Sparse and Dense Embedding Integration in Adobe Express</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As user content and queries become increasingly multi-modal, the need for effective multi-modal search systems has grown. Traditional search systems often rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while multi-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image embeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating contextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable multi-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper presents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that optimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template search. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles of embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse embeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense, and contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly reduces null rates (over 70\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our findings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems, thereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.</description>

      <title>Graph and Sequential Neural Networks in Session-based Recommendation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of recommendation systems (RSs) in alleviating the information overload problem. As a new paradigm of RSs, session-based recommendation (SR) specializes in users' short-term preference capture and aims to provide a more dynamic and timely recommendation based on the ongoing interacted actions. In this survey, we will give a comprehensive overview of the recent works on SR. First, we clarify the definitions of various SR tasks and introduce the characteristics of session-based recommendation against other recommendation tasks. Then, we summarize the existing methods in two categories: sequential neural network based methods and graph neural network (GNN) based methods. The standard frameworks and technical are also introduced. Finally, we discuss the challenges of SR and new research directions in this area.</description>

      <title>Tripl\`etoile: Extraction of Knowledge from Microblogging Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous methods and pipelines have recently emerged for the automatic extraction of knowledge graphs from documents such as scientific publications and patents. However, adapting these methods to incorporate alternative text sources like micro-blogging posts and news has proven challenging as they struggle to model open-domain entities and relations, typically found in these sources. In this paper, we propose an enhanced information extraction pipeline tailored to the extraction of a knowledge graph comprising open-domain entities from micro-blogging posts on social media platforms. Our pipeline leverages dependency parsing and classifies entity relations in an unsupervised manner through hierarchical clustering over word embeddings. We provide a use case on extracting semantic triples from a corpus of 100 thousand tweets about digital transformation and publicly release the generated knowledge graph. On the same dataset, we conduct two experimental evaluations, showing that the system produces triples with precision over 95% and outperforms similar pipelines of around 5% in terms of precision, while generating a comparatively higher number of triples.</description>

      <title>MRSE: An Efficient Multi-modality Retrieval System for Large Scale E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing high-quality item recall for text queries is crucial in large-scale e-commerce search systems. Current Embedding-based Retrieval Systems (ERS) embed queries and items into a shared low-dimensional space, but uni-modality ERS rely too heavily on textual features, making them unreliable in complex contexts. While multi-modality ERS incorporate various data sources, they often overlook individual preferences for different modalities, leading to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we propose MRSE, a Multi-modality Retrieval System that integrates text, item images, and user preferences through lightweight mixture-of-expert (LMoE) modules to better align features across and within modalities. MRSE also builds user profiles at a multi-modality level and introduces a novel hybrid loss function that enhances consistency and robustness using hard negative sampling. Experiments on a large-scale dataset from Shopee and online A/B testing show that MRSE achieves an 18.9% improvement in offline relevance and a 3.7% gain in online core metrics compared to Shopee's state-of-the-art uni-modality system.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Discovery in Optical Music Recognition: Enhancing Information Retrieval with Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) automates the transcription of musical notation from images into machine-readable formats like MusicXML, MEI, or MIDI, significantly reducing the costs and time of manual transcription. This study explores knowledge discovery in OMR by applying instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN to enhance the detection and delineation of musical symbols in sheet music. Unlike Optical Character Recognition (OCR), OMR must handle the intricate semantics of Common Western Music Notation (CWMN), where symbol meanings depend on shape, position, and context. Our approach leverages instance segmentation to manage the density and overlap of musical symbols, facilitating more precise information retrieval from music scores. Evaluations on the DoReMi and MUSCIMA++ datasets demonstrate substantial improvements, with our method achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of up to 59.70\% in dense symbol environments, achieving comparable results to object detection. Furthermore, using traditional computer vision techniques, we add a parallel step for staff detection to infer the pitch for the recognised symbols. This study emphasises the role of pixel-wise segmentation in advancing accurate music symbol recognition, contributing to knowledge discovery in OMR. Our findings indicate that instance segmentation provides more precise representations of musical symbols, particularly in densely populated scores, advancing OMR technology. We make our implementation, pre-processing scripts, trained models, and evaluation results publicly available to support further research and development.</description>

      <title>Measuring publication relatedness using controlled vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications has important applications in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness because they address issues that arise when using citation or textual similarity to measure relatedness. While several controlled-vocabulary-based relatedness measures have been developed, there exists no comprehensive and direct test of their accuracy and suitability for different types of research questions. This paper reviews existing measures, develops a new measure, and benchmarks the measures using TREC Genomics data as a ground truth of topics. The benchmark test show that the new measure and the measure proposed by Ahlgren et al. (2020) have differing strengths and weaknesses. These results inform a discussion of which method to choose when studying interdisciplinarity, information retrieval, clustering of science, and researcher topic switching.</description>

      <title>X-Reflect: Cross-Reflection Prompting for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>MODOC: A Modular Interface for Flexible Interlinking of Text Retrieval and Text Generation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) produce eloquent texts but often the content they generate needs to be verified. Traditional information retrieval systems can assist with this task, but most systems have not been designed with LLM-generated queries in mind. As such, there is a compelling need for integrated systems that provide both retrieval and generation functionality within a single user interface.
  We present MODOC, a modular user interface that leverages the capabilities of LLMs and provides assistance with detecting their confabulations, promoting integrity in scientific writing. MODOC represents a significant step forward in scientific writing assistance. Its modular architecture supports flexible functions for retrieving information and for writing and generating text in a single, user-friendly interface.</description>

      <title>KGPrune: a Web Application to Extract Subgraphs of Interest from Wikidata with Analogical Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become ubiquitous publicly available knowledge sources, and are nowadays covering an ever increasing array of domains. However, not all knowledge represented is useful or pertaining when considering a new application or specific task. Also, due to their increasing size, handling large KGs in their entirety entails scalability issues. These two aspects asks for efficient methods to extract subgraphs of interest from existing KGs. To this aim, we introduce KGPrune, a Web Application that, given seed entities of interest and properties to traverse, extracts their neighboring subgraphs from Wikidata. To avoid topical drift, KGPrune relies on a frugal pruning algorithm based on analogical reasoning to only keep relevant neighbors while pruning irrelevant ones. The interest of KGPrune is illustrated by two concrete applications, namely, bootstrapping an enterprise KG and extracting knowledge related to looted artworks.</description>

      <title>Snap and Diagnose: An Advanced Multimodal Retrieval System for Identifying Plant Diseases in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant disease recognition is a critical task that ensures crop health and mitigates the damage caused by diseases. A handy tool that enables farmers to receive a diagnosis based on query pictures or the text description of suspicious plants is in high demand for initiating treatment before potential diseases spread further. In this paper, we develop a multimodal plant disease image retrieval system to support disease search based on either image or text prompts. Specifically, we utilize the largest in-the-wild plant disease dataset PlantWild, which includes over 18,000 images across 89 categories, to provide a comprehensive view of potential diseases relating to the query. Furthermore, cross-modal retrieval is achieved in the developed system, facilitated by a novel CLIP-based vision-language model that encodes both disease descriptions and disease images into the same latent space. Built on top of the retriever, our retrieval system allows users to upload either plant disease images or disease descriptions to retrieve the corresponding images with similar characteristics from the disease dataset to suggest candidate diseases for end users' consideration.</description>

      <title>Personalized Video Summarization using Text-Based Queries and Conditional Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of video content on platforms like YouTube and Vimeo presents significant challenges in efficiently locating relevant information. Automatic video summarization aims to address this by extracting and presenting key content in a condensed form. This thesis explores enhancing video summarization by integrating text-based queries and conditional modeling to tailor summaries to user needs. Traditional methods often produce fixed summaries that may not align with individual requirements. To overcome this, we propose a multi-modal deep learning approach that incorporates both textual queries and visual information, fusing them at different levels of the model architecture. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1-score assess the quality of the generated summaries. The thesis also investigates improving text-based query representations using contextualized word embeddings and specialized attention networks. This enhances the semantic understanding of queries, leading to better video summaries. To emulate human-like summarization, which accounts for both visual coherence and abstract factors like storyline consistency, we introduce a conditional modeling approach. This method uses multiple random variables and joint distributions to capture key summarization components, resulting in more human-like and explainable summaries. Addressing data scarcity in fully supervised learning, the thesis proposes a segment-level pseudo-labeling approach. This self-supervised method generates additional data, improving model performance even with limited human-labeled datasets. In summary, this research aims to enhance automatic video summarization by incorporating text-based queries, improving query representations, introducing conditional modeling, and addressing data scarcity, thereby creating more effective and personalized video summaries.</description>

      <title>Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.</description>

      <title>Into the Unknown Unknowns: Engaged Human Learning through Participation in Language Model Agent Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While language model (LM)-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.</description>

      <title>From Variability to Stability: Advancing RecSys Benchmarking Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09766</link>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of Recommender Systems (RecSys), new algorithms frequently claim state-of-the-art performance based on evaluations over a limited set of arbitrarily selected datasets. However, this approach may fail to holistically reflect their effectiveness due to the significant impact of dataset characteristics on algorithm performance. Addressing this deficiency, this paper introduces a novel benchmarking methodology to facilitate a fair and robust comparison of RecSys algorithms, thereby advancing evaluation practices. By utilizing a diverse set of $30$ open datasets, including two introduced in this work, and evaluating $11$ collaborative filtering algorithms across $9$ metrics, we critically examine the influence of dataset characteristics on algorithm performance. We further investigate the feasibility of aggregating outcomes from multiple datasets into a unified ranking. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we validate the reliability of our methodology under the variability of datasets, offering a benchmarking strategy that balances quality and computational demands. This methodology enables a fair yet effective means of evaluating RecSys algorithms, providing valuable guidance for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Explain then Rank: Scale Calibration of Neural Rankers Using Natural Language Explanations from LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In search settings, calibrating the scores during the ranking process to quantities such as click-through rates or relevance levels enhances a system's usefulness and trustworthiness for downstream users. While previous research has improved this notion of calibration for low complexity learning-to-rank models, the larger data demands and parameter count specific to modern neural text rankers produce unique obstacles that hamper the efficacy of methods intended for the learning-to-rank setting.
  This paper proposes exploiting large language models (LLMs) to provide relevance and uncertainty signals for these neural text rankers to produce scale-calibrated scores through Monte Carlo sampling of natural language explanations (NLEs). Our approach transforms the neural ranking task from ranking textual query-document pairs to ranking corresponding synthesized NLEs. Comprehensive experiments on two popular document ranking datasets show that the NLE-based calibration approach consistently outperforms past calibration methods and LLM-based methods for ranking, calibration, and query performance prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy-Guided Zero-Shot Recommendations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to perform a variety of tasks, their application in recommender systems (RecSys) has shown promise. However, we are facing significant challenges when deploying LLMs into RecSys, such as limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and un-constrained generation of recommendations, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method using a taxonomy dictionary. This method provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, we achieve efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. Our Taxonomy-guided Recommendation (TaxRec) approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches, showcasing its efficacy as personal recommender with LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/yueqingliang1/TaxRec.</description>

      <title>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available at https://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON. The results confirm the model's ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</description>

      <title>RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated their advantages in alleviating the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing RAG benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating whether LLMs can correctly answer the general knowledge. However, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG system in dealing with the data from different vertical domains. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework for automatically generating evaluation datasets to evaluate the knowledge usage ability of different LLMs in different scenarios. Specifically, RAGEval summarizes a schema from seed documents, applies the configurations to generate diverse documents, and constructs question-answering pairs according to both articles and configurations. We propose three novel metrics, Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance, to carefully evaluate the responses generated by LLMs. By benchmarking RAG models in vertical domains, RAGEval has the ability to better evaluate the knowledge usage ability of LLMs, which avoids the confusion regarding the source of knowledge in answering question in existing QA datasets--whether it comes from parameterized memory or retrieval. The code and dataset will be released.</description>
