      <title>A Note About Majority Colorings of Countable DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A majority coloring of an undirected graph is a vertex coloring in which for each vertex there are at least as many bi-chromatic edges containing that vertex as monochromatic ones. It is known that for every countable graph a majority 3-coloring always exists. The Unfriendly Partition Conjecture states that every countable graph admits a majority 2-coloring. Since the 3-coloring result extends to countable DAGs, a variant of the conjecture states that 2 colors are enough to majority color every countable DAG. We show that this is false by presenting a DAG for which 3 colors are necessary. Presented construction is strongly based on a StackExchange conversation regarding labellings of infinite graphs that is linked in the references.</description>

      <title>A Nearly Optimal Deterministic Algorithm for Online Transportation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new deterministic algorithm called Subtree-Decomposition for the online transportation problem and show that the algorithm is $(8m-5)$-competitive, where $m$ is the number of server sites.
  It has long been known that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is lower bounded by $2m-1$ for this problem. On the other hand, the conjecture proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs in 1998 asking whether a deterministic $(2m-1)$-competitive algorithm exists for the online transportation problem has remained open for over two decades.
  The upper bound on the competitive ratio, $8m-5$, which is the result of this paper, is the first to come close to this conjecture, and is the best possible within a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation, which consists of removing an edge shared by two triangles and replacing it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>

      <title>Realizability of Subgroups by Subshifts of Finite Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of realizing families of subgroups as the set of stabilizers of configurations from a subshift of finite type (SFT). This problem generalizes both the existence of strongly and weakly aperiodic SFTs. We show that a finitely generated normal subgroup is realizable if and only if the quotient by the subgroup admits a strongly aperiodic SFT. We also show that if a subgroup is realizable, its subgroup membership problem must be decidable. The article also contains the introduction of periodically rigid groups, which are groups for which every weakly aperiodic subshift of finite type is strongly aperiodic. We conjecture that the only finitely generated periodically rigid groups are virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ groups and torsion-free virtually $\mathbb{Z}^2$ groups. Finally, we show virtually nilpotent and polycyclic groups satisfy the conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors. Various architectures have been proposed to address this ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures. Notable examples include GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices, or other invariant spectral features. However, the potential expressive power of these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear. The goal of this work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable when using spectral features. We first introduce a unified message-passing framework for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN). A comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent to EPNN. A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is also established. On the other hand, we prove that EPNN itself is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL. Finally, we discuss whether using spectral features can gain additional expressiveness when combined with more expressive GNNs.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal solution sets for metric graph problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems from metric graph theory like Metric Dimension, Geodetic Set, and Strong Metric Dimension have recently had a strong impact in parameterized complexity by being the first known problems in NP to admit double-exponential lower bounds in the treewidth, and even in the vertex cover number for the latter, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We initiate the study of enumerating minimal solution sets for these problems and show that they are also of great interest in enumeration. Specifically, we show that enumerating minimal resolving sets in graphs and minimal geodetic sets in split graphs are equivalent to enumerating minimal transversals in hypergraphs (denoted Trans-Enum), whose solvability in total-polynomial time is one of the most important open problems in algorithmic enumeration. This provides two new natural examples to a question that emerged in recent works: for which vertex (or edge) set graph property $\Pi$ is the enumeration of minimal (or maximal) subsets satisfying $\Pi$ equivalent to Trans-Enum? As very few properties are known to fit within this context -- namely, those related to minimal domination -- our results make significant progress in characterizing such properties, and provide new angles to approach Trans-Enum. In contrast, we observe that minimal strong resolving sets can be enumerated with polynomial delay. Additionally, we consider cases where our reductions do not apply, namely graphs with no long induced paths, and show both positive and negative results related to the enumeration and extension of partial solutions.</description>

      <title>Threshold rates for properties of random codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $P$ is a property that may be satisfied by a random code $C \subset \Sigma^n$. For example, for some $p \in (0,1)$, ${P}$ might be the property that there exist three elements of $C$ that lie in some Hamming ball of radius $pn$. We say that $R^*$ is the threshold rate for ${P}$ if a random code of rate $R^* + \epsilon$ is very likely to satisfy ${P}$, while a random code of rate $R^* - \epsilon$ is very unlikely to satisfy ${P}$. While random codes are well-studied in coding theory, even the threshold rates for relatively simple properties like the one above are not well understood.
  We characterize threshold rates for a rich class of properties. These properties, like the example above, are defined by the inclusion of specific sets of codewords which are also suitably "symmetric". For properties in this class, we show that the threshold rate is in fact equal to the lower bound that a simple first-moment calculation obtains. Our techniques not only pin down the threshold rate for the property ${P}$ above, they give sharp bounds on the threshold rate for list-recovery in several parameter regimes, as well as an efficient algorithm for estimating the threshold rates for list-recovery in general.</description>
