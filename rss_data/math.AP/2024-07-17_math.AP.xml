      <title>Sub-Riemannian Navier-Stokes system on the Heisenberg group: Weak solutions, well-posedness and smoothing effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the derivation of the incompressible sub-Riemannian Euler and the sub-Riemannian Navier-Stokes systems, and the analysis of the last one in the case of the Heisenberg group. In contrast to the classical Navier-Stokes system in the Euclidean setting, the diffusion is not elliptic but only hypoelliptic, and the commutator of the Leray projector and the hypoelliptic Laplacian is of order two. Yet, we study the existence of solutions in two different settings: within the $L^2$ setting which provides global existence of weak solutions; within a critical scale-invariant Sobolev-type space, associated with the regularity of the generators of the first stratum of the Lie algebra of right-invariant vector fields. In this latter class, we establish global existence of solutions for small data and a stability estimate in the energy spaces which ensures the uniqueness of the solutions in this class. Furthermore, we show in this setting that these solutions instantly become analytic in the vertical direction. Surprisingly, we obtain a larger lower bound of the radius of analyticity in the vertical direction for large times than for the usual incompressible Navier-Stokes system in the Euclidean setting. Finally, using the structure of the system, we recover the $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ smoothness in the other directions by using the analyticity in the vertical variable.</description>

      <title>Small and large data scattering for the dispersion-managed NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several scattering results for dispersion-managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we establish small-data scattering for both `intercritical' and `mass-subcritical' powers by suitable modifications of the standard approach via Strichartz estimates. In addition, we prove scattering for arbitrary data in a weighted Sobolev space for intercritical powers by establishing a pseudoconformal energy estimate. We also rule out (unmodified) scattering for sufficiently low powers. Finally, we give some remarks concerning blowup for the focusing equation.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for a volume-filling model of cell invasion into extracellular matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11228v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions for a model of cell invasion into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which consists of a non-linear partial differential equation for the density of cells, coupled with an ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing the ECM density. The model contains cross-species density-dependent diffusion and proliferation terms that capture the role of the ECM in providing structural support for the cells during invasion while also preventing growth via volume-filling effects. Furthermore, the model includes ECM degradation by the cells. We present an existence result for weak solutions which is based on carefully exploiting the partial gradient flow structure of the problem which allows us to overcome the non-regularising nature of the ODE involved.
  In addition, we present simulations based on a finite difference scheme that illustrate that the system exhibits travelling wave solutions, and we investigate numerically the asymptotic behaviour as the ECM degradation rate tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>$L_p$-estimates for parabolic equations in divergence form with a half-time derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the unique solvability of solutions in Sobolev spaces to linear parabolic equations in a more general form than those in the literature. A distinguishing feature of our equations is the inclusion of a half-order time derivative term on their right-hand side. We anticipate that such equations will prove useful in various problems involving time evolution terms. Notably, the coefficients of the equations exhibit significant irregularity, being merely measurable with respect to the temporal variable or one spatial variable.</description>

      <title>Normalized solution for $p$-Laplacian equation in exterior domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are devoted to the study of the following nonlinear $p$-Laplacian Schr\"odinger equation with $L^{p}$-norm constraint \begin{align*} \begin{cases} &amp;-\Delta_{p} u=\lambda |u|^{p-2}u +|u|^{r-2}u\quad\mbox{in}\quad\Omega,\\ &amp;u=0\quad\mbox{on}\quad \partial\Omega,\\ &amp;\int_{\Omega}|u|^{p}dx=a, \end{cases} \end{align*} where $\Delta_{p}u=\text{div} (|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an exterior domain with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega\neq\emptyset$ satisfying that $\R^{N}\setminus\Omega$ is bounded, $N\geq3$, $2\leq p&lt;N$, $p&lt;r&lt;p+\frac{p^{2}}{N}$, $a&gt;0$ and $\lambda\in\R$ is an unknown Lagrange multiplier. First, by using the splitting techniques and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, the compactness of Palais-Smale sequence of the above problem at higher energy level is established. Then, exploiting barycentric function methods, Brouwer degree and minimax principle, we obtain a solution $(u,\la)$ with $u&gt;0$ in $\R^{N}$ and $\la&lt;0$ when $\R^{N}\setminus\Omega$ is contained in a small ball. Moreover, we give a similar result if we remove the restriction on $\Omega$ and assume $a&gt;0$ small enough. Last, with the symmetric assumption on $\Omega$, we use genus theory to consider infinite many solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we recall various existing kinetic models of non-reactive polyatomic gases. We also review the results, all recently obtained, about the compactness of the associated linearized Boltzmann operator, and briefly investigate the mixture case. Eventually, with a specific collision kernel, we present a discussion about the physical relevance of the assumptions used to obtain the compactness results.</description>

      <title>Continuous time Markov chain based approximation of stationary and weak KAM Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main objects of the paper are stationary and weak KAM Hamilton-Jacobi equations on the finite-dimensional torus. The key idea of the paper is to replace the underlying calculus of variations problems with continuous time Markov decision problems. This directly leads to an approximation of the stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation by the Bellman equation for a discounting Markov decision problem. Developing elements of the weak KAM theory for the Markov decision problem, we obtain an approximation of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, convergences of the functional parts of the discrete weak KAM equations and Mather measures are shown. It turns out that the approximating equations are systems of algebraic equations. Thus, the paper's result can be seen as numerical schemes for stationary and weak KAM Hamilton-Jacobi equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics for a diffusive epidemic model with a free boundary: sharp asymptotic profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the sharp asymptotic profiles of the solution of a diffusive epidemic model with one free boundary and one fixed boundary which is subject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and Neumann boundary condition, respectively. The longtime behaviors has been proved to be governed by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy in \cite{LL}, and when spreading happens, the spreading speed is determined in \cite{LLW}. In this paper, by constructing some subtle upper and lower solutions, as well as employing some detailed analysis, we improve the results in \cite{LLW} and obtain the sharp asymptotic spreading profiles, which show the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and Neumann boundary condition imposed at the fixed boundary $x=0$ lead to the same asymptotic behaviors of $h(t)$ and $(u,v)$ near the spreading front $h(t)$.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium diffusion approximation for the radiative transfer equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the distribution of the temperature within a body where the heat is transported only by radiation. Specifically, we consider the situation where both emission-absorption and scattering processes take place. We study the initial boundary value problem given by the coupling of the radiative transfer equation with the energy balance equation on a convex domain $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $ in the diffusion approximation regime, i.e. when the mean free path of the photons tends to zero. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions we will derive the limit initial boundary value problems for all different possible scaling limit regimes and we will classify them as equilibrium or non-equilibrium diffusion approximation. Moreover, we will observe the formation of boundary and initial layers for which suitable equations are obtained. We will consider both stationary and time dependent problems as well as different situations in which the light is assumed to propagate either instantaneously or with finite speed.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and Riemannian Structure in the Gromov-Wasserstein Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wasserstein space of probability measures is known for its intricate Riemannian structure, which underpins the Wasserstein geometry and enables gradient flow algorithms. However, the Wasserstein geometry may not be suitable for certain tasks or data modalities. Motivated by scenarios where the global structure of the data needs to be preserved, this work initiates the study of gradient flows and Riemannian structure in the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) geometry, which is particularly suited for such purposes. We focus on the inner product GW (IGW) distance between distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a functional $\mathsf{F}:\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)\to\mathbb{R}$ to optimize, we present an implicit IGW minimizing movement scheme that generates a sequence of distributions $\{\rho_i\}_{i=0}^n$, which are close in IGW and aligned in the 2-Wasserstein sense. Taking the time step to zero, we prove that the discrete solution converges to an IGW generalized minimizing movement (GMM) $(\rho_t)_t$ that follows the continuity equation with a velocity field $v_t\in L^2(\rho_t;\mathbb{R}^d)$, specified by a global transformation of the Wasserstein gradient of $\mathsf{F}$. The transformation is given by a mobility operator that modifies the Wasserstein gradient to encode not only local information, but also global structure. Our gradient flow analysis leads us to identify the Riemannian structure that gives rise to the intrinsic IGW geometry, using which we establish a Benamou-Brenier-like formula for IGW. We conclude with a formal derivation, akin to the Otto calculus, of the IGW gradient as the inverse mobility acting on the Wasserstein gradient. Numerical experiments validating our theory and demonstrating the global nature of IGW interpolations are provided.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layers for Stokes Systems in Periodic Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotics of boundary layers in periodic homogenization. The analysis is focused on a Stokes system with periodic coefficients and periodic Dirichlet data posed in the half-space $\{y\in \mathbb{R}^d: y\cdot n -s&gt;0\}$. In particular, we establish the convergence of the velocity as $y\cdot n \rightarrow \infty$. We obtain this convergence for arbitrary normals $n\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Moreover, we build an asymptotic expansion of Poisson's kernel for the periodically oscillating Stokes operator in the half-space.</description>

Abstract: We give an alternative proof and some extensions of results of Carlier, Figalli and Santambrogio on polynomial upper bounds on the Brenier map between probability measures under various conditions on the densities. The proofs are based on the monotonicity of the map and various concentration inequalities, as already used by Colombo and Fathi to prove quadratic growth for transport maps from the standard Gaussian onto log-concave measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of branched immersed 2-spheres with prescribed mean curvature, with controlled Morse index and with arbitrary codimensions in closed Riemannian manifold $N$ admitting finite fundamental group, where $\pi_k(N) \neq 0$ and $k \geq 2$, for certain generic choice of prescribed mean curvature vector. Moreover, we enhance this existence result to encompass all possible choices of prescribed mean curvatures under certain Ricci curvature condition on $N$ when $\dim{N} = 3$. When $\dim{N} \geq 4$, we establish a Morse index lower bound while $N$ satisfies some isotropic curvature condition. As a consequence, we can leverage latter strengthened result to construct 2-spheres with parallel mean curvature when $N$ has positive isotropic curvature and $\dim{N} \geq 4$. At last, we partially resolve the homotopy problem concerning the existence of a representative surface with prescribed mean curvature type vector field in some given homotopy classes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the wave and Klein-Gordon equations on the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ ($n \geq2$) in a framework based on weak-$L^{p}$ spaces. First, we establish dispersive estimates on Lorentz spaces in the context of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Then, employing those estimates, we prove global well-posedness of solutions and an exponential asymptotic stability property. Moreover, we develop a scattering theory and construct wave operators in such singular framework.</description>

      <title>Guided modes in a hexagonal periodic graph like domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of guided waves and edge states in particular two-dimensional media obtained by perturbing a reference periodic medium with honeycomb symmetry. This reference medium is a thin periodic domain (the thickness is denoted $\delta$ \&amp;gt; 0) with an hexagonal structure, which is close to an honeycomb quantum graph. In a first step, we show the existence of Dirac points (conical crossings) at arbitrarily large frequencies if $\delta$ is chosen small enough. We then perturbe the domain by cutting the perfectly periodic medium along the so-called zigzag direction, and we consider either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the cut edge. In the two cases, we prove the existence of edges modes as well as their robustness with respect to some perturbations, namely the location of the cut and the thickness of the perturbed edge. In particular, we show that different locations of the cut lead to almost-non dispersive edge states, the number of locations increasing with the frequency. All the results are obtained via asymptotic analysis and semi-explicit computations done on the limit quantum graph. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We address the well-posedness of subelliptic Fokker-Planck equations arising from stochastic control problems, as well as the properties of the associated diffusion processes. Here, the main difficulty arises from the possible polynomial growth of the coefficients, which is related to the growth of the family of vector fields generating the first layer of the associated Lie algebra. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the energy solution, and its representation as the transition density of the underlying subelliptic diffusion process. Moreover, we show its Holder continuity in time w.r.t.the Fortet-Mourier distance, where the Holder seminorm depends on the degree of homogeneity of the vector fields. Finally, we provide a probabilistic proof of the Feyman-Kac formula, as a consequence of the uniform boundedness in finite time intervals of all moments.</description>

      <title>Thom's gradient conjecture for nonlinear evolution equations</title>

Abstract: R. Thom's gradient conjecture states that if a gradient flow of an analytic function converges to a limit, it does so along a unique limiting direction. In this paper, we extend and settle this conjecture in the context of infinite dimensional problems. Building on the foundational works of {\L}ojasiewicz, L. Simon, and the resolution of the conjecture for finite dimensional cases by Kurdyka-Mostowski-Parusinski, we focus on nonlinear evolutions on Riemannian manifolds as studied by L. Simon. This framework includes geometric PDEs such as minimal surface, harmonic map, mean curvature flow, and normalized Yamabe flow. Our main result not only confirms the uniqueness of the limiting direction but also characterizes the rate of convergence and possible limiting directions for both classical and infinite dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear Robin problems for harmonic and polyharmonic functions in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existence and global regularity results for boundary-value problems of Robin type for harmonic and polyharmonic functions in $n$-dimensional half-spaces are offered. The Robin condition on the normal derivative on the boundary of the half-space is prescribed by a nonlinear function $\mathcal N$ of the relevant harmonic or polyharmonic functions. General Orlicz type growths for the function $\mathcal N$ are considered. For instance, functions $\mathcal N$ of classical power type, their perturbations by logarithmic factors, and exponential functions are allowed. New sharp boundedness properties in Orlicz spaces of some classical operators from harmonic analysis, of independent interest, are critical for our approach.</description>

Abstract: In this note we show existence and regularity of periodic tilings of the Euclidean space into equal cells containing a ball of fixed radius, which minimize either the classical or the fractional perimeter. We also discuss some qualitative properties of minimizers in dimensions $3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness of generalized nonlinear wave equations on the lattice graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel first-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, and establish its weak (1, 1) estimate as well as strong (p, p) estimate for p &gt; 1 in weighted spaces. This derivative is designed to reconstruct the discrete Laplacian, enabling an extension of the theory of nonlinear wave equations, including quasilinear wave equations, to lattice graphs. We prove the local well-posedness of generalized quasilinear wave equations and the long-time well-posedness of these equations for small initial data. Furthermore, we prove the global well-posedness of defocusing semilinear wave equations for large initial data.</description>

      <title>A moment approach for entropy solutions of parameter-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to solve parameter-dependent hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a moment approach, based on a previous work from Marx et al. (2020). This approach relies on a very weak notion of solution of nonlinear equations, namely parametric entropy measure-valued (MV) solutions, satisfying linear equations in the space of Borel measures. The infinite-dimensional linear problem is approximated by a hierarchy of convex, finite-dimensional, semidefinite programming problems, called Lasserre's hierarchy. This gives us a sequence of approximations of the moments of the occupation measure associated with the parametric entropy MV solution, which is proved to converge. In the end, several post-treatments can be performed from this approximate moments sequence. In particular, the graph of the solution can be reconstructed from an optimization of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel associated with the approximate measure, that is a powerful approximation tool able to capture a large class of irregular functions. Also, for uncertainty quantification problems, several quantities of interest can be estimated, sometimes directly such as the expectation of smooth functionals of the solutions. The performance of our approach is evaluated through numerical experiments on the inviscid Burgers equation with parametrised initial conditions or parametrised flux function.</description>
