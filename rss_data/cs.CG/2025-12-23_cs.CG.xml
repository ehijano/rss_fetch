      <title>BlockSets: A Structured Visualization for Sets with Large Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizations of set systems frequently use enclosing geometries for the sets in combination with reduced representations of the elements, such as short text labels, small glyphs, or points. Hence they are generally unable to adequately represent sets whose elements are larger text fragments, images, or charts. In this paper we introduce BlockSets, a novel set visualization technique specifically designed for sets with large elements. BlockSets places the elements on a grid and uses rectilinear shapes as enclosing geometries. We describe integer linear programs that find high-quality layouts of the elements on the grid. Since not all set systems allow a compact contiguous representation in this form, we also present an algorithm that splits the visualization into parts when needed; our visual encoding highlights the parts for the user in the final visualization. BlockSets utilizes orthoconvex shapes which offer a good trade-off between compactness and readability. Finally, BlockSets renders the enclosing geometries as stacked opaque shapes. We describe an algorithm that finds a stacking order such that all shapes can be inferred. Such a stacking does not have to exist, but our algorithm did find a stacking for all real-world data sets that we tested.</description>

      <title>Finding Cliques in Geometric Intersection Graphs with Grounded or Stabbed Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric intersection graph is constructed over a set of geometric objects, where each vertex represents a distinct object and an edge connects two vertices if and only if the corresponding objects intersect. We examine the problem of finding a maximum clique in the intersection graphs of segments and disks under grounded and stabbed constraints. In the grounded setting, all objects lie above a common horizontal line and touch that line. In the stabbed setting, all objects can be stabbed with a common line.
  - We prove that finding a maximum clique is NP-hard for the intersection graphs of upward rays. This strengthens the previously known NP-hardness for ray graphs and settles the open question for the grounded segment graphs. The hardness result holds in the stabbed setting.
  - We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable for intersection graphs of grounded unit-length segments, but NP-hard for stabbed unit-length segments.
  - We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the case of grounded disks. If the grounded constraint is relaxed, then we give an $O(n^3 f(n))$-time $3/2$-approximation for disk intersection graphs with radii in the interval $[1,3]$, where $n$ is the number of disks and $f(n)$ is the time to compute a maximum clique in an $n$-vertex cobipartite graph. This is faster than previously known randomized EPTAS, QPTAS, or 2-approximation algorithms for arbitrary disks. We obtain our result by proving that pairwise intersecting disks with radii in $[1,3]$ are 3-pierceable, which extends the 3-pierceable property from the long known unit disk case to a broader class.</description>

      <title>On The Computational Complexity for Minimizing Aerial Photographs for Full Coverage of a Planar Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of drone technologies, aerial photography have become prevalent in many daily scenarios such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, law enforcement etc. A central challenge in this domain is the efficient coverage of a target area with photographs that can entirely capture the region, while respecting constraints such as the image resolution, and limited number of pictures that can be taken. This work investigates the computational complexity of several fundamental problems arised from this challenge. By abstracting the aerial photography problem into the coverage problems in computational geometry, we demonstrate that most of these problems are in fact computationally intractable, with the implication that traditional algorithms cannot solve them efficiently. The intuitions of this work can extend beyond aerial photography to broader applications such as pesticide spraying, and strategic sensor placement.</description>

      <title>Construction and deformation of P-hedra using control polylines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 19th International Symposium on Advances in Robot Kinematics the author introduced a novel class of continuous flexible discrete surfaces and mentioned that these so-called P-hedra (or P-nets) allow direct access to their spatial shapes by three control polylines. In this follow-up paper we study this intuitive method, which makes these flexible planar quad surfaces suitable for transformable design tasks by means of interactive tools. The construction of P-hedra from the control polylines can also be used for an efficient algorithmic computation of their isometric deformations. In addition we discuss flexion limits, bifurcation configurations, developable/flat-foldable pattern and tubular P-hedra.</description>

      <title>Computing the Fr\'echet Distance When Just One Curve is $c$-Packed: A Simple Almost-Tight Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study approximating the continuous Fr\'echet distance of two curves with complexity $n$ and $m$, under the assumption that only one of the two curves is $c$-packed. Driemel, Har{-}Peled and Wenk DCG'12 studied Fr\'echet distance approximations under the assumption that both curves are $c$-packed. In $\mathbb{R}^d$, they prove a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(d \, c\,\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon})$ time. Bringmann and K\"unnemann IJCGA'17 improved this to $\tilde{O}(c\,\frac{n + m }{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$ time, which they showed is near-tight under SETH. Recently, Gudmundsson, Mai, and Wong ISAAC'24 studied our setting where only one of the curves is $c$-packed. They provide an involved $\tilde{O}( d \cdot (c+\varepsilon^{-1})(cn\varepsilon^{-2} + c^2m\varepsilon^{-7} + \varepsilon^{-2d-1}))$-time algorithm when the $c$-packed curve has $n$ vertices and the arbitrary curve has $m$, where $d$ is the dimension in Euclidean space. In this paper, we show a simple technique to compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in time $O(d \cdot c\,\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon})$ when one of the curves is $c$-packed. Our approach is not only simpler than previous work, but also significantly improves the dependencies on $c$, $\varepsilon$, and $d$. Moreover, it almost matches the asymptotically tight bound for when both curves are $c$-packed. Our algorithm is robust in the sense that it does not require knowledge of $c$, nor information about which of the two input curves is $c$-packed.</description>
