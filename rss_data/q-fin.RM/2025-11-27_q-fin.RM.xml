      <title>The Quantum Network of Assets: A Non-Classical Framework for Market Correlation and Structural Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical correlation matrices capture only linear and pairwise co-movements, leaving higher-order, nonlinear, and state-dependent interactions of financial markets unrepresented. This paper introduces the Quantum Network of Assets (QNA), a density-matrix based framework that embeds cross-asset dependencies into a quantum-information representation. The approach does not assume physical quantum effects but uses the mathematical structure of density operators, entropy, and mutual information to describe market organisation at a structural level.
  Within this framework we define two structural measures: the Entanglement Risk Index (ERI), which summarises global non-separability and the compression of effective market degrees of freedom, and the Quantum Early-Warning Signal (QEWS), which tracks changes in entropy to detect latent information build-up. These measures reveal dependency geometry that classical covariance-based tools cannot capture.
  Using NASDAQ-100 data from 2024-2025, we show that quantum entropy displays smoother evolution and clearer regime distinctions than classical entropy, and that ERI rises during periods of structural tightening even when volatility remains low. Around the 2025 US tariff announcement, QEWS shows a marked pre-event increase in structural tension followed by a sharp collapse after the announcement, indicating that structural transitions can precede price movements without implying predictive modelling.
  QNA therefore provides a structural diagnostic of market fragility, regime shifts, and latent information flow. The framework suggests new directions for systemic risk research by linking empirical asset networks with tools from quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Informative Risk Measuresin the Banking Industry: A Proposal based on the Magnitude-Propensity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research in risk management, most of the literature has focused on scalar risk measures (like e.g. Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall). While such scalar measures provide compact and tractable summaries, they provide a poor informative value as they miss the intrinsic multivariate nature of risk.To contribute to a paradigmatic enhancement, and building on recent theoretical work by Faugeras and Pag\'es (2024), we propose a novel multivariate representation of risk that better reflects the structure of potential portfolio losses, while maintaining desirable properties of interpretability and analytical coherence. The proposed framework extends the classical frequency-severity approach and provides a more comprehensive characterization of extreme events. Several empirical applications based on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility, robustness and practical relevance of the methodology, suggesting its potential for both regulatory and managerial applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal dividend and capital injection under self-exciting claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal dividend and capital-injection problem in a Cram\'er--Lundberg model where claim arrivals follow a Hawkes process, capturing clustering effects often observed in insurance portfolios. We establish key analytical properties of the value function and characterise the optimal capital-injection strategy through an explicit threshold. We also show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated HJB variational inequality. For numerical purposes, we first compute a benchmark solution via a monotone finite-difference scheme with Howard's policy iteration. We then develop a reinforcement learning approach based on policy-gradient and actor-critic methods. The learned strategies closely match the PDE benchmark and remain stable across initial conditions. The results highlight the relevance of policy-gradient techniques for dividend optimisation under self-exciting claim dynamics and point toward scalable methods for higher-dimensional extensions.</description>
