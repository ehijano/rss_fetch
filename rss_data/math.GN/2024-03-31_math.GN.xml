      <title>On Traditional Menger and Rothberger Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on the relationships between variations of the Menger and Rothberger selection properties with respect to $\omega$-covers and $k$-covers in the most general topological setting and address the finite productivity of some of these properties. We collect various examples that separate certain properties and we carefully identify which separation axioms simplify aspects of these properties. We finish with a consolidated list of open questions focused on topological examples.</description>

      <title>A self-similar set with non-locally connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luo, Rao and Xiong [Topol. Appl. 322 (2022), 108271] conjectured that if a planar self-similar iterated function system with the open set condition does not involve rotations or reflections, then every connected component of the attractor is locally connected. We create a homogeneous counterexample of Lalley-Gatzouras type, which disproves this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Separation of plane sets by equidistant simple closed curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if two subsets ${A}$ and ${B}$ of the plane are connected, ${A}$ is bounded, and the Euclidean distance $\rho({A},{B})$ between ${A}$ and ${B}$ is greater than zero, then for every positive $\varepsilon&lt;\rho({A},{B})$, the sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ can be separated by a simple closed curve (also known as a Jordan curve) whose points all lie at distance $\varepsilon$ from the set ${A}$. We also prove that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a connected bounded subset ${A}$ of the plane contains a simple closed curve bounding the domain containing the open $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of ${A}$. It is shown that in both statements the connectivity condition can be significantly weakened. We also show that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a nonempty bounded subset of the plane contains a simple closed curve. This result complements Morton Brown's statement that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a nonempty compact subset of the plane is contained in the union of a finite number of simple closed curves.</description>

      <title>A topology on the poset of quiver mutation classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better understand mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers (and more generally skew-symmetrizable matrices), we have constructed a topology on the set of all mutation classes of quivers which we call the mutation class topology. This topology is the Alexandrov topology induced by the poset structure on the set of mutation classes of quivers from the partial order of quiver embedding. The closed sets of our topology -- equivalently, the lower sets of the poset -- are in bijective correspondence with mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers. The mutation class space described in this paper is the unique topological space with this property. We show that this space is strictly $T_0$, connected, non-Noetherian, and that every open set is dense. We close by providing open questions from cluster algebra theory in the setting of the mutation class topology and some directions for future research.</description>
