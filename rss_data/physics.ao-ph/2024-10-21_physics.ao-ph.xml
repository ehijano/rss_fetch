      <title>Ensemble-based, large-eddy reconstruction of wind turbine inflow in a near-stationary atmospheric boundary layer through generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To validate the second-by-second dynamics of turbines in field experiments, it is necessary to accurately reconstruct the winds going into the turbine. Current time-resolved inflow reconstruction techniques estimate wind behavior in unobserved regions using relatively simple spectral-based models of the atmosphere. Here, we develop a technique for time-resolved inflow reconstruction that is rooted in a large-eddy simulation model of the atmosphere. Our "large-eddy reconstruction" technique blends observations and atmospheric model information through a diffusion model machine learning algorithm, allowing us to generate probabilistic ensembles of reconstructions for a single 10-min observational period. Our generated inflows can be used directly by aeroelastic codes or as inflow boundary conditions in a large-eddy simulation. We verify the second-by-second reconstruction capability of our technique in three synthetic field campaigns, finding positive Pearson correlation coefficient values (0.20&gt;r&gt;0.85) between ground-truth and reconstructed streamwise velocity, as well as smaller positive correlation coefficient values for unobserved fields (spanwise velocity, vertical velocity, and temperature). We validate our technique in three real-world case studies by driving large-eddy simulations with reconstructed inflows and comparing to independent inflow measurements. The reconstructions are visually similar to measurements, follow desired power spectra properties, and track second-by-second behavior (0.25 &gt; r &gt; 0.75).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Estimation of Superdroplet Growth Rates Using DNS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet growth and size spectra play a crucial role in the microphysics of atmospheric clouds. However, it is challenging to represent droplet growth rate accurately in cloud-resolving models such as Large Eddy Simulations (LESs). The assumption of "well-mixed" condition within each grid cell, often made by traditional LES solvers, typically falls short near the edges of clouds, where sharp gradients in water vapor supersaturation occur. This under-resolution of supersaturation gradients can lead to significant errors in prediction of droplet growth rate, which in turn affects the prediction of buoyancy at cloud edges, as well as forecast of precipitation. In "superdroplet" based LES model, a Lagrangian coarse-graining approach groups multiple droplets into superdroplets, each encompassing a specific number and size of actual droplets. The superdroplets are advected by the underlying LES velocity field, and the growth rate of these superdroplets is based on the filtered supersaturation field represented by the LES. To overcome the limitations of the "well-mixed" assumption, we propose a parameterization for superdroplet growth using high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. We introduce a novel clustering algorithm to map droplets in DNS fields to superdroplets. The effective supersaturation at each superdroplet location is computed by averaging the unfiltered supersaturation of the associated droplets, which may differ from the value of filtered supersaturation at the superdroplet location. We then develop a machine learning-based parameterization to relate the effective growth rate of superdroplets to other filtered DNS flow variables. Preliminary results show a promising $R^2$ value of nearly 0.9 between the predicted and true effective supersaturation values for the superdroplets, for a range of superdroplet multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Sheltering effect of various wave energy converter archetypes for offshore wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and installation costs. Wave energy converters (WECs) dampen incoming waves, producing a sheltering effect for downstream bodies. This work compares the sheltering effect of three wave energy converter architectures and one floating breakwater. The near-field wave-body interactions and the far-field energy balance are modeled using linear potential flow theory in a boundary element method solver coupled with a spectral action balance model. Array interactions as well as the effect of different WEC control schemes on the wave field are also investigated. Finally, a relationship between wave height reduction and reduction in fatigue damage over the turbine lifetime is defined. Near-field interactions affected the far-field performance between 5% and 60% depending on configuration, control scheme, and architecture. The six-body arrays of oscillating surge, point absorber, and breakwater architectures performed similarly, providing up to 5.70% wave height reduction after 0.5 nautical miles. Finally, small reductions in wave height (2%) were observed to have large reductions in monopile fatigue damage due to wave loading over the turbine lifetime (10%).</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and violations of bulk-edge correspondence in a hydrodynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence is a wide-ranging principle that applies to topological matter, as well as a precise result established in a large and growing number of cases. According to the principle, the distinctive topological properties of matter, thought of as extending indefinitely in space, are equivalently reflected in the excitations running along its boundary, when one is present. Indices encode those properties, and their values, when differing, are witness to a violation of that correspondence. We address such violations, as they are encountered in a hydrodynamic context. The model concerns a shallow layer of fluid in a rotating frame and provides a local description of waves propagating either across the oceans or along a coastline; it becomes topological when suitably modified at short distances. The edge index is sensitive to boundary conditions, as exemplified in earlier work, hence exhibiting a violation. Here we present classification of all (local, self-adjoint) boundary conditions and a parameterization of their manifold. They come in four families, distinguished in part by the degree of their underlying differential operators. Essentially, that degree counts the degrees of freedom of the hydrodynamic field that are constrained at the boundary by way of their normal derivatives. Generally, both the correspondence and its violation are typical. Within families though, the maximally possible amount of violation is increasing with its degree. Several indices of interest are charted for all boundary conditions. A single spectral mechanism for the onset of violations is furthermore identified. The role of a symmetry is investigated.</description>
