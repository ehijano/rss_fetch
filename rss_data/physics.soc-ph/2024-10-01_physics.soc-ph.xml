      <title>Probabilistic modelling of car traffic accidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of the U.S. Presidential Election to Coordinated Voter Relocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U.S. presidential elections are decided by the Electoral College, established in 1789, and designed to mitigate potential risks arising from the collusion of large groups of citizens. A statewide winner-take-all popular voting system for electors is implemented in all but two states, which has led to instances where narrow victories in key states were decisive in several recent elections. Small groups of voters can significantly impact the election, for example, through voter turnout. However, another dynamic can also influence this: a surprisingly small number of dedicated voters moving short distances across state lines. The extent to which the election's outcome is sensitive to small and well-coordinated movements of people has not been investigated in detail. Using a combination of forecasting, simulation, and optimization, we show that a candidate's probability of winning can be increased by 1% through the strategic relocation of approximately 10,000 people no farther than 100 miles from their current county of residence, less than 0.006% of the eligible voting population. Moreover, an 8% probability increase can be realized by a mere 50,000 voters relocating across state lines, or 0.03% of the voting population. Given the remarkably small number of people involved and the fact that establishing electoral residence in many states takes about a month, this coordinated relocation of voters is not nearly as challenging as previously thought. As it stands, U.S. presidential elections may be vulnerable to the exploitation of the aforementioned loophole. Therefore, we anticipate our findings will have direct consequences on policymaking and campaign strategy, as well as motivate new operations research methods within the political sciences.</description>

      <title>Mutual benefits of social learning and algorithmic mediation for cumulative culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable ecological success of humans is often attributed to our ability to develop complex cultural artefacts that enable us to cope with environmental challenges. The evolution of complex culture (cumulative cultural evolution) is usually modeled as a collective process in which individuals invent new artefacts (innovation) and copy information from others (social learning).
  This classic picture overlooks the fact that in the digital age, intelligent algorithms are increasingly mediating information between humans, with potential consequences for cumulative cultural evolution. Building on an established model of cultural evolution, we investigate the combined effects of network-based social learning and a simplistic version of algorithmic mediation on cultural accumulation. We find that algorithmic mediation has a strong impact on cultural accumulation and that this impact generally increases as social networks become less densely connected. Moreover, cultural accumulation tends to be optimal when social learning and algorithmic mediation are combined, and the optimal ratio depends on the network's density. Our modeling results are a first step towards formalising the impact of intelligent algorithms on cumulative cultural evolution within an established framework. Models of this kind will also help to uncover mechanisms of human-machine interaction in cultural contexts, guiding hypotheses for future experimental testing.</description>

      <title>The Risks of Scientific Gerontocracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much has been written about the problem of information overload in news and social media, little attention has been paid to its consequence in science. Scientific literature, however, has witnessed decades of exponential growth, to the point that the publications of the last twenty years now constitute 60% of all academic literature. This information overload is not without consequence. Our analysis reveals that, unlike other cultural products, scientific publications face unique challenges: the decreasing proportion of papers capturing large shares of researchers' attention and the slow turnover of influential papers lead to a disproportionate prominence of established works, resulting in stagnation and aging of scientific canons. To determine whether scientific hypergrowth is responsible for such ``gerontocratization of science'', we propose a generative model of paper citations based on random discovery and cumulative advantage, with a varying number of new papers each year. Our findings show that, as exponential growth intensifies, gerontocratization appears and becomes increasingly pronounced. Recognizing and understanding this mechanism is hence essential for developing targeted strategies to counteract this trend and promote a balanced and healthy renewal of scientific canons.</description>

      <title>A pair-based approximation for simplicial contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions play an important role in complex contagion processes. Mean-field approximations have been used to characterize the onset of spreading in the presence of group interactions. However, individual-based mean-field models are unable to capture correlations between different subsets of nodes, which can significantly influence the dynamics of a contagion process. In this paper, we introduce a pair-based mean-field approximation that allows to study the dynamics of a SIS model on simplicial complexes by taking into account correlations at the level of pairs of nodes. %by taking into account dynamical correlations emerging in groups of nodes. Compared to individual-based mean-field approaches, the proposed approximation yields more accurate predictions of the dynamics of contagion processes on simplicial complexes. Specifically, the pair-based mean-field approximation provides higher accuracy in predicting the extent of the region of bistability, the type of transition from disease-free to endemic state, and the average time evolution of the fraction of infected individuals. Crucially, the pair-based approximation correctly predicts that the onset of the epidemic outbreak in simplicial complexes depends on the strength of higher-order interactions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of accounting for pair correlations when investigating contagion processes in the presence of higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Collective motion using quantum-like entanglement of neighbours in perceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>
