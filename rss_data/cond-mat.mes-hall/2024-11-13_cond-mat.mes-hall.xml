      <title>Surface Exciton Polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have developed a theory describing surface exciton polariton (SEPs) that accounts for the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant connected with exciton momentum. Due to strong coupling between light and bulk excitons in the frequency separation, $\hbar\omega_{LT}$, between the longitudinal and transverse exciton, the SEP is formed and behaves at partially light and partially matter. The dispersion of the SEP was found through a combined solution of Maxwell's and Thomas-Hopfield's equations. The analytical theory describes SEPs at any bulk exciton/vacuum interface and provides its complete dispersion if one knows $\hbar\omega_{LT}$, the exciton effective mass, $M$, and the high frequency dielectric constant, $\kappa_\infty$. The presented theory is in excellent agreement with the only numerical modeling of this problem, which was conducted for SEPs at a ZnO/vacuum interface. Calculations show the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant leads to rather small broadening of the photon-like quasi-particle and suggests using SEPs for long-range coherence transfer.</description>

      <title>Tilted Light, Giant Currents: Engineering Floquet Moir\'e Patterns for Scalable Photocurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While intense laser irradiation and moir\'e engineering have independently proven powerful for tuning material properties on demand in condensed matter physics, their combination remains unexplored. Here we exploit tilted laser illumination to create spatially modulated light-matter interactions, leading to two striking phenomena in graphene. First, using two lasers tilted along the same axis, we create a quasi-1D supercell hosting a network of Floquet topological states that generate controllable and scalable photocurrents spanning the entire irradiated region. Second, by tilting lasers along orthogonal axes, we establish a 2D polarization moir\'e pattern giving rise to closed orbital propagation of Floquet states, reminiscent of bulk Landau states. These features, imprinted in the bulk of the irradiated region and controlled through laser wavelength and tilt angles, establish a new way for engineering quantum states through spatially modulated light-matter coupling.</description>

Abstract: By tailoring geometrical properties of magnetic nanocaps structures, there appear new possibilities to control its magnetic properties, such as the dynamics of magnetic vortices. Here, we develop the approach to describe the vortex dynamics on a spherical cap. The analytic results for the gyrofrequency of the vortex state are in good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall-like behavior of multidomain ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect refers to the nonlinear voltage response that is transverse to the applied electric field. Recent studies have shown that the quantum geometric quantities on Fermi surfaces serve as fundamental contributors to the nonlinear Hall effect, suggesting that the nonlinear Hall effect occurs mainly in metals. However, in this work, we demonstrate that insulators can also exhibit the nonlinear Hall effect. We find that for an insulator driven at a finite frequency, a series of frequency dependent quantum geometric quantities from the occupied bands can give rise to a nonvanishing nonlinear Hall conductivity. The nonlinear Hall conductivity is frequency dependent: at resonance, it represents the inter-band transition enabled nonlinear Hall current; near resonance, it represents the nonlinear order polarization transverse to the electric field. We further connect the nonlinear Hall conductivity to the Kleinman conjecture in nonlinear optics and point out that the nonlinear Hall effect is generally allowed in insulators given the driving frequency near resonance. For the candidate materials, we consider the biased Bernal bilayer graphene under uniaxial strain and propose polarization resolved second harmonic microscopy to detect the nonlinear Hall effect there.</description>

      <title>Protected chaos in a topological lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.</description>

      <title>Stretched-exponential stress dynamics in chain of springs and masses model of crystals: analytical results and MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of chain of springs and masses, originating from works of Schr\"odinger (1914) and Pater (1974), is found suitable as an analytical description of dynamics of layers in oriented FCC crystals. An analytical extension of that model has been provided for the case of linear-in-time ramp pressure applied to sample surface. Examples are provided of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirming the usefulness of the model in description of dynamic effects in steal 310S under pressure. For large sizes of samples and for long times, an improved version of proposed earlier interlayer potential has been provided for the use in lammps, resulting in a perfect harmonic inter-layer interaction, compensating the inclusion of higher-order terms in potential energy, proportional to x^4 . The results of MD simulations suggest that the dynamics of the model of chain of springs and masses of perfectly ordered matter is describable by stretched-exponential time functions and it is characterized by simple scaling properties in time.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering Mechanism in Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a new mechanism of nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. We develop its microscopic formulation and reveal its close connection with Berry curvature on Fermi surface. Applying our theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer induced by electronic instabilities in the natural van der Waals hetrostructure 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural van der Waals heterostructure 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ composed of alternating 1T- and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers serves as a platform for investigating the electronic correlations and layer-dependent properties of novel quantum materials. The temperature evolution of the conductivity spectra $\sigma(\omega)$ obtained through infrared spectroscopy elucidates the influence of band modifications associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) superlattice on the 1T layer, resulting in a room-temperature energy gap, $\Delta_{\rm CDW}\approx$ 0.35 eV. However, there is no gap associated to the 1H layer. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we attribute the behavior of interband transitions to the convergence of the layers, which amplifies the charge transfer from the 1T to the 1H layers, progressing as the temperature decreases. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced low-energy spectral weight and carrier density. The presence of an energy gap and the temperature-tunable charge transfer within the bulk of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ driven by layer-dependent CDW states contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of other complex compounds of transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Composite fermions and parton wavefunctions in twisted graphene on hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a twisted graphene on hexagonal Boron Nitride, the presence of a gap and the breaking of the symmetry between carbon sublattices leads to multicomponent fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) due to the electrons correlation. We report on the FQHE at filling factors nu = k/2 and nu = k/3 with nu &gt; 1, and on the composite fermions at in the nu &lt; 1 lowest landau Level nu = 4/5, 5/7 and 2/3. These fractional states can be described with a partons model, in which the electron is broken down into sub-particles each one residing in an integer quantum Hall effect state; partons are fictitious particles that, glued back together, recover the physical electrons. The parton states host exotic anyons that could potentially form building blocks of a fault-tolerant topological quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances due to current-induced magnon creation-annihilation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-spin conversion phenomena such as the spin Hall effect allow for the excitation of magnons in a magnetic layer by passing an electric current in an adjacent nonmagnetic conductor. We demonstrate that this current-induced modification of the magnon density generates an additional nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance for every magnetoresistance that depends on the magnetization. Using harmonic measurements, we evidence that these magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances dominate the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse resistance of thin Y$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$/Pt bilayers. Our results apply to both insulating and metallic magnetic layers, elucidating the dependence of the magnetoresistance on applied current and magnetic field for a broad variety of systems excited by spin currents.</description>

      <title>Estimation of spin-orbit torques in the presence of current-induced magnon creation and annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of harmonic resistance measurements of the dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) torques in Pt/CoFeB, Pt/Co, W/CoFeB, W/Co, and YIG/Pt bilayers complemented by measurements of the DL torque using the magneto-optical Kerr effect and calibrated by nitrogen vacancy magnetometry on the same devices. The magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances depend strongly on temperature and on the magnetic and transport properties of each bilayer, affecting the estimate of both the DL and FL torque. The DL torque, the most important parameter for applications, is overestimated by a factor of 2 in W/CoFeB and by one order of magnitude in YIG/Pt when not accounting for the magnonic contribution to the planar Hall resistance. We further show that the magnonic contribution can be quantified by combining measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances, thus providing a reliable method to measure the spin-orbit torques in different material systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid skin-topological effect in non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices with large Chern numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topology provides a research frontier for exploring topological phenomena, revealing novel topological effects and driving the development of emergent materials and platforms. Here, we explore the non-Hermitian Chern insulator phases and the hybrid skin-topological effects in checkerboard lattices with synthetic gauge fluxes. Such lattices can be realized in integrated silicon photonic nanocircuits and microresonators as well as in arrays of evanescently coupled helical optical waveguides. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry either $C_4$ or $C_2$. An unconventional physical mechanism is revealed as the origin of such a transition which is connected to the corner-induced scattering between the multiple chiral edge channels. These properties are enabled by the large Chern number and the rich non-Hermitian topological edge states in our system, revealing the diverse non-Hermitian topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Our design offers excellent controllability and experimental feasibility, making it appealing for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Terahertz control of surface topology probed with subatomic resolution</title>

Abstract: Light-induced phase transitions offer a method to dynamically modulate topological states in bulk complex materials. Yet, next-generation devices demand nanoscale architectures with contact resistances near the quantum limit and precise control over local electronic properties. The layered material WTe$_2$ has gained attention as a likely Weyl semimetal, with topologically protected linear electronic band crossings hosting massless chiral fermions. Here, we demonstrate a topological phase transition facilitated by light-induced shear motion of a single atomic layer at the surface of bulk WTe$_2$, thereby opening the door to nanoscale device concepts. Ultrafast terahertz fields enhanced at the apex of an atomically sharp tip resonantly couple to the key interlayer shear mode of WTe$_2$ via a ferroelectric dipole at the interface, inducing a structural phase transition at the surface to a metastable state. Subatomically resolved differential imaging, combined with hybrid-level density functional theory, reveals a shift of 7 $\pm$ 3 picometres in the top atomic plane. Tunnelling spectroscopy links electronic changes across the phase transition with the electron and hole pockets in the band structure, suggesting a reversible, light-induced annihilation of the topologically-protected Fermi arc surface states in the top atomic layer.</description>

      <title>Slow, Nanometer Light Confinement Observed in Atomically Thin TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme light confinement down to the atomic scale has been theoretically predicted for ultrathin, Ta-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we demonstrate in free-hanging 2H-TaS2 monolayers and bilayers slow light behaviour with a group velocity ~ $10^{-4}c$ and a lateral confinement ratio up to 300 at large wave vectors of $q = 0.15 \, \text{{\r{A}}}^{-1}$. Quantitative momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with an unprecedented momentum resolution of $0.0036 \, \text{{\r{A}}}^{-1}$ was used as a nanoscale optical platform. With it, momentum-dispersed, two-dimensional (2D) plasmon resonances were experimentally observed, showing a transition from 2D to 3D Coulomb interaction in the high-momentum regime, equivalent to light confinement volumes of $1\text{-}2 \, \text{nm}^3$. Remarkably, the resonant modes do not enter the electron-hole continuum, predicting even more enhanced optical field confinements for this material at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: To realize ferromagnetic semiconductors with high Curie temperature TC is still a challenge in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayers MnSe2 and Cr3Te6. In this paper, by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we proposed a way to obtain 2D high TC ferromagnetic semiconductors through element replacement in these ferromagnetic metals. High TC ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the monolayers (Mn, D)Se2 and (Cr, D)3Te6, where element D is taken as vacancy, 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal elements. For the concentrations of D from 1/9 to 1/3, there are about 10 ferromagnetic semiconductors with TC above 200 K, including (Cr5/6, W1/6)3Te6 and (Cr4/6, Mo2/6)3Te6 with TC above 300 K. In addition, Mn(Se6/8, Sb2/8)2 is also predicted to be a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with TC above 300 K. Considering the fast developments on fabrication and manipulation of 2D materials, our theoretical results propose a way to explore the high temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors from experimentally obtained 2D high temperature ferromagnetic metals through element replacement approach.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Observation of Moire potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moire superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. As the twist angle increases (decreases), the resulting MSLs tend to have a shorter (longer) wavelength pattern with in general incommensurate (com-mensurate) patterns, forming an underlying moir\'e potential depending on the twist angle. Irrespective of the commensura-bility/ incommensurability of MSLs, atomic-scale observation of the moir\'e potential is quite challenging, and the details of their interlayer interactions and the related anomalous effects such as correlated superconductivity and anomalous quan-tum Hall effects are still elusive. In this work, we show that aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy allows us to obtain atomic-scale image of the moir\'e potentials both in the commensurate and incommensurate states. For this pur-pose, we use atomically clean and strain-free hexagonal boron nitride nanolayers, which are fabricated by a chemical exfo-liation method developed especially in this work. Even in the case of incommensurate state, the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the resulting moir\'e potentials, as supported by density functional theory calcu-lations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moir\'e potential in MSLs, but it also expands the ap-plication of electron microcopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanocavities enable access to the quantum properties of matter, but are often simplified to single mode models despite their complex multimode structure. Here, we show that off-resonant plasmonic modes in fact play a crucial role in strong coupling, and determine the onset of a novel collective interaction. Our analysis reveals that $n$ strongly coupled plasmonic modes, introduce up to $n(n+1)/2$ oscillation frequencies that depend on their coupling strengths and detunings from the quantum emitter. Furthermore, we identify three distinct regions as the coupling strength increases: (1) single mode, (2) multimode, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our findings enhance the understanding of quantum dynamics in realistic plasmonic environments and demonstrate their potential to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer in light-driven quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent radiative heat flux due to started thermal radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts to radiate at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts to radiate, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux shows oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room or higher temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear anomalous transverse responses induced by Berry curvature quadrupole in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has shown that higher-order moments of the Berry curvature, e.g., Berry curvature quadrupole and hexapole moments, can produce the leading order nonlinear anomalous Hall response (NLAH) in systems with special magnetic point group symmetry. Recent experimental work has reported the observation of the Berry curvature quadrupole-induced third-order NLAH (i.e., Hall voltage proportional to the third power of the external electric field) from cryogenic conditions to room temperature in an epitaxially grown material platform with broken time-reversal symmetry. In this paper, using semiclassical Boltzmann formalism in the relaxation time approximation, we compute the Berry curvature quadrupole-induced nonlinear anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst coefficients in time-reversal broken systems. In systems where Berry curvature monopole and dipole moments vanish by symmetry, our results predict the behavior of the leading order anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst coefficients proportional to the third power of the applied longitudinal temperature gradient. They are guaranteed to exist in systems that have already exhibited the third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in recent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor. Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a waveguide circuit QED architecture, we investigate the single-photon pair emission of a Cooper pair splitter composed of two double quantum dots, each coupled to a microwave transmission line. We demonstrate the capability to generate on-demand frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wavepackets at different frequencies. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e., Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate a lower bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of non-radiative processes such as phonon emissions. Our proposal is realistic and achievable with state-of-the-art techniques in quantum microwave engineering with electostatically defined semiconducting quantum dots.</description>

Abstract: The lateral interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) on the h-BN substrate connected by narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges serves as an efficient detector of terahertz (THz) radiation. The detection is enabled by the nonlinear GNR elements providing the rectification of the THz signals. The excitation of plasmonic waves along the GMRs (transverse plasmonic oscillations) by impinging THz radiation can lead to a strong resonant amplification of the rectified signal current and substantial enhancement of the detector response. The GMR arrays with the GNR bridges s can be formed by the perforation of uniform graphene layers</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Strong Coupling and It Induced Time Diffraction of Magnon Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a perturbative approach for studying a class of multi-level time-dependent quantum systems with constant off-diagonal couplings and diabatic energies being odd functions of time. Applying this approach to a general multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing at one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas of all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. For one-crossing MLZ models it is difficult to obtain such analytical results by other kinds of approximation methods; thus, these perturbative results can serve as reliable benchmarks for future studies of any one-crossing MLZ models that have not been exactly solved.</description>

Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to band inversion with a re-opened gap, exhibiting nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Most importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>
