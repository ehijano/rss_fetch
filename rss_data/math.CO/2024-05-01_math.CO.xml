      <title>Maximum spread of $K_{s,t}$-minor-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of a graph $G$ is the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. In this paper, we consider the family of graphs which contain no $K_{s,t}$-minor. We show that for any $t\geq s \geq 2$, there is an integer $\xi_{t}$ such that the extremal $n$-vertex $K_{s,t}$-minor-free graph attaining the maximum spread is the graph obtained by joining a graph $L$ on $(s-1)$ vertices to the disjoint union of $\lfloor \frac{2n+\xi_{t}}{3t}\rfloor$ copies of $K_t$ and $n-s+1 - t\lfloor \frac{2n+\xi_t}{3t}\rfloor$ isolated vertices. Furthermore, we give an explicit formula for $\xi_{t}$ and an explicit description for the graph $L$ for $t \geq \frac32(s-3) +\frac{4}{s-1}$.</description>

      <title>Billiard Partitions, Fibonacci Sequences, SIP Classes, and Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from billiard partitions which arose recently in the description of periodic trajectories of ellipsoidal billiards in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we introduce a new type of separable integer partition classes, called type B. We study the numbers of basis partitions with $d$ parts and relate them to the Fibonacci sequence and its natural generalizations. Remarkably, the generating series of basis partitions can be related to the quiver generating series of symmetric quivers corresponding to the framed unknot via knots-quivers correspondence, and to the count of Schr\"oder paths.</description>

      <title>Avoiding short progressions in Euclidean Ramsey theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general framework to construct colorings avoiding short monochromatic arithmetic progressions in Euclidean Ramsey theory. Specifically, if $\ell_m$ denotes $m$ collinear points with consecutive points of distance one apart, we say that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_r,\ell_s)$ if there is a red/blue coloring of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space that avoids red congruent copies of $\ell_r$ and blue congruent copies of $\ell_s$. We show that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{20})$, improving the best-known result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{1177})$ by F\"uhrer and T\'oth, and also establish $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_4, \ell_{18})$ and $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_5, \ell_{10})$ in the spirit of the classical result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_6, \ell_{6})$ due to Erd{\H{o}}s et. al. We also show a number of similar $3$-coloring results, as well as $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \alpha\ell_{6889})$, where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary positive real number. This final result answers a question of F\"uhrer and T\'oth in the positive.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Divided Difference Operators Satisfying the Braid Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many interesting families of polynomials are indexed by permutations or related objects, and are defined by applying divided difference operators, modified by polynomials, on some initial base case. The fact that these constructions produce well-defined polynomials is based on the applied modified divided difference operators satisfying the braid relations. We thus determine all the families of polynomial divided difference operators that satisfy the braid relations.</description>

      <title>Lower General Position in Cartesian Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is in \emph{general position} if no shortest path in $G$ contains three vertices of $S$. The \emph{general position problem} consists of finding the number of vertices in a largest general position set of $G$, whilst the \emph{lower general position problem} asks for a smallest maximal general position set. In this paper we determine the lower general position numbers of several families of Cartesian products. We also show that the existence of small maximal general position sets in a Cartesian product is connected to a special type of general position set in the factors, which we call a \emph{terminal set}, for which adding any vertex $u$ from outside the set creates three vertices in a line with $u$ as an endpoint. We give a constructive proof of the existence of terminal sets for graphs with diameter at most three. We also present conjectures on the existence of terminal sets for all graphs and a lower bound on the lower general position number of a Cartesian product in terms of the lower general position numbers of its factors.</description>

      <title>On irreducibility of eccentricity matrix of graphs and construction of $\epsilon-$equienergetic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eccentricity matrix $\epsilon(G)$, of a connected graph $G$ is obtained by retaining the maximum distance from each row and column of the distance matrix of $G$ and the other entries are assigned with 0. In this paper, we discuss the eccentricity spectrum of subdivision vertex (edge) join of regular graphs. Also, we obtain new families of graphs having irreducible or reducible eccentricity matrix. Furthermore, we use these results to construct infinitely many $\epsilon-$cospectral graph pairs as well as infinitely many pairs and triplets of $\epsilon-$cospectral $\epsilon-$equienergetic graphs. Moreover, we present some new family of $\epsilon-$integral graphs.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. We present a simple polynomial-time algorithm that finds an LO colouring with $\log_2(n)$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

Abstract: Hindman conjectured that any finite partition of $\mathbb{N}$ has a monochromatic $\{x,y,x+y,xy\}$. Recently, Bowen proved the result for all 2-partition. In this paper, we extend Bowen's result to any semiring $(S,+,\cdot)$ such that $Ss$ is piecewise syndetic for all $s\in S$. As a method, we gave a combinatorial proof for a piecewise syndetic version of Bergerson and Glasscock's IP$_r^*$ Szemer\'edi Theorem, and discussed the case when the operation is not commutative.</description>

      <title>Slice rank and analytic rank for trilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present an elementary proof of the fact that the slice rank of a trilinear form over a finite field is bounded above by a linear expression in the analytic rank. The existing proofs by Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler and Cohen-Moshkovitz both rely on results of Derksen via geometric invariant theory. A novel feature of our proof is that the linear forms appearing in the slice rank decomposition are obtained from the trilinear form by fixing coordinates.</description>

      <title>Roman Domination on Graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of domination, called Roman domination, where we must assign to each vertex one of the labels 0, 1, or 2 and require that every vertex with label 0 has a neighbour with label 2. We study the problem of finding a low-cost Roman dominating function on Lebesgue-measurable graphings, that is, on infinite graphs whose vertices are the points of a probability space. We provide a framework to tackle optimisation problems in the measurable combinatorial setting. In particular, we fully answer the Roman domination problem on irrational cycle graphs, a specific type of graphing on the space $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ where an irrational number ${\alpha}$ is given and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is ${\alpha}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the structure of the Cayley graphs and G-graphs of some gyro-groups are studied and some properties of them will be proved. Moreover we review some special gyro-groups including: gyro-commutative gyrogroups, dihedral gyro-groups and dihedralized gyro-groups. Then we try to establish some important properties of their associated G-graphs. Finally we will examine the symmetry of Cayley graphs and G-graphs of some gyro-groups.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets and an Elementary Bound for the Directed Grid Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer proved the directed grid theorem confirming a conjecture by Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas from the mid-nineties. The theorem states the existence of a function $f$ such that every digraph of directed tree-width $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of order $k$ as a butterfly minor, but the given function grows non-elementarily with the size of the grid minor.
  In this paper we present an alternative proof of the directed grid theorem which is conceptually much simpler, more modular in its composition and also improves the upper bound for the function $f$ to a power tower of height 22.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy, who proved a polynomial bound for the excluded grid theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing \emph{cycles of well-linked sets (CWS)}, and show that any digraph of high directed tree-width contains a large CWS, which in turn contains a large cylindrical grid, improving the result due to Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer from an non-elementary to an elementary function.
  An immediate application of our result is an improvement of the bound for Younger's conjecture proved by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (1996) from a non-elementary to an elementary function. The same improvement applies to other types of Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa style problems on directed graphs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first significant improvement on the bound for Younger's conjecture since it was proved in 1996.
  We believe that the theoretical tools we developed may find applications beyond the directed grid theorem, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy (2016) did (see for example Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge (2022); Chekuri and Chuzhoy (2015); Chuzhoy and Nimavat (2019)).</description>

      <title>Structural Parameters for Dense Temporal Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs provide a useful model for many real-world networks. Unfortunately the majority of algorithmic problems we might consider on such graphs are intractable. There has been recent progress in defining structural parameters which describe tractable cases by simultaneously restricting the underlying structure and the times at which edges appear in the graph. These all rely on the temporal graph being sparse in some sense. We introduce temporal analogues of three increasingly restrictive static graph parameters -- cliquewidth, modular-width and neighbourhood diversity -- which take small values for highly structured temporal graphs, even if a large number of edges are active at each timestep. The computational problems solvable efficiently when the temporal cliquewidth of the input graph is bounded form a subset of those solvable efficiently when the temporal modular-width is bounded, which is in turn a subset of problems efficiently solvable when the temporal neighbourhood diversity is bounded. By considering specific temporal graph problems, we demonstrate that (up to standard complexity theoretic assumptions) these inclusions are strict.</description>

      <title>Reachability in temporal graphs under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachability and other path-based measures on temporal graphs can be used to understand spread of infection, information, and people in modelled systems. Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidences have suggested that counting representations are sometimes tractable even when the corresponding classification problem is almost impossible, or "wild" in a precise sense. Such counting problems are directly related to matrix counting problems, many of which are under active research. Using a general framework we formulate for such counting problems, we reduce some counting problems about commuting matries to problems about endomorphisms on all finite abelian $p$-groups. As an application, we count finite modules on some first examples of nonreduced curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also relate some classical and hard problems regarding commuting triples of matrices to a conjecture of Onn on counting conjugacy classes of the automorphism group of an arbitrary finite abelian $p$-group.</description>

Abstract: In Catalan percolation, all nearest-neighbor edges $\{i,i+1\}$ along $\mathbb Z$ are initially occupied, and all other edges are open independently with probability $p$. Open edges $\{i,j\}$ are occupied if some pair of edges $\{i,k\}$ and $\{k,j\}$, with $i&lt;k&lt;j$, become occupied. This model was introduced by Gravner and the third author, in the context of polluted graph bootstrap percolation.
  We prove that the critical $p_{\mathrm c}$ is strictly between that of oriented site percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ and the Catalan growth rate $1/4$. Our main result shows that an enhanced oriented percolation model, with non-decaying infinite-range dependency, has a strictly smaller critical parameter than the classical model. This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hil\'ario, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities. Two key ingredients are the work of Hil\'ario, S\'a, Sanchis and Teixeira on stretched lattices, and the Russo--Seymour--Welsh result for oriented percolation by Duminil-Copin, Tassion and Teixeira.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for tensor products of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for tensor product random variables $c_k:=a_k \otimes a_k$, where $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a free family of variables. We show that if the variables $a_k$ are centered, the limiting law is the semi-circle. Otherwise, the limiting law depends on the mean and variance of the variables $a_k$ and corresponds to a free interpolation between the semi-circle law and the classical convolution of two semi-circle laws.</description>

Abstract: Let $H$ be an HD0L-system. We show that there are only finitely many primitive words $v$ with the property that $v^k$, for all integers $k$, is an element of the factorial language of $H$. In particular, this result applies to the set of all factors of a morphic word. We provide a formalized proof in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL as part of the Combinatorics on Words Formalized project.</description>

      <title>Essential $\mathcal{F}$-sets of $\mathbb{N}$ under nonhomogeneous spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. Define $g_{\alpha,\gamma}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ by $g_{\alpha,\gamma}\left(n\right)=\lfloor\alpha n+\gamma\rfloor$. The set $\left\{ g_{\alpha,\gamma}\left(n\right):n\in\mathbb{N}\right\} $ is called the nonhomogeneous spectrum of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. We refer to the maps $g_{\alpha,\gamma}$ as nonhomogeneous spectra. In \cite{BHK}, Bergelson, Hindman and Kra showed that if $A$ is an $IP$-set, a central set, an $IP^{\star}$-set, or a central$^{\star}$-set, then $g_{\alpha,\gamma}\left[A\right]$ is the corresponding objects. Hindman and Johnsons extended this result to include several other notions of largeness: $C$-sets, $J$-sets, strongly central sets, piecwise syndetic sets, $AP$-sets syndetic set, $C^{\star}$-sets, strongly central$^{\star}$- sets . In \cite{DHS}, De, Hindman and Strauss introduced $C$-set and $J$-set and showed that $C$-sets satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem. To prepare this article, we have been strongly motivated by the fact that $C$-sets are essential $\mathcal{J}$-sets. In this article, we prove some new results regarding nonhomogeneous spectra of essential $\mathcal{F}$-sets for shift invariant $\mathcal{F}$-sets. We have a special interest in the family $\mathcal{HSD}=\left\{ A\subseteq\mathbb{N}:\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}=\infty\right\} $ as this family is directly connected with the famous Erd\H{o}s sum of reciprocal conjecture and as a consequence we get $g_{\alpha,\gamma}\left[\mathbb{P}\right]\in\mathcal{HSD}$, where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$. Throughout this article, we use some elementary techniques and algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of discrete semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a generating function trick which allows us to keep track of infinitely many statistics using finitely many variables, by recording their individual distributions rather than their joint distributions. Building on previous work of Panholzer and Prodinger, we apply this method to study the depth distributions of individual nodes in rooted binary trees, plane trees, noncrossing trees, and increasing trees; the height distributions of individual vertices and individual steps in Dyck paths; and the number of diagonals separating two fixed sides of a convex polygon in a triangulation or dissection. We obtain both exact and asymptotic results, which sometimes refine known formulas or provide combinatorial proofs of results from the probability literature.</description>

      <title>Classification of lattice triangles by their two smallest widths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the second lattice width of a lattice polytope and use this to classify lattice triangles by their width and second width. This is equivalent to classifying lattice triangles contained in a given rectangle (and no smaller rectangle) up to affine equivalence. Using this classification we investigate the automorphism groups and Ehrhart theory of lattice triangles. We also show that the sequence counting lattice triangles contained in dilations of the unit square has generating function equal to the Hilbert series of a degree 8 hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,2,2,2)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field. Suppose that $\mathscr{F}_1$, $\mathscr{F}_2$, $\dots$, $\mathscr{F}_r$ are $r$-cross $t$-intersecting families of $k$-subspaces of $V$. In this paper, we determine the extremal structure when $\prod_{i=1}^r|\mathscr{F}_i|$ is maximum under the condition that $\dim(\bigcap_{F\in\mathscr{F}_i}F)&lt;t$ for each $i$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce coloring groups, which are permutation groups obtained from a proper edge coloring of a graph. These groups generalize the generalized toggle groups of Striker (which themselves generalize the toggle groups introduced by Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass). We present some general results connecting the structure of a coloring group to the structure of its graph coloring, providing graph-theoretic characterizations of the centralizer and primitivity of a coloring group. We apply these results particularly to generalized toggle groups arising from trees as well as coloring groups arising from the independence posets introduced by Thomas and Williams.</description>

      <title>Constructing cospectral graphs by unfolding non-bipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Butler introduced the unfolding operation on a bipartite graph to produce two bipartite graphs, which are cospectral for the adjacency and the normalized Laplacian matrices. In this article, we describe how the idea of unfolding a bipartite graph with respect to another bipartite graph can be extended to nonbipartite graphs. In particular, we describe how unfoldings involving reflexive bipartite, semi-reflexive bipartite, and multipartite graphs are used to obtain cospectral nonisomorphic graphs for the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}$-intersecting or Configuration Forbidden Families on Set Systems and Vector Spaces over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a tight upper bound for the size of an intersecting $k$-Sperner family of subspaces of the $n$-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ over finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ which gives a $q$-analogue of the Erd\H{o}s' $k$-Sperner Theorem, and we then establish a general relationship between upper bounds for the sizes of families of subsets of $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ with property $P$ and upper bounds for the sizes of families of subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ with property $P$, where $P$ is either $\mathcal{L}$-intersecting or forbidding certain configuration. Applying this relationship, we derive generalizations of the well known results about the famous Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture and Erd\H{o}s-Chv\'atal simplex conjecture to linear lattices. As a consequence, we disprove a related conjecture on families of subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ by Ihringer [Europ. J. Combin., 94 (2021), 103306].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of examples of bounded degree acyclic Borel graphs and study their combinatorial properties in the context of descriptive combinatorics, using a generalization of the determinacy method of Marks. The motivation for the construction comes from the adaptation of this method to the LOCAL model of distributed computing. Our approach unifies the previous results in the area, as well as produces new ones. In particular, we show that for $\Delta&gt;2$ it is impossible to give a simple characterization of acyclic $\Delta$-regular Borel graphs with Borel chromatic number at most $\Delta$: such graphs form a $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete set. This implies a strong failure of Brooks'-like theorems in the Borel context.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Greedy $B_h$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $A$ of nonnegative integers is called a $B_h$-set if every solution to $a_1+\dots+a_h = b_1+\dots+b_h$, where $a_i,b_i \in A$, has $\{a_1,\dots,a_h\}=\{b_1,\dots,b_h\}$ (as multisets). Let $\gamma_k(h)$ be the $k$-th positive element of the greedy $B_h$-set. We give a nontrivial lower bound on $\gamma_5(h)$, and a nontrivial upper bound on $\gamma_k(h)$ for $k\ge 5$. Specifically, $\frac 18 h^4 +\frac12 h^3 \le \gamma_5(h) \le 0.467214 h^4+O(h^3)$, although we conjecture that $\gamma_5(h)=\frac13 h^4 +O(h^3)$. We show that $\gamma_k(h) \ge \frac{1}{k!} h^{k-1} + O(h^{k-2})$ for $k\ge 1$ and $\gamma_k(h) \le \alpha_k h^{k-1}+O(h^{k-2})$, where $\alpha_6 := 0.382978$, $\alpha_7 := 0.269877$, and for $k\ge 7$, $\alpha_{k+1} := \frac{1}{2^k k!} \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \binom{k-1}j\binom kj 2^j$. This work begins with a thorough introduction and concludes with a section of open problems.</description>
