      <title>Berwald $m$-Kropina Spaces of Arbitrary Signature: Metrizability and Ricci-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (pseudo-)Riemann-metrizability and Ricci-flatness of Finsler spaces with $m$-Kropina metric $F = \alpha^{1+m}\beta^{-m}$ of Berwald type are investigated. We prove that the affine connection on $F$ can locally be understood as the Levi-Civita connection of some (pseudo-)Riemannian metric if and only if the Ricci tensor of the canonical affine connection is symmetric. We also obtain a third equivalent characterization in terms of the covariant derivative of the 1-form $\beta$. We use these results to classify all locally metrizable $m$-Kropina spaces whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In the special case where the first de Rahm cohomology group of the underlying manifold is trivial (which is true of simply connected manifolds, for instance), we show that global metrizability is equivalent to local metrizability and hence, in that case, our necessary and sufficient conditions also characterize global metrizability. In addition, we further obtain explicitly all Ricci-flat, locally metrizable $m$-Kropina metrics in $(3+1)$D whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In fact, the only possibilities are essentially the following two: either $\alpha$ is flat and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel, or $\alpha$ is a pp-wave and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel.</description>

      <title>On Relative Cohomology in Lie Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by our attempt to understand characteristic classes of Lie groupoids and geometric structures, we are brought back to the fundamentals of the cohomology theories of Lie groupoids and algebroids. One element that was missing in the literature was the notion of relative cohomology in this setting. The main aim of this paper is to develop the structural theory of this notion, the relation between the relative cohomology of groupoids and that of algebroids via van Est maps, and to indicate how it can be used to provide an intrinsic definition of characteristic classes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative tightness for three-dimensional contact manifolds: a sub-Riemannian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the use of sub-Riemannian metrics we provide quantitative estimates for the maximal tight neighbourhood of a Reeb orbit on a three-dimensional contact manifold. Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to construct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce the concept of contact Jacobi curve, and prove sharp lower bounds of the so-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian derivative bounds. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, comparison theorems in terms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact analogue of the celebrated Cartan-Hadamard theorem.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold, which separates its holomorphic moduli from the space of compatible metrics in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds, which involves the new concept of a holomorphic symplectic Morita 2-equivalence between double symplectic groupoids, equipped with a Lagrangian bisection of its real symplectic core. Essentially, any generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the metric is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold of its fixed point locus. This finally resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita 2-equivalence and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with decorated boundary, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By variational methods, we prove existence of planar closed curves with prescribed curvature for some classes of curvature functions. The main difficulty is to obtain bounded Palais-Smale sequences. This is achieved by adding a parameter in the problem and using a version of the "monotonicity trick" introduced by M. Struwe in 1988.</description>

      <title>Degenerating conic K\"ahler-Einstein metrics to the normal cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Fano manifold of dimension at least $2$ and $D$ be a smooth divisor in a multiple of the anticanonical class, $\frac1\alpha(-K_X)$ with $\alpha&gt;1$. It is well-known that K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on $X$ with conic singularities along $D$ may exist only if the angle $2\pi\beta$ is bigger than some positive limit value $2\pi\beta_*$. Under the hypothesis that the automorphisms of $D$ are induced by the automorphisms of the pair $(X,D)$, we prove that for $\beta&gt;\beta_*$ close enough to $\beta_*$, such K\"ahler-Einstein metrics do exist. We identify the limits at various scales when $\beta\rightarrow\beta_*$ and, in particular, we exhibit the appearance of the Tian-Yau metric of $X\setminus D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider smooth vector bundles over smooth manifolds equipped with non-smooth geometric data. For nilpotent differential operators acting on these bundles, we show that the kernels of induced Hodge-Dirac-type operators remain isomorphic under uniform perturbations of the geometric data. We consider applications of this to the Hodge-Dirac operator on differential forms induced by so-called rough Riemannian metrics, which can be of only measurable coefficient in regularity, on both compact and non-compact settings. As a consequence, we show that the kernel of the associated non-smooth Hodge-Dirac operator with respect to a rough Riemannian metric remains isomorphic to smooth and singular cohomology when the underlying manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>Self-shrinkers whose asymptotic cones fatten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each positive integer $g$ we use variational methods to construct a genus $g$ self-shrinker $\Sigma_g$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with entropy less than $2$ and prismatic symmetry group $\mathbb{D}_{g+1}\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. For $g$ sufficiently large, the self-shrinker $\Sigma_g$ has two graphical asymptotically conical ends and the sequence $\Sigma_g$ converges on compact subsets to a plane with multiplicity two as $g\to\infty$. Angenent-Chopp-Ilmanen conjectured the existence of such self-shrinkers in 1995 based on numerical experiments. Using these surfaces as initial conditions for large $g$, we obtain examples of mean curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth initial non-compact data that evolve non-uniquely after their first singular time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, combining the Rashevsky-Chow-Sussmann (orbit) theorem with the Ambrose-Singer theorem, we introduce the notion of controllable principal connections on principal $G$-bundles. Using this concept, under a mild assumption of compactness, we estimate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between principal $G$-bundles and certain reductive homogeneous $G$-spaces. In addition, we prove that every reduction of the structure group $G$ to a closed connected subgroup gives rise to a sequence of Riemannian metrics on the total space for which the underlying sequence of metric spaces converges, in the Gromov-Housdorff topology, to a normal reductive homogeneous $G$-space. This last finding allows one to detect the presence of certain reductive homogeneous $G$-spaces in the Gromov-Housdorff closure of the moduli space of Riemannian metrics of the total space of the bundle through topological invariants provided by obstruction theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

Abstract: We construct projective asymptotically good moduli spaces parametrizing boundary polarized CY surface pairs, which are projective slc Calabi-Yau pairs $(X,D)$ such that $D$ is ample and $X$ has dimension two. The moduli space provides a wall crossing between certain KSBA and K-moduli spaces and is the ample model of the Hodge line bundle. In the case of K3 surfaces with a non-symplectic automorphism, the moduli space gives a modular interpretation for the Baily--Borel compactification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the strong relationship between Myrberg type dynamics and the ergodic properties of the geodesic flows on (not necessarily compact) uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points. We prove that the positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is equivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is a full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set.</description>

      <title>A relative mass cocycle and the mass of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a cocycle that, for a given $n$-manifold, maps pairs of asymptotically locally hyperbolic (ALH) metrics to a tractor-valued $(n-1)$-form field on the conformal infinity. This requires the metrics to be asymptotically related to a given order that depends on the dimension. It then provides a local geometric quantity on the boundary that is naturally associated to the pair and can be interpreted as a relative energy-momentum density. It is distinguished as a geometric object by its property of being invariant under suitable diffeomorphisms fixing the boundary, and that act on (either) one of the argument metrics. Specialising to the case of an ALH metric $h$ that is suitably asymptotically related to a locally hyperbolic conformally compact metric, we show that the cocycle determines an absolute invariant $c(h)$, which still is local in nature. This tractor-valued $(n-1)$-form field on the conformal infinity is canonically associated to $h$ (i.e. is not dependent on other choices) and is equivariant under the appropriate diffeomorphisms. Finally specialising further to the case that the boundary is a sphere and that a metric $h$ is asymptotically related to a hyperbolic metric on the interior, we show that the invariant $c(h)$ can be integrated over the boundary. The result pairs with solutions of the KID (Killing initial data) equation to recover the known description of hyperbolic mass integrals of Wang, and Chru\'{s}ciel--Herzlich.</description>

Abstract: We study complete minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with finite total curvature and embedded planar ends. After conformal compactification via inversion, these yield examples of surfaces stationary for the Willmore bending energy $\mathcal{W}: =\frac{1}{4} \int|\vec H|^2$. In codimension one, we prove that the $\mathcal{W}$-Morse index for any inverted minimal sphere or real projective plane with $m$ such ends is exactly $m-3=\frac{\mathcal{W}}{4\pi}-3$. We also consider several geometric properties -- for example, the property that all $m$ asymptotic planes meet at a single point -- of these minimal surfaces and explore their relation to the $\mathcal{W}$-Morse index of their inverted surfaces.</description>

In this note, we give a new proof based on inverse mean curvature flow that $(M,g)$ is either flat or has non-Euclidean volume growth. In conjunction with results of J. Lott and of M.-C. Lee and P. Topping, this gives an alternative proof of a conjecture of R. Hamilton recently proven by A. Deruelle, F. Schulze, and M. Simon using Ricci flow.</description>

Abstract: Given a branched Willmore immersion from a closed Riemann surface, we show that Bryant's quartic is holomorphic. Consequently, this quartic vanishes when the underlying surface is a sphere and we obtain the full classification of branched Willmore spheres. To do so, we show that the asymptotic expansion in the $C^2$-topology of the conformal Gauss map at a branched point is a null straight line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define \emph{$0$-shifted} and \emph{$+1$-shifted contact structures} on differentiable stacks, thus laying the foundations of \emph{shifted Contact Geometry}. As a side result we show that the kernel of a multiplicative $1$-form on a Lie groupoid (might not exist as a Lie groupoid but it) always exists as a differentiable stack, and it is naturally equipped with a stacky version of the curvature of a distribution. Contact structures on orbifolds provide examples of $0$-shifted contact structures, while prequantum bundles over $+1$-shifted symplectic groupoids provide examples of $+1$-shifted contact structures. Our shifted contact structures are related to shifted symplectic structures via a Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary.</description>

      <title>New examples of Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and their deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect a number of elementary constructions of $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms, and of families of these objects. These examples show that the branching set $\Sigma$ of a $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic 1-form may exhibit the following features: i) $\Sigma$ may be a non-trivial link; ii) $\Sigma$ may be a multiple cover; iii) $\Sigma$ may be immersed, and appear as a limit of smoothly embedded branching loci; iv) there are families of $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms whose branching sets $\Sigma$ have tangent cones filling out a positive dimensional space, even modulo isometries.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives sufficient conditions for the existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics on double disk bundles of two summands type. These conditions are inequalities that only involve geometric data from the principal orbits. The existence theorem yields five infinite families and ten other sporadic examples of new inhomogeneous Einstein metrics. The non-existence theorem yields five examples whose principal orbits admit invariant Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>CMC surfaces of revolution, Elliptic curves, Weierstrass-$\wp$ functions, and Algebraicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an interesting connection between the family of CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E_1^3$ and some specific families of elliptic curves. As a consequence of this connection, we show in the class of spacelike CMC surfaces of revolution in the $\mathbb E_1^3$, only spacelike cylinders and standard hyperboloids are algebraic. We also show that a similar connection exists between CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ and elliptic curves. Further, we use this to reestablish the fact that the only CMC algebraic surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ are spheres and right circular cylinders.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Generalised Spin$^r$ Spinors on Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt the characterisation of the spin representation via exterior forms to the generalised spin$^r$ context. We find new invariant spin$^r$ spinors on the projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^n$, $\mathbb{HP}^n$, and the Cayley plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$ for all their homogeneous realisations. Specifically, for each of these realisations, we provide a complete description of the space of invariant spin$^r$ for the minimum value of $r$ for which this space is non-zero. Additionally, we demonstrate some geometric implications of the existence of special spin$^r$ spinors on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal volume bound and volume growth for Ricci-nonnegative manifolds with positive Bi-Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the optimal volume growth for complete Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g)$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature everywhere and bi-Ricci curvature bounded from below by $n-2$ outside a compact set when the dimension is less than eight. This answers a question [AX24, Question 1] proposed by Antonelli-Xu in dimensions six and seven. As a by-product, we also prove an analogy of Gromov's volume bound conjecture [Gro86, Open Question 2.A.(b)] under the condition of positive bi-Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On certain Navier-Stokes flows on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies bounded conditions on curvature tensors. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.</description>
