      <title>Sample Complexity of Identifying the Nonredundancy of Nontransitive Games in Dueling Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dueling bandit is a variant of the Multi-armed bandit to learn the binary relation by comparisons. Most work on the dueling bandit has targeted transitive relations, that is, totally/partially ordered sets, or assumed at least the existence of a champion such as Condorcet winner and Copeland winner. This work develops an analysis of dueling bandits for non-transitive relations. Jan-ken (a.k.a. rock-paper-scissors) is a typical example of a non-transitive relation. It is known that a rational player chooses one of three items uniformly at random, which is known to be Nash equilibrium in game theory. Interestingly, any variant of Jan-ken with four items (e.g., rock, paper, scissors, and well) contains at least one useless item, which is never selected by a rational player. This work investigates a dueling bandit problem to identify whether all $n$ items are indispensable in a given win-lose relation. Then, we provide upper and lower bounds of the sample complexity of the identification problem in terms of the determinant of $A$ and a solution of $\mathbf{x}^{\top} A = \mathbf{0}^{\top}$ where $A$ is an $n \times n$ pay-off matrix that every duel follows.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Aware Machine Learning; Robustness, Fairness, Improvement &amp; Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article explores the emerging domain of incentive-aware machine learning (ML), which focuses on algorithmic decision-making in contexts where individuals can strategically modify their inputs to influence outcomes. It categorizes the research into three perspectives: robustness, aiming to design models resilient to "gaming"; fairness, analyzing the societal impacts of such systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including offline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and causally-informed incentive-aware ML systems.</description>

      <title>Weighted Envy-Freeness Revisited: Indivisible Resource and House Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envy-Freeness is one of the most fundamental and important concepts in fair allocation. Some recent studies have focused on the concept of weighted envy-freeness. Under this concept, each agent is assigned a weight, and their valuations are divided by their weights when assessing fairness. This concept can promote more fairness in some scenarios. But on the other hand, experimental research has shown that this weighted envy-freeness significantly reduces the likelihood of fair allocations. When we must allocate the resources, we may propose fairness concepts with lower requirements that are potentially more feasible to implement. In this paper, we revisit weighted envy-freeness and propose a new concept called SumAvg-envy-freeness, which substantially increases the existence of fair allocations. This new concept can be seen as a complement of the normal weighted envy-fairness. Furthermore, we systematically study the computational complexity of finding fair allocations under the old and new weighted fairness concepts in two types of classic problems: Indivisible Resource Allocation and House Allocation. Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of various properties of weighted envy-freeness.</description>

      <title>SUUM: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two advanced attack strategies, the Unrestricted Uncle Maker (UUM) Attack and the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM) Attack, which fundamentally threaten the security of timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchains by inflicting permanent systemic harm. Unlike prior work that merely enhances adversarial rewards, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in timestamp manipulation and fork selection rules to irreversibly destabilize blockchain fairness and incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the SUUM attack enables adversaries to persistently launch attacks at zero cost, eliminating constraints on block withholding and risk-free conditions, while systematically maximizing rewards through coordinated timestamp adjustments and strategic block release.
  Our analysis demonstrates that SUUM adversaries achieve disproportionate reward advantages over both UUM and the original Riskless Uncle Maker (RUM) Attack [CCS '23], with all three strategies surpassing honest mining. Crucially, SUUM's cost-free persistence allows adversaries to indefinitely drain rewards from honest participants by maintaining minimal difficulty risks through precise timestamp manipulation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: adversaries amplify their profits while suppressing honest returns, thereby permanently eroding the protocol's security assumptions. Through rigorous theoretical modeling and simulations, we validate how SUUM's combination of timestamp tampering, block withholding, and difficulty risk control enables unmitigated exploitation of consensus mechanisms. This work underscores the existential risks posed by timestamp-based Nakamoto-style protocols and advocates urgent countermeasures to ensure long-term stability.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Learning with Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of online learning algorithms when learners possess private information. No-external-regret algorithms, prevalent in machine learning, are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, allowing an adaptive opponent to extract full surplus. Even standard no-weak-external-regret algorithms, designed for optimal learning in stationary environments, exhibit similar vulnerabilities. This raises a fundamental question: can a learner simultaneously prevent full surplus extraction by adaptive opponents while maintaining optimal performance in well-behaved environments? To address this, we model the problem as a two-player repeated game, where the learner with private information plays against the environment, facing ambiguity about the environment's types: stationary or adaptive. We introduce \emph{partial safety} as a key design criterion for online learning algorithms to prevent full surplus extraction. We then propose the \emph{Explore-Exploit-Punish} (\textsf{EEP}) algorithm and prove that it satisfies partial safety while achieving optimal learning in stationary environments, and has a variant that delivers improved welfare performance. Our findings highlight the risks of applying standard online learning algorithms in strategic settings with adverse selection. We advocate for a shift toward online learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate safeguards against strategic manipulation while ensuring strong learning performance.</description>

      <title>Parallel Contests for Crowdsourcing Reviews: Existence and Quality of Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the intricacies of allocating treasury funds in blockchain settings, we study the problem of crowdsourcing reviews for many different proposals, in parallel. During the reviewing phase, every reviewer can select the proposals to write reviews for, as well as the quality of each review. The quality levels follow certain very coarse community guidelines and can have values such as 'excellent' or 'good'. Based on these scores and the distribution of reviews, every reviewer will receive some reward for their efforts. In this paper, we design a reward scheme and show that it always has pure Nash equilibria, for any set of proposals and reviewers. In addition, we show that these equilibria guarantee constant factor approximations for two natural metrics: the total quality of all reviews, as well as the fraction of proposals that received at least one review, compared to the optimal outcome.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Expressive Delegations: Complexity and Normative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider binary group decision-making under a rich model of liquid democracy recently proposed by Colley, Grandi, and Novaro (2022): agents submit ranked delegation options, where each option may be a function of multiple agents' votes; e.g., "I vote yes if a majority of my friends vote yes." Such ballots are unravelled into a profile of direct votes by selecting one entry from each ballot so as not to introduce cyclic dependencies. We study delegation via monotonic Boolean functions, and two unravelling procedures: MinSum, which minimises the sum of the ranks of the chosen entries, and its egalitarian counterpart, MinMax. We provide complete computational dichotomies: MinSum is hard to compute (and approximate) as soon as any non-trivial functions are permitted, and polynomial otherwise; for MinMax the easiness results extend to arbitrary-arity logical ORs and ANDs taken in isolation, but not beyond. For the classic model of delegating to individual agents, we give asymptotically near-tight algorithms for carrying out the two procedures and efficient algorithms for finding optimal unravellings with the highest vote count for a given alternative. These algorithms inspire novel tie-breaking rules for the setup of voting to change a status quo. We then introduce a new axiom, which can be viewed as a variant of the participation axiom, and use algorithmic techniques developed earlier in the paper to show that it is satisfied by MinSum and a lexicographic refinement of MinMax (but not MinMax itself).</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</description>
