      <title>Foundations of locally-balanced Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formally introduce and study locally-balanced Markov jump processes (LBMJPs) defined on a general state space. These continuous-time stochastic processes with a user-specified limiting distribution are designed for sampling in settings involving discrete parameters and/or non-smooth distributions, addressing limitations of other processes such as the overdamped Langevin diffusion. The paper establishes the well-posedness, non-explosivity, and ergodicity of LBMJPs under mild conditions. We further explore regularity properties such as the Feller property and characterise the weak generator of the process. We then derive conditions for exponential ergodicity via spectral gaps and establish comparison theorems for different balancing functions. In particular we show an equivalence between the spectral gaps of Metropolis--Hastings algorithms and LBMJPs with bounded balancing function, but show that LBMJPs can exhibit uniform ergodicity on unbounded state spaces when the balancing function is unbounded, even when the limiting distribution is not sub-Gaussian. We also establish a diffusion limit for an LBMJP in the small jump limit, and discuss applications to Monte Carlo sampling and non-reversible extensions of the processes.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation on moving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong($H^1$) well-posedness of the two dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with multiplicative noise on moving domains. Due to the nonlocality effect, this equation exhibits a ``piecewise" variational setting. Namely the global well-posedness of this equation is decomposed into the well-posedness of a family of stochastic partial differential equations(SPDEs) in the variational setting on each small time-interval. We first examine the well-posedness on each time interval, which does not have (nonhomogeneous) coercivity. Subsequently, we give an estimate of lower bound of length of the time-interval, which enables us to achieve the global well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time filtering in Lie groups: estimation via the Fr{\'e}chet mean of solutions to stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Fr\'echet mean $\mathscr{E}_t$ of the solution $X_{t}$ to a continuous-time stochastic differential equation in a Lie group. It provides an estimator with minimal variance of $X_{t}$. We use it in the context of Kalman filtering and more precisely to infer rotation matrices. In this paper, we focus on the prediction step between two consecutive observations. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our assumptions on the model are minimal.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap for the Stochastic Exchange Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a spectral gap inequality for the stochastic exchange model studied by Gaspard and Gilbert and by Grigo, Khanin and Sz\'asz in connection with understanding heat conduction in a deterministic billiards model. The bound on the spectral gap that we prove is uniform in the number of particles, as had been conjectured. We adapt techniques that were originally developed to prove spectral gap bounds for the Kac model with hard sphere collisions, which, like the stochastic exchange model, has degenerate jump rates.</description>

      <title>Set-valued conditional functionals of random sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many key quantities in statistics and probability theory such as the expectation, quantiles, expectiles and many risk measures are law-determined maps from a space of random variables to the reals. We call such a law-determined map, which is normalised, positively homogeneous, monotone and translation equivariant, a gauge function. Considered as a functional on the space of distributions, we can apply such a gauge to the conditional distribution of a random variable. This results in conditional gauges, such as conditional quantiles or conditional expectations. In this paper, we apply such scalar gauges to the support function of a random closed convex set $\bX$. This leads to a set-valued extension of a gauge function. We also introduce a conditional variant whose values are themselves random closed convex sets. In special cases, this functional becomes the conditional set-valued quantile or the conditional set-valued expectation of a random set. In particular, in the unconditional setup, if $\bX$ is a random translation of a deterministic cone and the gauge is either a quantile or an expectile, we recover the cone distribution functions studied by Andreas Hamel and his co-authors. In the conditional setup, the conditional quantile of a random singleton yields the conditional version of the half-space depth-trimmed regions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and computational investigations of superposed interacting affine and more complex processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian long memory processes arise from numerous science and engineering problems. The Markovian lift is an effective mathematical technique that transforms a non-Markov process into an infinite-dimensional Markov process to which a broad range of theoretical and computational results can be potentially applied. One challenge in Markovian lifts is that the resulting Markovian system has multiple time scales ranging from infinitely small to infinitely large; therefore, a numerical method that consistently deals with them is required. However, such an approach has not been well studied for the superposition of affine or more complex jump-diffusion processes driven by L\'evy bases. We address this issue based on recently developed exact discretization methods for affine diffusion and jump processes. A nominal superposition process consisting of an infinite number of interacting affine processes was considered, along with its finite-dimensional version and associated generalized Riccati equations. We examine the computational performance of the proposed numerical scheme based on exact discretization methods through comparisons with the analytical results. We also numerically investigate a more complex model arising in the environmental sciences and some extended cases in which superposed processes belong to a class of nonlinear processes that generalize affine processes.</description>

      <title>Limiting spectral laws for sparse random circulant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a positive integer $d$ and let $(G_n)_{n\geq1}$ be a sequence of finite abelian groups with orders tending to infinity. For each $n \geq 1$, let $C_n$ be a uniformly random $G_n$-circulant matrix with entries in $\{0,1\}$ and exactly $d$ ones in each row/column. We show that the empirical spectral distribution of $C_n$ converges weakly in expectation to a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{C}$ if and only if the distribution of the order of a uniform random element of $G_n$ converges weakly to a probability measure $\rho$ on $\mathbb{N}^*$, the one-point compactification of the natural numbers. Furthermore, we show that convergence in expectation can be strengthened to convergence in probability if and only if $\rho$ is a Dirac mass $\delta_m$. In this case, $\mu$ is the $d$-fold convolution of the uniform distribution on the $m$-th roots of unity if $m\in\mathbb{N}$ or the unit circle if $m = \infty$. We also establish that, under further natural assumptions, the determinant of $C_n$ is $\pm\exp((c_{m,d}+o(1))|G_n|)$ with high probability, where $c_{m,d}$ is a constant depending only on $m$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models for Decision-Making: Integrating Causality and Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However, practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Use of Topological Data Analysis for the Detection of Phenomenological Bifurcations in Stochastic Epidemiological Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate predictions of stochastic compartmental models on the severity of disease outbreaks. The models we consider are the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) for bacterial infections, and the Susceptible -Infected-Removed (SIR) for airborne diseases. Stochasticity enters the compartmental models as random fluctuations of the contact rate, to account for uncertainties in the disease spread. We consider three types of noise to model the random fluctuations: the Gaussian white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises, and the logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (logOU). The advantages of logOU noise are its positivity and its ability to model the presence of superspreaders. We utilize homological bifurcation plots from Topological Data Analysis to automatically determine the shape of the long-time distributions of the number of infected for the SIS, and removed for the SIR model, over a range of basic reproduction numbers and relative noise intensities. LogOU noise results in distributions that stay close to the endemic deterministic equilibrium even for high noise intensities. For low reproduction rates and increasing intensity, the distribution peak shifts towards zero, that is, disease eradication, for all three noises; for logOU noise the shift is the slowest. Our study underlines the sensitivity of model predictions to the type of noise considered in contact rate.</description>

      <title>Stability of Polling Systems for a Large Class of Markovian Switching Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a polling system with two queues, where a single server is attending the queues in a cyclic order and requires non-zero switching times to switch between the queues. Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of `robust' polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fractional Information: Consistency of Dissipation Measures for Stable Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric alpha-stable (S alpha S) distributions with alpha&lt;2 lack finite classical Fisher information. Building on Johnson's framework, we define Mixed Fractional Information (MFI) via the initial rate of relative entropy dissipation during interpolation between S alpha S laws with differing scales, v and s. We demonstrate two equivalent formulations for MFI in this specific S alpha S-to-S alpha S setting. The first involves the derivative D'(v) of the relative entropy between the two S alpha S densities. The second uses an integral expectation E_gv[u(x,0) (pF_v(x) - pF_s(x))] involving the difference between Fisher scores (pF_v, pF_s) and a specific MMSE-related score function u(x,0) derived from the interpolation dynamics. Our central contribution is a rigorous proof of the consistency identity: D'(v) = (1/(alpha v)) E_gv[X (pF_v(X) - pF_s(X))]. This identity mathematically validates the equivalence of the two MFI formulations for S alpha S inputs, establishing MFI's internal coherence and directly linking entropy dissipation rates to score function differences. We further establish MFI's non-negativity (zero if and only if v=s), derive its closed-form expression for the Cauchy case (alpha=1), and numerically validate the consistency identity. MFI provides a finite, coherent, and computable information-theoretic measure for comparing S alpha S distributions where classical Fisher information fails, connecting entropy dynamics to score functions and estimation concepts. This work lays a foundation for exploring potential fractional I-MMSE relations and new functional inequalities tailored to heavy-tailed systems.</description>

      <title>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic searchers as a key example uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The non-linear multiple stopping problem: between the discrete and the continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the non-linear optimal multiple stopping problem under general conditions on the non-linear evaluation operators, which might depend on two time indices: the time of evaluation/assessment and the horizon (when the reward or loss is incurred). We do not assume convexity/concavity or cash-invariance. We focus on the case where the agent's stopping strategies are what we call Bermudan stopping strategies, a framework which can be seen as lying between the discrete and the continuous time. We first study the non-linear double optimal stopping problem by using a reduction approach. We provide a necessary and a sufficient condition for optimal pairs, and a result on existence of optimal pairs. We then generalize the results to the non-linear $d$-optimal stopping problem. We treat the symmetric case (of additive and multiplicative reward families) as examples.</description>

      <title>On a stochastic epidemic SIR model with non homogenous population: a toy model for HIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we generalise a simple discrete time stochastic SIR type model defined by Tuckwell and Williams. The SIR model by Tuckwell and Williams assumes a homogeneous population, a fixed infectious period, and a strict transition from susceptible to infected to recovered. In contrast, our model introduces two groups, $A$ and $B$, where group $B$ has a higher risk of infection due to increased contact rates. Additionally, the duration in the infected class follows a probability distribution rather than being fixed. Finally, individuals in group $B$ can transition directly to the recovered class R, allowing us to analyze the impact of this preventive measure on disease spread. Finally, we apply this model to the spread of HIV, analyzing how risk behaviors, rapid testing, and PrEP-like therapies influence the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>One-side Liouville Theorem for hypoelliptic Ornstein--Uhlenbeck operators having drifts with imaginary spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Liouville theorem for \emph{non-negative} solutions to (possibly degenerate) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations whose linear drift has imaginary spectrum. This provides an answer to a question raised by Priola and Zabczyk since the proof of their Theorem characterizing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators having the Liouville property for \emph{bounded} solutions. Our approach is based on a Liouville property at ``$t=-\infty$" for the solutions to the relevant Kolmogorov equation which, in turn, derives from a new parabolic Harnack-type inequality for its non-negative ancient solutions.</description>

      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Extremal behavior of stationary marked point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stationary configurations of points in Euclidean space which are marked by positive random variables called scores. The scores are allowed to depend on the relative positions of other points and outside sources of randomness. Such models have been thoroughly studied in stochastic geometry, e.g.\ in the context of random tessellations or random geometric graphs.
  It turns out that in a neighbourhood of a point with an extreme score one can often rescale positions and scores of nearby points to obtain a limiting point process, which we call the tail configuration. Under some assumptions on dependence between scores, this local limit determines the global asymptotics for extreme scores within increasing windows in $\R^d$. The main result establishes the convergence of rescaled positions and clusters of high scores to a Poisson cluster process, quantifying the idea of the Poisson clumping heuristic by D.~Aldous (in the point process setting). In contrast to the existing results, our framework allows for explicit calculation of essentially all extremal quantities related to the limiting behavior of extremes.
  We apply our results to models based on (marked) Poisson processes where the scores depend on the distance to the $k$th nearest neighbor and where scores are allowed to propagate through a random network of points depending on their locations.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree II: Overview and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively (from the root) split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of this model (in discrete or continuous versions) is an active research topic. For many results there are different proofs, probabilistic or analytic, so the model provides a testbed for a ``compare and contrast" discussion of techniques. This article provides an overview of results proved in the sequence of similarly-titled articles I, III, IV and related articles. We mostly do not repeat proofs given elsewhere: instead we seek to paint a ``Big Picture" via graphics and heuristics, and emphasize open problems.
  Our discussion is centered around three categories of results. (i) There is a CLT for leaf heights, and the analytic proofs can be extended to provide surprisingly precise analysis of other height-related aspects. (ii) There is an explicit description of the limit {\em fringe distribution} relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies. (iii) There is a canonical embedding of the discrete model into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. The family (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction of (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure CTCS($\infty$) formalized via exchangeable partitions.
  Many open problems remain, in particular to elucidate a relation between CTCS($\infty$) and the $\beta(2,1)$ coalescent.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Anisotropic Viscosities for the Stochastic Primitive Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viscosity parameters play a fundamental role in applications involving stochastic primitive equations (SPE), such as accurate weather predictions, climate modeling, and ocean current simulations. In this paper, we develop several novel estimators for the anisotropic viscosities in the SPE, using a finite number of Fourier modes of a single sample path observed within a finite time interval. The focus is on analyzing the consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators. We consider a torus domain and treat strong, pathwise solutions in the presence of additive white noise (in time). Notably, the analysis for estimating horizontal and vertical viscosities differs due to the unique structure of the SPE and the fact that both parameters of interest are adjacent to the highest-order derivative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the estimation of anisotropic viscosities, with the potential applicability of the developed methodology to other models.</description>

      <title>On the size of temporal cliques in subcritical random temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{random temporal graph} is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$, together with a random ordering of its edges. A path in the graph is called \emph{increasing} if the edges on the path appear in increasing order. A set $S$ of vertices forms a \emph{temporal clique} if for all $u,v \in S$, there is an increasing path from $u$ to $v$. \cite{Becker2023} proved that if $p=c\log n/n$ for $c&gt;1$, then, with high probability, there is a temporal clique of size $n-o(n)$. On the other hand, for $c&lt;1$, with high probability, the largest temporal clique is of size $o(n)$. In this note we improve the latter bound by showing that, for $c&lt;1$, the largest temporal clique is of \emph{constant} size with high probability.</description>

      <title>From Letters to Words and Back: Invertible Coding of Stationary Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13600v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems of statistical language modeling, we consider probability measures on infinite sequences over two countable alphabets of a different cardinality, such as letters and words. We introduce an invertible mapping between such measures, called the normalized transport, that preserves both stationarity and ergodicity. The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes and specialize bijective stationary codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport and self-avoiding codes arise in the problem of successive recurrence times. We show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which strengthens a result by Chen Moy from 1959. We also relate the entropy rates of processes linked by the normalized transport.</description>

      <title>A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We extend the construction of the semigroup of the two-dimensional delta-Bose gas in Gu, Quastel, and Tsai (2021) (based on Rajeev (1999) and Dimock and Rajeev (2004)) to a weighted $L^2$ space that allows exponentially growing functions. We further show that the semigroup of the mollified delta-Bose gas converges strongly to that of the delta-Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Behavior of Erlang-C Model: Mixing Time, Mean Queue Length and Tail Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service systems like data centers and ride-hailing are popularly modeled as queueing systems in the literature. Such systems are primarily studied in the steady state due to their analytical tractability. However, almost all applications in real life do not operate in a steady state, so there is a clear discrepancy in translating theoretical queueing results to practical applications. To this end, we provide a finite-time convergence for Erlang-C systems (also known as $M/M/n$ queues), providing a stepping stone towards understanding the transient behavior of more general queueing systems. We obtain a bound on the Chi-square distance between the finite time queue length distribution and the stationary distribution for a finite number of servers. We then use these bounds to study the behavior in the many-server heavy-traffic asymptotic regimes. The Erlang-C model exhibits a phase transition at the so-called Halfin-Whitt regime. We show that our mixing rate matches the limiting behavior in the Super-Halfin-Whitt regime, and matches up to a constant factor in the Sub-Halfin-Whitt regime.
  To prove such a result, we employ the Lyapunov-Poincar\'e approach, where we first carefully design a Lyapunov function to obtain a negative drift outside a finite set. Within the finite set, we develop different strategies depending on the properties of the finite set to get a handle on the mixing behavior via a local Poincar\'e inequality. A key aspect of our methodological contribution is in obtaining tight guarantees in these two regions, which when combined give us tight mixing time bounds. We believe that this approach is of independent interest for studying mixing in reversible countable-state Markov chains more generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generalized versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems with the probabilities being transported replaced by lower probabilities. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cella and Martin proved how, under an assumption called consonance, a credal set (i.e. a closed and convex set of probabilities) can be derived from the conformal transducer associated with transductive conformal prediction. We show that the Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) associated with such a credal set corresponds to the classical Conformal Prediction Region. In proving this result, we establish a new relationship between Conformal Prediction and Imprecise Probability (IP) theories, via the IP concept of a cloud. A byproduct of our presentation is the discovery that consonant plausibility functions are monoid homomorphisms, a new algebraic property of an IP tool.</description>

      <title>Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the effective RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG-flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG-flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equations for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ have been recently interpreted by Carosso as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris Continuity-Equation for the RG-flow as a meaningless infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the stochastic heat equation also known as the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. After a pedestrian self-contained introduction to this stochastic formulation of RG-flows, we focus on the case where the field theory is defined on the large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via an appropriate adaptation of the Carosso stochastic RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.</description>
