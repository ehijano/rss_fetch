      <title>Rate-Adaptive Semantic Communication via Multi-Stage Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed \textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex, with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information (DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core'' performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics, organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN testing.</description>

      <title>Denoising and Augmentation: A Dual Use of Diffusion Model for Enhanced CSI Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Neyman Pearson Detector for Multiple Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons using Near-Perfect Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty. Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in practical multi-tag environments.</description>

      <title>Pioneering Scalable Prototyping for Mid-Band XL-MIMO Systems: Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems, the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems, posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements, and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12 users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of 15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80 bit/s/Hz.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Positioning in Cellular Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning, and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Electrophysiological and Histological Mapping of Upper Limb Nerves in Pigs Using Epineural Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Inc-GAN for Tunnel Propagation Modeling from Sparse Line Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed railway tunnel communication systems require reliable radio wave propagation prediction to ensure operational safety. However, conventional simulation methods face challenges of high computational complexity and inability to effectively process sparse measurement data collected during actual railway operations. This letter proposes an inception-enhanced generative adversarial network (Inc-GAN) that can reconstruct complete electric field distributions across tunnel cross-sections using sparse value lines measured during actual train operations as input. This directly addresses practical railway measurement constraints. Through an inception-based generator architecture and progressive training strategy, the method achieves robust reconstruction from single measurement signal lines to complete field distributions. Numerical simulation validation demonstrates that Inc-GAN can accurately predict electric fields based on measured data collected during actual train operations, with significantly improved computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, providing a novel solution for railway communication system optimization based on real operational data.</description>

      <title>Compressed Multiband Sensing in FR3 Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization. Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability (SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz) for 6G systems.</description>

      <title>A Study of Neural Polar Decoders for Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements, the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics, resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the 5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.</description>

      <title>An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Position and Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Based on Euclidean Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular method to estimate the positions or directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple sound sources using an array of microphones is based on steered-response power (SRP) beamforming. For a three-dimensional scenario, SRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for position estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for multi-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed multi-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable, representing the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs to be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and set of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated absolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each source. The proposed multi-source DOA estimation method entirely eliminates the need for continuous variable optimization by defining a relative coordinate system per source such that one of its coordinate axes is aligned with the respective source DOA. The optimal set of candidate TDOA estimates is determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of a rank-reduced Gram matrix. The computational cost of the proposed EDM-based methods is significantly reduced compared to the SRP-based methods. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations show that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the SRP-based method in terms of two-source position and DOA estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anti-Jamming Modulation for OFDM Systems under Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers, enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver, we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method. Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Based VNIR Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset for Landmine and UXO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic induction (EMI) data from the same test field.</description>

      <title>FSMA: Scalable and Reliable LoRa for Non-Terrestrial Networks with Mobile Gateways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for universal IoT applications and the growing use of drones in emergency services, agriculture, and military operations highlight the transformative potential of non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, these networks face two key challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and (2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free, link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA, and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Delay-Tolerant Augmented-Consensus-based Distributed Directed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning, data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Design of Distributed MIMO ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems raise unprecedented challenges regarding security and privacy since related applications involve the gathering of sensitive, identifiable information about people and the environment, which can lead to privacy leakage. Privacy-aware measures can steer the design of ISAC systems to prevent privacy violations. Thus, we explore this perspective for the design of distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. For this purpose, we introduce an adversarial model where a malicious user exploits the interference from ISAC signals to extract sensing information. To mitigate this threat, we propose an iterative privacy-aware framework of two blocks: precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims to minimize the mutual information between the sensing and communication signals by imposing constraints on sensing and communication performance and maximum transmit power. The access point selection also aims to minimize the mutual information between communication and sensing signals by strategically selecting access points that transmit ISAC signals, and sensing receivers. Results show a reduction in the effectiveness of the attack measured by the probability of detection of the attacker.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>

      <title>Radiation Pattern Reconfigurable FAS-Empowered Interference-Resilient UAV Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights. However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology, which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore, RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile, we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally, alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users. Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies; therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users. Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline, achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exactly or Approximately Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation According to Wasserstein Radii Being Small or Large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.</description>
