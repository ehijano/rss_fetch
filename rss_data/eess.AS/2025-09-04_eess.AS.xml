      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Sound Field Reconstruction with Spherical and Linear Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical microphone arrays (SMAs) are widely used for sound field analysis, and sparse recovery (SR) techniques can significantly enhance their spatial resolution by modeling the sound field as a sparse superposition of dominant plane waves. However, the spatial resolution of SMAs is fundamentally limited by their spherical harmonic order, and their performance often degrades in reverberant environments. This paper proposes a two-stage SR framework with residue refinement that integrates observations from a central SMA and four surrounding linear microphone arrays (LMAs). The core idea is to exploit complementary spatial characteristics by treating the SMA as a primary estimator and the LMAs as a spatially complementary refiner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SMA-LMA method significantly enhances spatial energy map reconstruction under varying reverberation conditions, compared to both SMA-only and direct one-step joint processing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing spatial fidelity and robustness in complex acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear. Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally, we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at https://libriquote.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Enhancement via Domain Invariant Embedding Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement models achieve remarkable performance when test distributions match training conditions, but often degrade when deployed in unpredictable real-world environments with domain shifts. To address this challenge, we present LaDen (latent denoising), the first test-time adaptation method specifically designed for speech enhancement. Our approach leverages powerful pre-trained speech representations to perform latent denoising, approximating clean speech representations through a linear transformation of noisy embeddings. We show that this transformation generalizes well across domains, enabling effective pseudo-labeling for target domains without labeled target data. The resulting pseudo-labels enable effective test-time adaptation of speech enhancement models across diverse acoustic environments. We propose a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple datasets with various domain shifts, including changes in noise types, speaker characteristics, and languages. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LaDen consistently outperforms baseline methods across perceptual metrics, particularly for speaker and language domain shifts.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Interactive Auralization of Highly Reverberant Spaces using Graphics Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.</description>

      <title>Speech-Based Cognitive Screening: A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Adaptation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach. We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection, reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs (SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA), designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models, failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education, and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation, while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains involving high-stakes communication.</description>

      <title>SwinSRGAN: Swin Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Speech Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SR) reconstructs high-frequency content from low-resolution speech signals. Existing systems often suffer from representation mismatch in two-stage mel-vocoder pipelines and from over-smoothing of hallucinated high-band content by CNN-only generators. Diffusion and flow models are computationally expensive, and their robustness across domains and sampling rates remains limited. We propose SwinSRGAN, an end-to-end framework operating on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) magnitudes. It is a Swin Transformer-based U-Net that captures long-range spectro-temporal dependencies with a hybrid adversarial scheme combines time-domain MPD/MSD discriminators with a multi-band MDCT discriminator specialized for the high-frequency band. We employs a sparse-aware regularizer on arcsinh-compressed MDCT to better preserve transient components. The system upsamples inputs at various sampling rates to 48 kHz in a single pass and operates in real time. On standard benchmarks, SwinSRGAN reduces objective error and improves ABX preference scores. In zero-shot tests on HiFi-TTS without fine-tuning, it outperforms NVSR and mdctGAN, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets</description>

      <title>Window Function-less DFT with Reduced Noise and Latency for Real-Time Music Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music analysis applications demand algorithms that can provide both high time and frequency resolution while minimizing noise in an already-noisy signal. Real-time analysis additionally demands low latency and low computational requirements. We propose a DFT-based algorithm that accomplishes all these requirements by extending a method that post-processes DFT output without the use of window functions. Our approach yields greatly reduced sidelobes and noise, and improves time resolution without sacrificing frequency resolution. We use exponentially spaced output bins which directly map to notes in music. The resulting improved performance, compared to existing FFT and DFT-based approaches, creates possibilities for improved real-time visualizations, and contributes to improved analysis quality in other applications such as automatic transcription.</description>

      <title>Exposing Synthetic Speech: Model Attribution and Detection of AI-generated Speech via Audio Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As speech generation technologies continue to advance in quality and accessibility, the risk of malicious use cases, including impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing, increases rapidly. This work addresses this threat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for detecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model. Specifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample was generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access only to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known pool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus real speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the difference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either a low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these residuals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis systems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution. Across extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99% in most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real speech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems. In addition, our robustness analysis underscores the method's ability to maintain high performance even in the presence of moderate additive noise. Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong generalization across speech synthesis systems and languages, this technique offers a practical tool for digital forensics and security applications.</description>

      <title>SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongBloom_demo. The code and model weights have been released on https://github.com/Cypress-Yang/SongBloom .</description>

      <title>CUHK-EE Systems for the vTAD Challenge at NCMMSC 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) systems developed by the Digital Signal Processing &amp; Speech Technology Laboratory (DSP&amp;STL) of the Department of Electronic Engineering (EE) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for the 20th National Conference on Human-Computer Speech Communication (NCMMSC 2025) vTAD Challenge. The proposed systems leverage WavLM-Large embeddings with attentive statistical pooling (ASTP) to extract robust speaker representations, followed by two variants of Diff-Net, i.e., Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation-enhanced Residual FFN (SE-ResFFN), to compare timbre attribute intensities between utterance pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the WavLM-Large+FFN system generalises better to unseen speakers, achieving 77.96% accuracy and 21.79% equal error rate (EER), while the WavLM-Large+SE-ResFFN model excels in the 'Seen' setting with 94.42% accuracy and 5.49% EER. These findings highlight a trade-off between model complexity and generalisation, and underscore the importance of architectural choices in fine-grained speaker modelling. Our analysis also reveals the impact of speaker identity, annotation subjectivity, and data imbalance on system performance, pointing to future directions for improving robustness and fairness in timbre attribute detection.</description>

Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in improving human-machine interactions, offering valuable real-world applications such as language learning for children. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly interaction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for low-resource languages. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, which can be used to facilitate young children's communication with AI systems through culturally relevant context in three low-resource languages: Singaporean accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiGen compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>From Evaluation to Optimization: Neural Speech Assessment for Downstream Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of synthetic and processed speech has long been a cornerstone of audio engineering and speech science. Although subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality and intelligibility, their high cost, time requirements, and limited scalability present significant challenges in the rapid development cycles of modern speech technologies. Traditional objective metrics, while computationally efficient, often rely on a clean reference signal, making them intrusive approaches. This presents a major limitation, as clean signals are often unavailable in real-world applications. In recent years, numerous neural network-based speech assessment models have been developed to predict quality and intelligibility, achieving promising results. Beyond their role in evaluation, these models are increasingly integrated into downstream speech processing tasks. This review focuses on their role in two main areas: (1) serving as differentiable perceptual proxies that not only assess but also guide the optimization of speech enhancement and synthesis models; and (2) enabling the detection of salient speech characteristics to support more precise and efficient downstream processing. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline future research directions to further advance the integration of speech assessment into speech processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Speech Intelligibility Assessment with Uncertainty-Aware Whisper Embeddings and sLSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction remains challenging due to variability in speakers, noise conditions, and subjective perception. We propose an uncertainty-aware approach that leverages Whisper embeddings in combination with statistical features, specifically the mean, standard deviation, and entropy computed across the embedding dimensions. The entropy, computed via a softmax over the feature dimension, serves as a proxy for uncertainty, complementing global information captured by the mean and standard deviation. To model the sequential structure of speech, we adopt a scalar long short-term memory (sLSTM) network, which efficiently captures long-range dependencies. Building on this foundation, we propose iMTI-Net, an improved multi-target intelligibility prediction network that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) and sLSTM components within a multitask learning framework. It jointly predicts human intelligibility scores and machine-based word error rates (WER) from Google ASR and Whisper. Experimental results show that iMTI-Net outperforms the original MTI-Net across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating uncertainty-aware features and the CNN-sLSTM architecture.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Voice: Towards Continuous 3D Hand Pose Tracking on Commercial Home Assistant Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surging popularity of home assistants and their voice user interface (VUI) have made them an ideal central control hub for smart home devices. However, current form factors heavily rely on VUI, which poses accessibility and usability issues; some latest ones are equipped with additional cameras and displays, which are costly and raise privacy concerns. These concerns jointly motivate Beyond-Voice, a novel high-fidelity acoustic sensing system that allows commodity home assistant devices to track and reconstruct hand poses continuously. It transforms the home assistant into an active sonar system using its existing onboard microphones and speakers. We feed a high-resolution range profile to the deep learning model that can analyze the motions of multiple body parts and predict the 3D positions of 21 finger joints, bringing the granularity for acoustic hand tracking to the next level. It operates across different environments and users without the need for personalized training data. A user study with 11 participants in 3 different environments shows that Beyond-Voice can track joints with an average mean absolute error of 16.47mm without any training data provided by the testing subject.</description>

      <title>CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker's mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback. In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.</description>

      <title>Separate to Collaborate: Dual-Stream Diffusion Model for Coordinated Piano Hand Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating the synthesis of coordinated bimanual piano performances poses significant challenges, particularly in capturing the intricate choreography between the hands while preserving their distinct kinematic signatures. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate synchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the critical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based generation framework that independently models each hand's motion via dual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while leveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated Asymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise to highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing inter-hand coordination during denoising. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

      <title>Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: a Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly in many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and identify which design choices influence performance the most. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: auto-regressive decoding and conditional flow-matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

      <title>AImoclips: A Benchmark for Evaluating Emotion Conveyance in Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.</description>

      <title>EZhouNet:A framework based on graph neural network and anchor interval for the respiratory sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds. The reference implementation is available at https://github.com/chumingqian/EzhouNet.</description>

      <title>FireRedTTS-2: Towards Long Conversational Speech Generation for Podcast and Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers. Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody.
