      <title>Advancing Computational Tools for Analyzing Commutative Hypercomplex Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commutative hypercomplex algebras offer significant advantages over traditional quaternions due to their compatibility with linear algebra techniques and efficient computational implementation, which is crucial for broad applicability. This paper explores a novel family of commutative hypercomplex algebras, referred to as (alpha,beta)-tessarines, which extend the system of generalized Segre's quaternions and, consequently, elliptic quaternions. The main contribution of this work is the development of theoretical and computational tools for matrices within this algebraic system, including inversion, square root computation, LU factorization with partial pivoting, and determinant calculation. Additionally, a spectral theory for (alpha,beta)-tessarines is established, covering eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis, the power method, singular value decomposition, rank-k approximation, and the pseudoinverse. Solutions to the classical least squares problem are also presented. These results not only enhance the fundamental understanding of hypercomplex algebras but also provide researchers with novel matrix operations that have not been extensively explored in previous studies. The theoretical findings are supported by real-world examples, including image reconstruction and color face recognition, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, Riemannian geometry, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $n \geq 1$ and sign pattern $\epsilon \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$, we introduce a cone of real symmetric matrices $LPM_n(\epsilon)$: those with leading principal $k \times k$ minors of signs $\epsilon_k$. These cones are pairwise disjoint and their union $LPM_n$ is a dense cone in all symmetric matrices; they subsume positive and negative definite matrices, and symmetric (P-,) N-, PN-, almost P-, and almost N- matrices. We show that each $LPM_n$ matrix $A$ admits an uncountable family of Cholesky-type factorizations - yielding a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with positive diagonals - with additional attractive properties: (i) each such factorization is algorithmic; and (ii) each such Cholesky map $A \mapsto L$ is a smooth diffeomorphism from $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ onto an open Euclidean ball.
  We then show that (iii) the (diffeomorphic) balls $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ are isometric Riemannian manifolds as well as isomorphic abelian Lie groups, each equipped with a translation-invariant Riemannian metric (and hence Riemannian means/barycentres). Moreover, (iv) this abelian metric group structure on each $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ - and hence the log-Cholesky metric on Cholesky space - yields an isometric isomorphism onto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex version of this also holds.
  In the latter part, we show that the abelian group $PD_n$ of positive definite matrices, with its bi-invariant log-Cholesky metric, is precisely the identity-component of a larger group with an alternate metric: the dense cone $LPM_n$. This also holds for Hermitian matrices over several subfields $\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As a result, (v) the groups $LPM_n^{\mathbb{F}}$ and $LPM_\infty^{\mathbb{F}}$ admit a rich probability theory, and the cones $LPM_n(\epsilon), TPM_n(\epsilon)$ admit Wishart densities with signed Bartlett decompositions.</description>

      <title>On realizations of the complex Lie groups $ (E_{6,\mathbb{R}})^C, (E_{6,\mathbb{C}})^C, (E_{6,\mathbb{H}})^C $ and those real forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist six Lie groups of type $ E_6 $, and to be specific, ${E_6}^C , E_6, E_{6(6)}, E_{6(-2)}, E_{6(-14)}, E_{6(-26)}$. In order to define these groups, we use usually the Cayley algebra $ \mathfrak{C} $ and the split Cayley algebra $ \mathfrak{C}' $. In the present article, we consider the Lie groups which are defined by replacing $ \mathfrak{C}^C, \mathfrak{C} $ and $ \mathfrak{C}' $ with the fields of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, split complex numbers $\mathbb{C}'$, quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ and split quaternions $\mathbb{H}'$. For instance, the group $(E_{6,\mathbb{R}})^C$ is given as a group defined by replacing $\mathfrak{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}$ in ${E_6}^C$ and the group $E_{6(-26),\mathbb{H}}$ is given as a group defined by replacing $\mathfrak{C}$ with $\mathbb{H}$ in $E_{6(-26)}$. We call { \it realization} to determine the structure of the group.</description>

      <title>Commutative Quantale and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the localization construction for quantales. A quantale is a complete semilattice combined with a multiplication. We mimic the notion of filter in a lattice to define multiplicative filters in a quantale, and construct the localization of the quantale at a multiplicative filter. We prove theorems with similar structure as "$\Spec R$ is a sheaf" and use them to obtain several results in algebra and geometry, including the Baire Category Theorem and some of its generalizations. We also present an algebraic version of Baire Category Theorem, which we believe has not appeared in literature.</description>

Abstract: Some results on (pre-)Jacobi-Jordan algebras and their representations are proved. Moreover, the notion of matched pairs and relative Rota-Baxter operators on these algebras are introduced and studied. The cohomology theory of relative Rota-Baxter operators on (pre)-Jacobi-Jordan algebras is introduced. We use the cohomological approach to study linear deformations of relative Rota-Baxter operators. In particular, the notion of Nijenhuis elements is introduced to characterize trivial linear deformations.</description>

      <title>Reynolds Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a bialgebra theory for Reynolds Lie algebras. First we introduce the notion of a quadratic Reynolds Lie algebra and show that it induces an isomorphism from the adjoint representation to the coadjoint representation. Then we introduce the notion of matched pairs, Manin triples and bialgebras for Reynolds Lie algebras, and show that Manin triples, bialgebras and certain matched pairs of Reynolds Lie algebras are equivalent. In particular, we introduce the notion of a Reynolds operator on a quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebra which can induce a Reynolds Lie bialgebra naturally. Finally, we introduce the notion of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Reynolds Lie algebra whose solutions give rise to Reynolds Lie bialgebras. We also introduce the notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators on a Reynolds Lie algebra and Reynolds pre-Lie algebras, and construct solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in terms of relative Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Graded chain conditions and graded Jacobson radical of groupoid graded modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to lay the groundwork for the theory of groupoid graded rings and modules. The main topics we address include graded chain conditions, the graded Jacobson radical, and the gr-socle for graded modules. We present several descending (ascending) chain conditions for graded modules and we refer to the most general one as $\Gamma_0$-artinian ($\Gamma_0$-noetherian). We show that $\Gamma_0$-artinian (resp. $\Gamma_0$-noetherian) modules share many properties with artinian (noetherian) modules in the classical theory. However, we present an example of a right $\Gamma_0$-artinian ring that is not right $\Gamma_0$-noetherian. Following the pattern of the classical case, we examine the basic properties of the graded Jacobson radical and the gr-socle for groupoid graded modules. We also establish some fundamental properties of the graded Jacobson radical of groupoid graded rings. Finally, we introduce the notion of gr-semilocal ring, which simultaneously generalizes the concepts of semilocal ring and semilocal (small) category.</description>

      <title>The Dixmier problem for skew PBW extensions and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss for skew $PBW$ extensions the famous Dixmier problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier in 1968. The skew $PBW$ extensions are noncommutative rings of polynomial type and covers several algebras and rings arising in mathematical physics and noncommutative algebraic geometry. For this purpose, we introduce the Dixmier algebras and we will study the Dixmier problem for algebras over commutative rings, in particular, for $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, i.e., for arbitrary rings. The results are focused on the investigation of the Dixmier problem for matrix algebras, product of algebras, tensor product of algebras and also on the Dixmier question for the following particular key skew $PBW$ extension: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ be the $K$-algebra generated by $n\geq 2$ elements $x_1,\dots,x_n$ subject to relations
  $$x_jx_i=x_ix_j+d_{ij}, \ for \ all \ 1\leq i&lt;j\leq n, \ with \ d_{ij}\in K-\{0\}$$.
  We prove that the algebra $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is central and simple. In the last section we present a matrix-computational approach to the problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier and also we compute some concrete nontrivial examples of automorphisms of the first Weyl algebra $A_1(K)$ and $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ using the MAPLE library SPBWE developed for the first author. We compute the inverses of these automorphisms, and for $A_1(K)$, its factorization through some elementary automorphisms. For $n$ odd, we found some endomorphisms of $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ that are not automorphisms. We conjecture that $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is Dixmier when $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>G-dimensions for DG-modules over commutative DG-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a notion of G-dimension for DG-modules over a non-positively graded commutative noetherian DG-ring $A$. Some criteria for the finiteness of the G-dimension of a DG-module are given by applying a DG-version of projective resolution introduced by Minamoto [Israel J. Math. 245 (2021) 409-454]. Moreover, it is proved that the finiteness of G-dimension characterizes the local Gorenstein property of $A$. Applications go in three directions. The first is to establish the connection between G-dimensions and the little finitistic dimensions of &amp;\mathcal{A}&amp;. The second is to characterize Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein DG-rings by the relations between the class of maximal local-Cohen-Macaulay DG-modules and a special G-class of DG-modules. The third is to extend the classical Buchwtweiz-Happel Theorem and its inverse from commutative noetherian local rings to the setting of commutative noetherian local DG-rings.Our method is somewhat different from classical commutative ring.</description>

      <title>Rationality problem for norm one tori for $A_5$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16187v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete answer to the rationality problem (up to stable $k$-equivalence) for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ whose Galois closures $L/k$ are $A_5\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions. In particular, we prove that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{8})$, $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\simeq (C_2)^3$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^3\rtimes C_7$ where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$ by using GAP computations with the aid of PARI/GP. Based on the result, we conjecture that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{2^d})$, $(C_2)^d\leq H\leq (C_2)^d\rtimes C_{2^d-1}$. Some other cases $G\simeq A_n$, $S_n$, ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PSL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$ and $H\lneq G$ are also investigated for small $n$ and $p^d$.</description>

      <title>Fano schemes of sub-maximal elementary symmetric functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</description>
