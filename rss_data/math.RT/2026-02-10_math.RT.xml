      <title>Silting and tilting objects in cleft extensions of abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish connections between silting and tilting objects in an abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ and those in a cleft extension $\mathcal{A}$ of $\mathcal{B}$, which provides a method for constructing more silting and tilting objects. Then we apply our results to the cleft extensions of module categories, and characterize silting and tilting modules over $\theta$-extension of rings. Some known results over trivial extension of rings are extended and strengthened.</description>

      <title>On representations of the triplet group and some of its extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the representations of the triplet group $L_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and its extensions to the virtual and welded triplet groups $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, respectively. We first introduce $L_n$, its extensions, and its pure subgroup. We then investigate several representations, proving the irreducibility of the classical Tits representation $\Theta: L_n \to \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ and constructing a new representation $\mu: L_n \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is the free group of rank $n$. For the representation $\mu$, we determine its matrix form, faithfulness, and irreducibility. We also classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_n$ for $n \ge 3$ and all non-homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_3$, establishing connections with the complex specialization of the representation $\mu$. Finally, we examine extensions of $L_n$ representations to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, proving their existence, classifying non-trivial complex homogeneous $2$-local representations, and analyzing their faithfulness and irreducibility. The paper concludes with an open question regarding further extension of representation of $L_n$ to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the cluster monomials in non-initial cluster variables are uniquely determined by the Newton polytopes of their $F$-polynomials for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras. Accordingly, we prove that the $\tau$-rigid modules and the left finite multi-simibricks in $\tau$-tilting theory are uniquely determined by their Newton polytopes of these modules.</description>

      <title>The Global Jacquet-Langlands Correspondence via Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the global Jacquet--Langlands correspondence ${\rm JL}$ for ${\rm GL}(2)$ can be realized via tensor products over Hecke algebras. Let $G$ be a non-split inner form of ${\rm GL}(2)$ over a number field. Using the similitude theta correspondence, the space $L^2(D(\mathbb{A})\times \mathbb{A}^{\times})$ acquires the structure of a $G(\mathbb{A})$-$(G(\mathbb{A})\times {\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{A}))$ bimodule such that
  $L^2(G(F)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}),\chi)\otimes_{\mathcal{H}(G)}L^2(D(\mathbb{A})\times \mathbb{A}^{\times})~\cong~\oplus_{\pi\in {\mathcal{A}}(G,\chi^{-1})}$ $\pi\otimes{\rm JL}(\pi).$
  This decomposition into irreducible representations of $G(\mathbb{A})\times {\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{A})$ recovers the full global Jacquet-Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>Irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of R. Travkin and R. Yang, initially conjectured by D. Gaiotto, states that for a generic (not a root of unity) $q$ the category of $q$-twisted D-modules on the affine Grassmannian $Gr_{GL_N}$ which are equivariant with respect to a certain subgroup (defined by a choice of $0 \le M &lt;N$) of $GL_N$ is equivalent to the category of representations of the quantum supergroup $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(M|N))$. We aim to see whether this equivalence should hold when $q$ is a root of unity. We begin by asking if there is a natural bijection between the sets of irreducible objects. In this note we make an observation that suggests this should be the case: we show that there is a natural bijection between irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category and in the category of representations of a supergroup $GL(M|N)$ in positive characteristic. The proof is based on the version of the Serganova's algorithm formulated by J. Brundan and J. Kujawa in arXiv:math/0210108.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Kirillov bound for $p$-adic Banach representations with infinitesimal character for $\text{GL}_2$ and quaternion units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an admissible $p$-adic Banach representation of $\text{GL}_2K$ whose locally analytic vectors have an infinitesimal character has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension $\leq[K\colon\mathbf Q_p]$, where $p&gt;2$ and $K$ is a $p$-adic field. We also prove this for the group of units of the quaternions over $K$ replacing $\text{GL}_2K$. In the process, we make some observations in the theory of $p$-adic Banach representations that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reflection Theory of Nichols Algebras over Coquasi-Hopf Algebras with Bijective Antipode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reflection theory of Nichols algebras over arbitrary coquasi-Hopf algebras with bijective antipode, generalizing previous results restricted to the pointed cosemisimple setting [47]. By establishing a braided monoidal equivalence between categories of rational Yetter-Drinfeld modules via a dual pair, we demonstrate that a tuple of finite-dimensional irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules admitting all reflections gives rise to a semi-Cartan graph. As an application, we consider an explicit example of a rank three Nichols algebra from [41]. We show that it yields a standard Cartan graph and prove that it is, in fact, an affine Nichols algebra.</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-Sign Consistency Verification of Hankel Matrices via Schur Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign.
  More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.</description>

      <title>Plethysm is in #BQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.
  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</description>

      <title>Some notes on tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025.
  The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories.
  The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</description>

      <title>Spaltenstein Varieties Associated with Pseudo-Polarizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce minimal Richardson orbits and pseudo-polarizations for nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras of types B, C, and D. For any nilpotent orbit, we classify all minimal Richardson orbits containing it and thereby determine the associated pseudo-polarizations. We prove that the corresponding Spaltenstein varieties are smooth and pure dimensional, with iterated orthogonal/isotropic Grassmannian fibrations. As an application, we extend the seesaw property and duality of Fu-Ruan-Wen from Richardson orbits to all special orbits in types B and C.</description>

      <title>Conformally flat factorization homology in Ind-Hilbert spaces and Conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories.
  The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d&gt;2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of partially defined complete positivity preservers, extending Schoenberg's classical characterization to functions defined only on discrete subsets or constrained domains. We frame the extension problem through the theory of completely positive maps on operator systems -- we characterize general partially defined completely positive definite functions on general homogeneous spaces. We apply our interpolation to constrained packing problems and Delsarte theory, where one uses positive definite functions on homogeneous spaces to obtain bounds on various packing problems. We prove the specific positive definite function witnesses that a code is sharp for constrained angle codes must be from polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bethe subalgebras in antidominantly shifted Yangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The loop group $G((z^{-1}))$ of a simple complex Lie group $G$ has a natural Poisson structure. We introduce a natural family of Poisson commutative subalgebras $\overline{{\mathbf{B}}}(C) \subset \mathcal{O}(G((z^{-1}))$ depending on the parameter $C\in G$ called classical universal Bethe subalgebras. To every antidominant cocharacter $\mu$ of the maximal torus $T \subset G$ one can associate the closed Poisson subspace $\mathcal{W}_\mu$ of $G((z^{-1}))$ (the Poisson algebra $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_\mu)$ is the classical limit of so-called shifted Yangian $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{g})$). We consider the images of $\overline{{\mathbf{B}}}(C)$ in $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_\mu)$, that we denote by $\overline{B}_\mu(C)$, that should be considered as classical versions of (not yet defined in general) Bethe subalgebras in shifted Yangians. For regular $C$ centralizing $\mu$, we compute the Poincar\'e series of these subalgebras. For $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_n$, we define the natural quantization ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))))$ and universal Bethe subalgebras ${\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset {\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. Using the RTT realization of $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ (invented by Frassek, Pestun, and Tsymbaliuk), we obtain the natural surjections ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n) \twoheadrightarrow Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ which quantize the embedding $\mathcal{W}_\mu \subset \operatorname{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))$). Taking the images of ${\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ we recover Bethe subalgebras $B_\mu(C) \subset Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ proposed by Frassek, Pestun and Tsymbaliuk.</description>

      <title>Duality properties for induced and coinduced representations in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of positive characteristic $p&gt;2$. We prove a duality property concerning the kernel of coinduced representations of Lie superalgebras. This property was already proved by M. Duflo for Lie algebras in any characteristic under more restrictive finiteness conditions. It was then generalized to Lie superalgebras in characteristic 0 in previous works of the author. In a second part of the article, we study the links between coinduced representations and induced representations in the case of restricted Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Category $\mathcal{O}$ for hybrid quantum groups and non-commutative Springer resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid quantum group was firstly introduced by Gaitsgory, whose category $\mathcal{O}$ can be viewed as a quantum analogue of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$. We give a coherent model for its principal block at roots of unity, using the non-commutative Springer resolution defined by Bezrukavnikov--Mirkovi\'{c}. In particular, the principal block is derived equivalent to the affine Hecke category. As an application, we endow the principal block with a canonical grading, and show that the graded multiplicity of simple module in Verma module is given by the generic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial.</description>

      <title>Contraction of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Triple Associated to the $(k,a)$-Generalized Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ben Sa\"{\i}d-Kobayashi-Orsted introduced a family of $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $-triples of differential-difference operators $ \mathbb{H}_{k,a} $, $ \mathbb{E}^+_{k,a} $ and $ \mathbb{E}^-_{k,a} $ on $ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\} $ indexed by a Dunkl parameter $ k $ and a deformation parameter $ a \neq 0 $. In the present paper, we study the behavior as the parameter $ a $ approaches $ 0 $. In this limit, the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,a} = \operatorname{span}_\mathbb{R} \bigl\{\mathbb{H}_{k,a}, \mathbb{E}^+_{k,a}, \mathbb{E}^-_{k,a}\bigr\} \cong \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}) $ contracts to a three-dimensional commutative Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$, and its spectral properties change. We describe the joint spectral decomposition for $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$, and discuss formulas for operator semigroups with infinitesimal generators in $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$. In particular, we describe the integral kernel of $ \exp\bigl(z |x|^2 \Delta_k\bigr) $ as an infinite series, which, in some low-dimensional cases, can be expressed in a closed form using the theta function.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each endotrivial complex arising from Bredon homology of a representation sphere, we construct $p$-local quasi-isomorphisms, called forerunners, enabling us to extend Balmer--Gallauer's results in arXiv:2307.04398 Part II concerning the tensor-triangular geometry of permutation modules for elementary abelian $p$-groups to all $p$-groups. We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure. We prove Noetherianity holds for Dedekind groups and all $p$-groups of order at most $p^3$, and conjecture Noetherianity holds for all finite $p$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the homogeneous $3$-local representations of the twin group $T_n$, the virtual twin group $VT_n$, and the welded twin group $WT_n$, for all $n\geq 4$. Beyond this classification, we examine the main characteristics of these representations, particularly their irreducibility and faithfulness. More deeply, we show that all such representations are reducible, and most of them are unfaithful. Also, we find necessary and sufficient conditions of the first two types of the classified representations of $T_n$ to be irreducible in the case $n=4$. The obtained results provide insights into the algebraic structure of these three groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective stabilization result for the sheaf cohomology groups of line bundles on flag varieties parametrizing complete flags in k^n, as well as for the sheaf cohomology groups of polynomial functors applied to the cotangent sheaf Omega on projective space. In characteristic zero, these are natural consequences of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but in characteristic p&gt;0 they are non-trivial. Unlike many important contexts in modular representation theory, where the prime characteristic p is assumed to be large relative to n, in our study we fix p and let n go to infinity. We illustrate the general theory by providing explicit stable cohomology calculations in a number of cases of interest. Our examples yield cohomology groups where the number of indecomposable summands has super-polynomial growth, and also show that the cohomological degrees where non-vanishing occurs do not form a connected interval. In the case of polynomial functors of Omega, we prove a Kunneth formula for stable cohomology, and show the invariance of stable cohomology under Frobenius, which combined with the Steinberg tensor product theorem yields calculations of stable cohomology for an interesting class of simple polynomial functors arising in the work of Doty. The results in the special case of symmetric powers of Omega provide a nice application to commutative algebra, yielding a sharp vanishing result for Koszul modules of finite length in all characteristics.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Leibniz bimodules and Grothendieck rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small \'etale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fr\'echet-Stein $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P. Etingof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a triangular decomposition for Banach and Fr\'echet-Stein algebras over $p$-adic fields, which allows us to define a category $\mathcal{O}$ for a wide array of topological algebras. In particular, we apply this concept to $p$-adic rational Cherednik algebras, which allows us to obtain an analytic version of the category $\mathcal{O}$ developed by Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam and Rouquier. Along the way, we study the global sections of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on smooth Stein spaces, and determine their behavior with respect to the rigid analytic GAGA functor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

      <title>Correspondence among congruence families for generalized Frobenius partitions via modular permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2024, Garvan, Sellers and Smoot discovered a remarkable symmetry in the families of congruences for generalized Frobenius partitions $c\psi_{2,0}$ and $c\psi_{2,1}$. They also emphasized that the considerations for the general case of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ are important for future work. In this paper, for each $k$ we construct a vector-valued modular form for the generating functions of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$, and determine an equivalence relation among all $\beta$. Within each equivalence class, we can identify modular transformations relating the congruences of one $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ to that of another $c\psi_{k,\beta'}$. Furthermore, correspondences between different equivalence classes can also be obtained through linear combinations of modular transformations. As an example, with the aid of these correspondences, we prove a family of congruences of $c\phi_{3}$, the Andrews' $3$-colored Frobenius partition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L\'evy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L\'evy and Ma\"ida with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We use representations of braid groups of Coxeter types BC and D to produce invariants of representation categories of quasitriangular coideal subalgebras. Such categories form a prevalent class of braided module categories. This is analogous to how representations of braid groups of Coxeter type A produce invariants of representation categories of quasitriangular Hopf algebras, a prevalent class of braided monoidal categories. This work also includes concrete examples, and classification results for $K$-matrices of quasitriangular coideal subalgebras.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>
