      <title>Goal-guided Generative Prompt Injection Attack on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. A large number of users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLMs model security challenges. Although there is currently a large amount of research on prompt injection attacks, most of these black-box attacks use heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these heuristic strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we redefine the goal of the attack: to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the adversarial text. Furthermore, we prove that maximizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the Mahalanobis distance between the embedded representation $x$ and $x'$ of the clean text and the adversarial text when the conditional probability is a Gaussian distribution and gives a quantitative relationship on $x$ and $x'$. Then we designed a simple and effective goal-guided generative prompt injection strategy (G2PIA) to find an injection text that satisfies specific constraints to achieve the optimal attack effect approximately. It is particularly noteworthy that our attack method is a query-free black-box attack method with low computational cost. Experimental results on seven LLM models and four datasets show the effectiveness of our attack method.</description>

      <title>Sandwich attack: Multi-language Mixture Adaptive Attack on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and applied, but their widespread use faces challenges. These include aligning LLMs' responses with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages. Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new black-box attack vector called the \emph{Sandwich attack}: a multi-language mixture attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google's Bard, Gemini Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while minimizing potential for misuse.</description>

      <title>Indoor Location Fingerprinting Privacy: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive integration of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) arises from the limitations of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in indoor environments, leading to the widespread adoption of Location-Based Services (LBS). Specifically, indoor location fingerprinting employs diverse signal fingerprints from user devices, enabling precise location identification by Location Service Providers (LSP). Despite its broad applications across various domains, indoor location fingerprinting introduces a notable privacy risk, as both LSP and potential adversaries inherently have access to this sensitive information, compromising users' privacy. Consequently, concerns regarding privacy vulnerabilities in this context necessitate a focused exploration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. In response to these concerns, this survey presents a comprehensive review of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms in Indoor Location Fingerprinting (ILFPPM) based on cryptographic, anonymization, differential privacy (DP), and federated learning (FL) techniques. We also propose a distinctive and novel grouping of privacy vulnerabilities, adversary and attack models, and available evaluation metrics specific to indoor location fingerprinting systems. Given the identified limitations and research gaps in this survey, we highlight numerous prospective opportunities for future investigation, aiming to motivate researchers interested in advancing this field. This survey serves as a valuable reference for researchers and provides a clear overview for those beyond this specific research domain.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private GANs for Generating Synthetic Indoor Location Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of location-based services has led to the widespread adoption of indoor localization systems, which enable location tracking of individuals within enclosed spaces such as buildings. While these systems provide numerous benefits such as improved security and personalized services, they also raise concerns regarding privacy violations. As such, there is a growing need for privacy-preserving solutions that can protect users' sensitive location information while still enabling the functionality of indoor localization systems. In recent years, Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks (DPGANs) have emerged as a powerful methodology that aims to protect the privacy of individual data points while generating realistic synthetic data similar to original data. DPGANs combine the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the privacy-preserving technique of differential privacy (DP). In this paper, we introduce an indoor localization framework employing DPGANs in order to generate privacy-preserving indoor location data. We evaluate the performance of our framework on a real-world indoor localization dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in preserving privacy while maintaining the accuracy of the localization system.</description>

      <title>RTL Interconnect Obfuscation By Polymorphic Switch Boxes For Secure Hardware Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic Obfuscation is a well renowned design-for-trust solution to protect an Integrated Circuit (IC) from unauthorized use and illegal overproduction by including key-gates to lock the design. This is particularly necessary for ICs manufactured at untrusted third-party foundries getting exposed to security threats. In the past, several logic obfuscation methodologies have been proposed that are vulnerable to attacks such as the Boolean Satisfiability Attack. Many of these techniques are implemented at the gate level that may involve expensive re-synthesis cycles. In this paper, we present an interconnect obfuscation scheme at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) using Switch Boxes (SBs) constructed of Polymorphic Transistors. A polymorphic SB can be designed using the same transistor count as its Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor based counterpart, thereby no increased area in comparison, but serving as an advantage in having more key-bit combinations for an attacker to correctly identify and unlock each polymorphic SB. Security-aware high-level synthesis algorithms have also been presented to increase RTL interconnects to Functional Units impacting multiple outputs such that when a polymorphic SB is strategically inserted, those outputs would be corrupted upon incorrect key-bit identification. Finally, we run the SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)-based RTL Logic Attack on the obfuscated design to examine its robustness.</description>

      <title>Privacy preserving layer partitioning for Deep Neural Network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service) has become popular in the cloud computing domain, allowing users to leverage cloud resources for running private inference of ML models on their data. However, ensuring user input privacy and secure inference execution is essential. One of the approaches to protect data privacy and integrity is to use Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) by enabling execution of programs in secure hardware enclave. Using TEEs can introduce significant performance overhead due to the additional layers of encryption, decryption, security and integrity checks. This can lead to slower inference times compared to running on unprotected hardware. In our work, we enhance the runtime performance of ML models by introducing layer partitioning technique and offloading computations to GPU. The technique comprises two distinct partitions: one executed within the TEE, and the other carried out using a GPU accelerator. Layer partitioning exposes intermediate feature maps in the clear which can lead to reconstruction attacks to recover the input. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in protecting against input reconstruction attacks developed using trained conditional Generative Adversarial Network(c-GAN). The evaluation is performed on widely used models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNetB0, using two datasets: ImageNet for Image classification and TON IoT dataset for cybersecurity attack detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Network Intrusion Detection Performance using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a pivotal role in safeguarding critical digital infrastructures against cyber threats. Machine learning-based detection models applied in NIDS are prevalent today. However, the effectiveness of these machine learning-based models is often limited by the evolving and sophisticated nature of intrusion techniques as well as the lack of diverse and updated training samples. In this research, a novel approach for enhancing the performance of an NIDS through the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed. By harnessing the power of GANs in generating synthetic network traffic data that closely mimics real-world network behavior, we address a key challenge associated with NIDS training datasets, which is the data scarcity. Three distinct GAN models (Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN and Conditional Tabular GAN) are implemented in this work to generate authentic network traffic patterns specifically tailored to represent the anomalous activity. We demonstrate how this synthetic data resampling technique can significantly improve the performance of the NIDS model for detecting such activity. By conducting comprehensive experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 benchmark dataset, augmented with GAN-generated data, we offer empirical evidence that shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our findings show that the integration of GANs into NIDS can lead to enhancements in intrusion detection performance for attacks with limited training data, making it a promising avenue for bolstering the cybersecurity posture of organizations in an increasingly interconnected and vulnerable digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Security Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are at the intersection of digital technology and engineering domains, rendering them high-value targets of sophisticated and well-funded cybersecurity threat actors. Prominent cybersecurity attacks on CPS have brought attention to the vulnerability of these systems, and the soft underbelly of critical infrastructure reliant on CPS. Security modelling for CPS is an important mechanism to systematically identify and assess vulnerabilities, threats, and risks throughout system lifecycles, and to ultimately ensure system resilience, safety, and reliability. This literature review delves into state-of-the-art research in CPS security modelling, encompassing both threat and attack modelling. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different concepts. This article elaborates on the differences between threat and attack modelling, examining their implications for CPS security. A systematic search yielded 428 articles, from which 15 were selected and categorised into three clusters: those focused on threat modelling methods, attack modelling methods, and literature reviews. Specifically, we sought to examine what security modelling methods exist today, and how they address real-world cybersecurity threats and CPS-specific attacker capabilities throughout the lifecycle of CPS, which typically span longer durations compared to traditional IT systems. This article also highlights several limitations in existing research, wherein security models adopt simplistic approaches that do not adequately consider the dynamic, multi-layer, multi-path, and multi-agent characteristics of real-world cyber-physical attacks.</description>

Abstract: In the era of cutting-edge autonomous systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an essential part of the solutions for numerous complex challenges. This paper evaluates UAV peer-to-peer telemetry communication, highlighting its security vulnerabilities and explores a transition to a het-erogeneous multi-hop mesh all-to-all communication architecture to increase inter-swarm connectivity and reliability.

      <title>Fragile Model Watermark for integrity protection: leveraging boundary volatility and sensitive sample-pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have increasingly influenced people's lives. Ensuring the faithful deployment of neural networks as designed by their model owners is crucial, as they may be susceptible to various malicious or unintentional modifications, such as backdooring and poisoning attacks. Fragile model watermarks aim to prevent unexpected tampering that could lead DNN models to make incorrect decisions. They ensure the detection of any tampering with the model as sensitively as possible.However, prior watermarking methods suffered from inefficient sample generation and insufficient sensitivity, limiting their practical applicability. Our approach employs a sample-pairing technique, placing the model boundaries between pairs of samples, while simultaneously maximizing logits. This ensures that the model's decision results of sensitive samples change as much as possible and the Top-1 labels easily alter regardless of the direction it moves.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Sensor-Based Multi-Factor Authentication in and for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication between connected objects often requires secure and reliable authentication mechanisms. These mechanisms are essential for verifying the identities of objects and preventing unauthorized access. The IoT offers several advantages and opportunities that are not necessarily found in other domains. For instance, IoT sensors collect real-time data about their environment and other objects which contain valuable information that, if used, can reinforce authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel idea for building opportunistic sensor-based authentication factors between IoT objects by leveraging the sensors already present in the systems where they interact. We claim that sensors can be utilized to build factors that reinforce object-to-object authentication mechanisms. Through the integration of these opportunistic sensor-based authentication factors into multi-factor authentication mechanisms, authentication in IoT can achieve a higher level of security. We provide illustrative experiments on two types of vehicles : mobile robots and cars.</description>

      <title>Illicit Promotion on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extensive study of the promotion of illicit goods and services on Twitter, a popular online social network(OSN). This study is made possible through the design and implementation of multiple novel tools for detecting and analyzing illicit promotion activities as well as their underlying campaigns. As the results, we observe that illicit promotion is prevalent on Twitter, along with noticeable existence on other three popular OSNs including Youtube, Facebook, and TikTok. Particularly, 12 million distinct posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) have been observed on the Twitter platform, which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 categories of illicit goods and services, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. What are also observed are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K distinct instant messaging (IM) accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as next hops of communication, which strongly indicates that the campaigns underpinning PIPs are also of a large scale. Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. On one hand, Twitter is observed to conduct content moderation in a continuous manner and almost 80% PIPs will get gradually unpublished within six months since posted. However, in the meantime, miscreants adopt various evasion tactics to masquerade their PIPs, which renders more than 90% PIPs keeping hidden from the detection radar for two months or longer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pharmaceutical manufacturing faces critical challenges due to the global threat of counterfeit drugs. This paper proposes a new approach of protected QR codes to secure unique product information for safeguarding the pharmaceutical supply chain. The proposed solution integrates secure QR code generation and encrypted data transmission to establish a comprehensive anti-counterfeit ecosystem. The protected QR codes encapsulate product information that cannot be identified using traditional QR code scanners which protect the information against replication and tampering. The system is developed with scalability in mind, which can be easily implemented without introducing any additional modification in the traditional supply chain.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Contrastive Learning via Bi-level Trigger Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has attracted enormous attention due to its remarkable capability in unsupervised representation learning. However, recent works have revealed the vulnerability of CL to backdoor attacks: the feature extractor could be misled to embed backdoored data close to an attack target class, thus fooling the downstream predictor to misclassify it as the target. Existing attacks usually adopt a fixed trigger pattern and poison the training set with trigger-injected data, hoping for the feature extractor to learn the association between trigger and target class. However, we find that such fixed trigger design fails to effectively associate trigger-injected data with target class in the embedding space due to special CL mechanisms, leading to a limited attack success rate (ASR). This phenomenon motivates us to find a better backdoor trigger design tailored for CL framework. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach to achieve this goal, where the inner optimization simulates the CL dynamics of a surrogate victim, and the outer optimization enforces the backdoor trigger to stay close to the target throughout the surrogate CL procedure. Extensive experiments show that our attack can achieve a higher attack success rate (e.g., $99\%$ ASR on ImageNet-100) with a very low poisoning rate ($1\%$). Besides, our attack can effectively evade existing state-of-the-art defenses. Code is available at: https://github.com/SWY666/SSL-backdoor-BLTO.</description>

      <title>LeapFrog: The Rowhammer Instruction Skip Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, Rowhammer exploits have rapidly evolved into increasingly sophisticated threats not only compromising data integrity but also the control flow integrity of victim processes. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for an attacker to identify vulnerable targets (i.e., Rowhammer gadgets), understand the outcome of the attempted fault, and formulate an attack that yields useful results.
  In this paper, we present a new type of Rowhammer gadget, called a LeapFrog gadget, which, when present in the victim code, allows an adversary to subvert code execution to bypass a critical piece of code (e.g., authentication check logic, encryption rounds, padding in security protocols). The Leapfrog gadget manifests when the victim code stores the Program Counter (PC) value in the user or kernel stack (e.g., a return address during a function call) which, when tampered with, re-positions the return address to a location that bypasses a security-critical code pattern.
  This research also presents a systematic process to identify Leapfrog gadgets. This methodology enables the automated detection of susceptible targets and the determination of optimal attack parameters. We first showcase this new attack vector through a practical demonstration on a TLS handshake client/server scenario, successfully inducing an instruction skip in a client application. We then demonstrate the attack on real-world code found in the wild, implementing an attack on OpenSSL.
  Our findings extend the impact of Rowhammer attacks on control flow and contribute to the development of more robust defenses against these increasingly sophisticated threats.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of Genuine Tor Traces for Realistic Website Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website fingerprinting (WF) is a dangerous attack on web privacy because it enables an adversary to predict the website a user is visiting, despite the use of encryption, VPNs, or anonymizing networks such as Tor. Previous WF work almost exclusively uses synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance and estimate the feasibility of WF attacks despite evidence that synthetic data misrepresents the real world. In this paper we present GTT23, the first WF dataset of genuine Tor traces, which we obtain through a large-scale measurement of the Tor network. GTT23 represents real Tor user behavior better than any existing WF dataset, is larger than any existing WF dataset by at least an order of magnitude, and will help ground the future study of realistic WF attacks and defenses. In a detailed evaluation, we survey 25 WF datasets published over the last 15 years and compare their characteristics to those of GTT23. We discover common deficiencies of synthetic datasets that make them inferior to GTT23 for drawing meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of WF attacks directed at real Tor users. We have made GTT23 available to promote reproducible research and to help inspire new directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Brauer Configuration Algebras and Classical Cryptanalysis to Analyze Bach's Canons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, Brauer configuration algebras (BCAs) and their specialized messages have helped research in several fields of mathematics and sciences. This paper deals with a new perspective on using such algebras as a theoretical framework in classical cryptography and music theory. It is proved that some block cyphers define labeled Brauer configuration algebras. Particularly, the dimension of the BCA associated with a ciphertext-only attack of the Vigenere cryptosystem is given by the corresponding key's length and the captured ciphertext's coincidence index. On the other hand, historically, Bach's canons have been considered solved music puzzles. However, due to how Bach posed such canons, the question remains whether their solutions are only limited to musical issues. This paper gives alternative solutions based on the theory of Brauer configuration algebras to some of the puzzle canons proposed by Bach in his Musical Offering (BWV 1079) and the canon \^a 4 Voc: Perpetuus (BWV 1073). Specifically to the canon \^a 6 Voc (BWV 1076), canon 1 \^a2 (also known as the crab canon), and canon \^a4 Quaerendo Invenietis. These solutions are obtained by interpreting such canons as ciphertexts (via route and transposition cyphers) of some specialized Brauer messages. In particular, it is noted that the structure or form of the notes used in such canons can be described via the shape of the most used symbols in Bach's works.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (multi-agent RL) with differential privacy (DP) constraints. This is well-motivated by various real-world applications involving sensitive data, where it is critical to protect users' private information. We first extend the definitions of Joint DP (JDP) and Local DP (LDP) to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games, where both definitions ensure trajectory-wise privacy protection. Then we design a provably efficient algorithm based on optimistic Nash value iteration and privatization of Bernstein-type bonuses. The algorithm is able to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements when instantiated with appropriate privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, for both notions of DP, our regret bound generalizes the best known result under the single-agent RL case, while our regret could also reduce to the best known result for multi-agent RL without privacy constraints. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first line of results towards understanding trajectory-wise privacy protection in multi-agent RL.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Subject Similarity in Differential Morphing Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of morphing attacks has posed significant security concerns for automated Face Recognition systems, raising the pressing need for robust and effective Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) methods able to effectively address this issue. In this paper, we focus on Differential MAD (D-MAD), where a trusted live capture, usually representing the criminal, is compared with the document image to classify it as morphed or bona fide. We show these approaches based on identity features are effective when the morphed image and the live one are sufficiently diverse; unfortunately, the effectiveness is significantly reduced when the same approaches are applied to look-alike subjects or in all those cases when the similarity between the two compared images is high (e.g. comparison between the morphed image and the accomplice). Therefore, in this paper, we propose ACIdA, a modular D-MAD system, consisting of a module for the attempt type classification, and two modules for the identity and artifacts analysis on input images. Successfully addressing this task would allow broadening the D-MAD applications including, for instance, the document enrollment stage, which currently relies entirely on human evaluation, thus limiting the possibility of releasing ID documents with manipulated images, as well as the automated gates to detect both accomplices and criminals. An extensive cross-dataset experimental evaluation conducted on the introduced scenario shows that ACIdA achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming literature competitors, while maintaining good performance in traditional D-MAD benchmarks.</description>

      <title>AnnoCTR: A Dataset for Detecting and Linking Entities, Tactics, and Techniques in Cyber Threat Reports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the threat landscape to be aware of actual or potential attacks is of utmost importance to cybersecurity professionals. Information about cyber threats is typically distributed using natural language reports. Natural language processing can help with managing this large amount of unstructured information, yet to date, the topic has received little attention. With this paper, we present AnnoCTR, a new CC-BY-SA-licensed dataset of cyber threat reports. The reports have been annotated by a domain expert with named entities, temporal expressions, and cybersecurity-specific concepts including implicitly mentioned techniques and tactics. Entities and concepts are linked to Wikipedia and the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledge base, the most widely-used taxonomy for classifying types of attacks. Prior datasets linking to MITRE ATT&amp;CK either provide a single label per document or annotate sentences out-of-context; our dataset annotates entire documents in a much finer-grained way. In an experimental study, we model the annotations of our dataset using state-of-the-art neural models. In our few-shot scenario, we find that for identifying the MITRE ATT&amp;CK concepts that are mentioned explicitly or implicitly in a text, concept descriptions from MITRE ATT&amp;CK are an effective source for training data augmentation.</description>

      <title>REMaQE: Reverse Engineering Math Equations from Executables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper proposes the REMaQE automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and can reverse engineer object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool "tmon". To evaluate REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations. Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented reverse engineering workflow.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy with Non-Private Pre-Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When analysing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines, the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</description>

      <title>Reflected Search Poisoning for Illicit Promotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an emerging black hat search engine optimization (SEO) technique, reflected search poisoning (RSP) allows a miscreant to free-ride the reputation of high-ranking websites, poisoning search engines with illicit promotion texts (IPTs) in an efficient and stealthy manner, while avoiding the burden of continuous website compromise as required by traditional promotion infections. However, little is known about the security implications of RSP, e.g., what illicit promotion campaigns are being distributed by RSP, and to what extent regular search users can be exposed to illicit promotion texts distributed by RSP. In this study, we conduct the first security study on RSP-based illicit promotion, which is made possible through an end-to-end methodology for capturing, analyzing, and infiltrating IPTs. As a result, IPTs distributed via RSP are found to be large-scale, continuously growing, and diverse in both illicit categories and natural languages. Particularly, we have identified over 11 million distinct IPTs belonging to 14 different illicit categories, with typical examples including drug trading, data theft, counterfeit goods, and hacking services. Also, the underlying RSP cases have abused tens of thousands of high-ranking websites, as well as extensively poisoning all four popular search engines we studied, especially Google Search and Bing. Furthermore, it is observed that benign search users are being exposed to IPTs at a concerning extent. To facilitate interaction with potential customers (victim search users), miscreants tend to embed various types of contacts in IPTs, especially instant messaging accounts. Further infiltration of these IPT contacts reveals that the underlying illicit campaigns are operated on a large scale. All these findings highlight the negative security implications of IPTs and RSPs, and thus call for more efforts to mitigate RSP-driven illicit promotion.</description>

      <title>Boosting Digital Safeguards: Blending Cryptography and Steganography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's digital age, the internet is essential for communication and the sharing of information, creating a critical need for sophisticated data security measures to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. Cryptography encrypts messages into a cipher text that is incomprehensible to unauthorized readers, thus safeguarding data during its transmission. Steganography, on the other hand, originates from the Greek term for "covered writing" and involves the art of hiding data within another medium, thereby facilitating covert communication by making the message invisible. This proposed approach takes advantage of the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), especially through the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve upon traditional steganographic methods. By embedding encrypted data within another medium, our method ensures that the communication remains hidden from prying eyes. The application of GANs enables a smart, secure system that utilizes the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to slight alterations in data, enhancing the protection against detection. By merging the encryption techniques of cryptography with the hiding capabilities of steganography, and augmenting these with the strengths of AI, we introduce a comprehensive security system designed to maintain both the privacy and integrity of information. This system is crafted not just to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data, but also to keep the existence of the data hidden. This fusion of technologies tackles the core challenges of data security in the current era of open digital communication, presenting an advanced solution with the potential to transform the landscape of information security.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Prevention in Federated Learning and Differential Privacy via Stateful Proofs of Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise in IoT-driven distributed data analytics, coupled with increasing privacy concerns, has led to a demand for effective privacy-preserving and federated data collection/model training mechanisms. In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results.
  In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security extensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP's security and low overhead.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Confidence Intervals for Proportions under Stratified Random Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confidence intervals are a fundamental tool for quantifying the uncertainty of parameters of interest. With the increase of data privacy awareness, developing a private version of confidence intervals has gained growing attention from both statisticians and computer scientists. Differential privacy is a state-of-the-art framework for analyzing privacy loss when releasing statistics computed from sensitive data. Recent work has been done around differentially private confidence intervals, yet to the best of our knowledge, rigorous methodologies on differentially private confidence intervals in the context of survey sampling have not been studied. In this paper, we propose three differentially private algorithms for constructing confidence intervals for proportions under stratified random sampling. We articulate two variants of differential privacy that make sense for data from stratified sampling designs, analyzing each of our algorithms within one of these two variants. We establish analytical privacy guarantees and asymptotic properties of the estimators. In addition, we conduct simulation studies to evaluate the proposed private confidence intervals, and two applications to the 1940 Census data are provided.</description>

      <title>Incremental Randomized Smoothing Certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing-based certification is an effective approach for obtaining robustness certificates of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.
  We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 3x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of the approximate model from scratch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despite their privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individuals deliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging their private experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficient social learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at odds with each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling information leakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differential privacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs after communicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefs provides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to their private information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learning environments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finite number of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite, intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite case leads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and making sure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our results flesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of the group decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the level of privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</description>

      <title>FedADMM-InSa: An Inexact and Self-Adaptive ADMM for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for learning from distributed data while maintaining privacy. The development of efficient FL algorithms encounters various challenges, including heterogeneous data and systems, limited communication capacities, and constrained local computational resources. Recently developed FedADMM methods show great resilience to both data and system heterogeneity. However, they still suffer from performance deterioration if the hyperparameters are not carefully tuned. To address this issue, we propose an inexact and self-adaptive FedADMM algorithm, termed FedADMM-InSa. First, we design an inexactness criterion for the clients' local updates to eliminate the need for empirically setting the local training accuracy. This inexactness criterion can be assessed by each client independently based on its unique condition, thereby reducing the local computational cost and mitigating the undesirable straggle effect. The convergence of the resulting inexact ADMM is proved under the assumption of strongly convex loss functions. Additionally, we present a self-adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts each client's penalty parameter, enhancing algorithm robustness by mitigating the need for empirical penalty parameter choices for each client. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted. As validated by some numerical tests, our proposed algorithm can reduce the clients' local computational load significantly and also accelerate the learning process compared to the vanilla FedADMM.</description>

      <title>Multi-granular Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Neural Ranking Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial ranking attacks have gained increasing attention due to their success in probing vulnerabilities, and, hence, enhancing the robustness, of neural ranking models. Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at a single granularity, e.g., word or sentence level, to target documents. However, limiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce the flexibility of adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potential threat of the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-quality adversarial examples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achieving this objective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, which requires identifying an optimal combination of perturbations across all possible levels of granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address this challenge, we transform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequential decision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step build on the perturbed document in the current attack step. Since the attack process can only access the final state without direct intermediate signals, we use reinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks. During the reinforcement learning process, two agents work cooperatively to identify multi-granular vulnerabilities as attack targets and organize perturbation candidates into a final perturbation sequence. Experimental results show that our attack method surpasses prevailing baselines in both attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.</description>

      <title>Disguised Copyright Infringement of Latent Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Copyright infringement may occur when a generative model produces samples substantially similar to some copyrighted data that it had access to during the training phase. The notion of access usually refers to including copyrighted samples directly in the training dataset, which one may inspect to identify an infringement. We argue that such visual auditing largely overlooks a concealed copyright infringement, where one constructs a disguise that looks drastically different from the copyrighted sample yet still induces the effect of training Latent Diffusion Models on it. Such disguises only require indirect access to the copyrighted material and cannot be visually distinguished, thus easily circumventing the current auditing tools. In this paper, we provide a better understanding of such disguised copyright infringement by uncovering the disguises generation algorithm, the revelation of the disguises, and importantly, how to detect them to augment the existing toolbox. Additionally, we introduce a broader notion of acknowledgment for comprehending such indirect access.</description>
