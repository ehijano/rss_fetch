      <title>Affine Deformations of Divisible Convex Cones and Affine Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ obtained by adding a translation part to a torsion-free discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})$ dividing a convex domain in the sense of Benoist, we construct two maximal convex domains on which the affine action of that subgroup is free and properly continuous. We also introduce a notion of "affine spacetime" structure, with which quotients of those domains are naturally endowed. In that setting, we show that those quotients are Maximal Globally Hyperbolic affine spacetimes admitting a locally uniformly Convex and Compact Cauchy surface (denoted as a MGHCC affine spacetimes), and that they come with a cosmological time function with Cauchy hypersurfaces foliating the quotient affine spacetime as level sets. Finally, we show that those are the only examples of such MGHCC affine spacetimes. All these results generalise the work of Mess, Barbot and Bonsante on affine deformations of uniform lattices of $\mathrm{SO}_0(d,1)$.</description>

      <title>Deformed Aeppli cohomology: canonical deformations and jumping formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex analytic family of complex manifolds, we consider canonical Aeppli deformations of $(p,q)$-forms and study its relations to the varying of dimension of the deformed Aeppli cohomology $\dim H^{\bullet,\bullet}_{A\phi(t)}(X)$. In particular, we prove the jumping formula for the deformed Aeppli cohomology $H^{\bullet,\bullet}_{A\phi(t)}(X)$. As a direct consequence, $\dim H^{p,q}_{A\phi(t)}(X)$ remains constant iff the Bott-Chern deformations of $(n-p,n-q)$-forms and the Aeppli deformations of $(n-p-1,n-q-1)$-forms are canonically unobstructed. Furthermore, the Bott-Chern/Aeppli deformations are shown to be unobstructed if some weak forms of $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma is satisfied.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an upper bound on the number of the page on which the spectral sequence corresponding to a locally free isometric action of an abelian Lie group degenerates. We give examples showing that these bounds are indeed sharp. Finally, we further justify the study of this sequence by exhibiting a potential application to the study of harmonic forms.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of Perelman's $\nu$-entropy of standard Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paul Schwahn recently exhibited 112 non-symmetric, connected, simply connected, compact Einstein manifolds that are stable with respect to the total scalar curvature functional restricted to the space of Riemannian metrics with constant scalar curvature and fixed volume. This stability follows from the inequality $\lambda_L &gt; 2E$, where $\lambda_L$ denotes the smallest eigenvalue of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on TT-tensors and $E$ is the corresponding Einstein factor.
  In this paper, we estimate the smallest positive eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for connected, simply connected, non-symmetric standard Einstein manifolds $(G/H,g_{\operatorname{st}})$ with $G$ a compact and connected simple Lie group. We obtain that $\lambda_1&gt;2E$ for all of them excepting $7$ spaces. As a consequence of our estimates, we establish that all stable Einstein manifolds found by Schwahn are in fact linear stable with respect to Perelman's $\nu$-entropy.</description>

      <title>The fundamental theorem of the local theory for non-smooth curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical fundamental theorem of the local theory of smooth curves to a wider class of non-smooth data. Curvature and torsion are prescribed in terms of the distributional derivative measures of two given functions of bounded variation. The essentially unique non-smooth curve solution has both finite total curvature and total absolute torsion. In case of continuous data, we preliminarly discuss a more general problem involving a linear system of distributional derivative equations.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity for minimizing hypersurfaces in dimension 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that area-minimizing hypersurfaces are generically smooth in ambient dimension $11$ in the context of the Plateau problem and of area minimization in integral homology. For higher ambient dimensions, $n+1 \geq 12$, we prove in the same two contexts that area-minimizing hypersurfaces have at most an $n-10-\epsilon_n$ dimensional singular set after an arbitrarily $C^\infty$-small perturbation of the Plateau boundary or the ambient Riemannian metric, respectively.</description>

      <title>Contact magnetic geodesic and sub-Riemannian flows on $V_{n,2}$ and integrable cases of a heavy rigid body with a gyrostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the integrability of magnetic geodesic flows of $SO(n)$--invariant Riemannian metrics on the rank two Stefel variety $V_{n,2}$ with respect to the magnetic field $\eta\, d\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the standard contact form on $V_{n,2}$ and $\eta$ is a real parameter. Also, we prove the integrability of magnetic sub-Riemannian geodesic flows for $SO(n)$-invariant sub-Riemannian structures on $V_{n,2}$. All statements in the limit $\eta=0$ imply the integrability of the problems without the influence of the magnetic field. We also consider integrable pendulum-type natural mechanical systems with the kinetic energy defined by $SO(n)\times SO(2)$--invariant Riemannian metrics. For $n=3$, using the isomorphism $V_{3,2}\cong SO(3)$, the obtained integrable magnetic models reduce to integrable cases of a motion of a heavy rigid body with a gyrostat around a fixed point: Zhukovskiy--Volterra gyrostat, the Lagrange top with a gyrostat, and the Kowalevski top with a gyrostat. As a by-product we obtain the Lax presentations for the Lagrange gyrostat and the Kowalevski gyrostat in the fixed reference frame (dual Lax representations).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion of the Gaussian Integral Operators on Riemannian submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaussian integral operator arises naturally as a local Euclidean approximation of the heat semigroup on a Riemannian manifold and plays a pivotal role in the analysis of graph Laplacians, particularly within the frameworks of manifold learning and spectral graph theory. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the Gaussian integral operator on a smooth Riemannian submanifold \( M \subset \mathbb{R}^n \), focusing on its expansion as \( \varepsilon \to 0^+ \). Under the assumption that the input function is real analytic near a fixed point \( x \in M \), we derive a full asymptotic expansion of the operator and compute the first-order correction term explicitly in terms of the mean curvature vector and the scalar curvature of the submanifold. In particular, we apply our results to hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and investigate geometric conditions under which points exhibit \emph{equicurvature}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new isolation and stability results for Einstein manifolds in a variety of settings. Imposing conditions on the Weyl tensor, we establish new stability criteria for compact, asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) and asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) manifolds and an isolation result in the latter setting. For compact K\"ahler and Sasaki $\eta$-Einstein manifolds, we provide similar results which involve the Bochner tensor and the contact Bochner tensor, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We give a modern account of the classical theory of Bianchi \cite{Bia03} (see also \cite{KamPedPin98}) relating isothermic surfaces to Bonnet pairs.

      <title>A Holomorphic Splitting Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-term project is to construct a complete Calabi-Yau metric on the complement of the anticanonical divisor in a compact K\"ahler manifold $\oM$. We focus on the case where this smooth divisor has multiplicity 2 and is itself a compact Calabi-Yau manifold. Firstly we solved the Monge-Amp\`ere equation when the Ricci potiential is of $O(r^{-1})$ decay on the generalized $ALG$ manifolds. Then we used the solution to this K\"ahler Ricci flat metric to prove a holomorphic splitting theorem: If $K_{\oM}=\calo(-2D)$, where $D$ can be realized as a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold, and if $\calo_{3D}(D)$ is trivial, then this K\"ahler manifold $\oM$ is biholomorphic to $\bbp^1\times D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,J)$ be a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$. A $p$-K\"ahler structure on $(M,J)$ is a real, closed $(p,p)$-transverse form. In this paper, we address the conjecture of L. Alessandrini and G. Bassanelli on $(n-2)$-K\"ahler nilmanifolds equipped with nilpotent complex structures and holomorphically parallelizable nilmanifolds. We also derive necessary conditions for the existence of smooth curves of $p$-K\"ahler structures, starting from a fixed $p$-K\"ahler structure, along a differentiable family of compact complex manifolds. In addition, we study the cohomology classes of $p$-K\"ahler (resp. $p$-symplectic, $p$-pluriclosed) structures on compact complex manifolds. We provide several examples of families of compact complex manifolds admitting $p$-K\"ahler or $p$-symplectic structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric Convergence to an Extreme Limit Space with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2014, Gromov conjectured that sequences of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature should have subsequences which converge in some geometric sense to limit spaces with some notion of generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. In recent joint work with Changliang Wang, the authors found a sequence of warped product Riemannian metrics on $\Sph^2\times \Sph^1$ with nonnegative scalar curvature whose metric tensors converge in the $W^{1,p}$ sense for $p&lt;2$ to an extreme warped product limit space where the warping function hits infinity at two points. Here we study this extreme limit space as a metric space and as an integral current space and prove the sequence converges in the volume preserving intrinsic flat and measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense to this space. This limit space may now be used to test any proposed definitions for generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. One does not need expertise in Geometric Measure Theory or in Intrinsic Flat Convergence to read this paper.</description>

      <title>The Rigidity of Constraint: A Spencer-Hodge Theoretic Approach to the Hodge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new theoretical perspective for studying the Hodge conjecture through an analytical framework based on constraint geometry. Our theory begins with a key observation: in compatible pair Spencer theory, a "differential degeneration" mechanism simplifies Spencer differential operators to classical exterior differential under specific algebraic conditions, bridging constraint geometry and de Rham cohomology. This bridge alone is insufficient to filter rare Hodge classes with algebraicity. We introduce the core concept -- "Spencer hyper-constraint conditions," a constraint system from Lie algebraic internal symmetry integrating: differential degeneration, Cartan subalgebra constraints, and mirror stability. This constraint principle filters geometric objects with excellent properties from degenerate classes, constructively defined as "Spencer-Hodge classes." To reveal their geometric significance, we "complex geometrize" the framework, integrating with Variation of Hodge Structures theory to construct Spencer-VHS theory. We establish connections between Spencer hyper-constraint conditions and flatness of corresponding sections under Spencer-Gauss-Manin connections. With the "Spencer-calibration equivalence principle" and "dimension matching strong hypothesis," flatness directly corresponds to algebraicity, providing sufficient conditions for verifying the Hodge conjecture. This forms "Spencer-Hodge verification criteria," transforming the proof problem into investigating whether three structured conditions hold: geometric realization of Spencer theory, satisfaction of algebraic-dimensional control, and establishment of the Spencer-calibration equivalence principle. This framework provides new perspectives for understanding this fundamental problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Finite entropy translating solitons in slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study translating solitons for the mean curvature flow, $\Sigma^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ which are contained in slabs, and are of finite genus and finite entropy. As a first consequence of our results, we can enumerate connected components of slices to define asymptotic invariants $\omega^\pm(\Sigma)\in\mathbb{N}$, which count the numbers of "wings''. Analyzing these, we give a method for computing the entropies $\lambda(\Sigma)$ via a simple formula involving the wing numbers, which in particular shows that for this class of solitons the entropy is quantized into integer steps. Finally, combining the concept of wing numbers with Morse theory for minimal surfaces, we prove the uniqueness theorem that if $\Sigma$ is a complete embedded simply connected translating soliton contained in a slab with entropy $\lambda(\Sigma)=3$ and containing a vertical line, then $\Sigma$ is one of the translating pitchforks of Hoffman-Mart\'in-White</description>

      <title>Critical metrics of eigenvalue functionals via Clarke subdifferential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a new framework to study critical points of functionals defined as combinations of eigenvalues of operators with respect to a given set of parameters: Riemannian metrics, potentials, etc. Our setting builds upon Clarke's differentiation theory to provide a novel understanding of critical metrics. In particular, we unify and refine previous research carried out on Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues. We also use our theory to tackle original examples such as the conformal GJMS operators, the conformal Laplacian, and the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces from initial data set symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\tilde{\Sigma},h_{ab},K_{ab})$ be an initial data set and let $x^a$ be a symmetry vector of $\tilde{\Sigma}$. Consider a MOTS $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$ and let the symmetry vector be decomposable along the unit normal to $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$, and along $\mathcal{S}$. In this note we present some basic results with regards to the stability of $\mathcal{S}$. The vector decomposition allows us to characterize the instability of $\mathcal{S}$ by the nature of the zero set of the normal component to $\mathcal{S}$ and the divergence of the component along $\mathcal{S}$. Further observations are made under the assumption of $\mathcal{S}$ having a constant mean curvature, and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ being an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Existence of Minimal Surfaces in Infinite Volume Hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of embedded minimal surfaces in non-compact 3-manifolds remains a largely unresolved and challenging problem in geometry. In this paper, we address several open cases regarding the existence of finite-area, embedded, complete, minimal surfaces in infinite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
  Among other results, for doubly degenerate manifolds with bounded geometry, we prove a dichotomy: either every such manifold contains a closed minimal surface or there exists such a manifold admitting a foliation by closed minimal surfaces. We also construct the first examples of Schottky manifolds with closed minimal surfaces and demonstrate the existence of Schottky manifolds containing infinitely many closed minimal surfaces. Lastly, for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with rank-1 cusps, we show that a broad class of these manifolds must contain a finite-area, embedded, complete minimal surface.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Varieties of Small Codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that $X$ is a complete intersection provided that $n \geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>

      <title>Sections of Lagrangian fibrations on holomorphic symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called ``a Tate-Shafarevich twist'') is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the general fiber of the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ is primitive (that is, not divisible) in integer homology. We also assume that $\pi$ has reduced fibers in codimension 1. Then $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a punctured Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric that equals the Poincar\'e metric near the punctures, and a holomorphic line bundle that polarizes the metric. We show that the quotient of the induced Fubini-Study forms by Kodaira maps of high tensor powers of the line bundle and the Poincar\'e form near the singularity grows polynomially uniformly on a neighborhood of the singularity as the tensor power tends to infinity, as an application of the method in [5].</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Normal Form Power Series for Infinite-Dimensional Lie Pseudo-Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <title>Positivity of simplicial volume for closed nonpositively curved four-manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>
