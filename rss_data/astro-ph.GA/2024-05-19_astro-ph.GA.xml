      <title>Inferring the Distribution of the Ionising Photon Escape Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies ($f_\mathrm{esc}$) is a key parameter for understanding how intergalactic hydrogen became reionised, but it remains mostly unconstrained. Measurements have been limited to the average value in galaxy ensembles and handfuls of individual detections. To help understand which mechanisms govern ionising photon escape, here we infer the distribution of $f_\mathrm{esc}$. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian inference technique to estimate the population distribution of $f_\mathrm{esc}$ from the ratio of Lyman Continuum to non-ionising UV flux measured from broadband photometry. We apply it to a sample of 148 z ~ 3.5 star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. We explore four physically motivated distributions: constant, log-normal, exponential and bimodal, recovering $\langle f_\mathrm{esc} \rangle \approx5\%$ for most models. We find the observations are best described by an exponential $f_\mathrm{esc}$ distribution with scale factor $\mu=0.05^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. This indicates most galaxies in our sample exhibit very low escape fractions while predicting substantial ionising photon leakage for only a few galaxies, implying a range of optical depths in the ISM and/or time variability in ionising photon escape. We rule out a bimodal distribution at high significance, indicating that a purely bimodal model of ionising photon escape (due to very strong sightline and/or time variability) is not favoured. We compare our recovered exponential distribution with the SPHINX simulations and find that, while the simulation also predicts an exponential-like distribution, it significantly underpredicts our inferred mean. The distribution of $f_\mathrm{esc}$ can be a vital test for simulations in understanding ionising photon leakage and is important to consider to gain a complete picture of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Positive AGN Feedback on the Properties of Galaxies in a Semi-Analytic Model of Galaxy Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model FEGA (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies), which incorporates updated prescriptions for key physical processes in galaxy formation. Notably, FEGA features an unprecedented semi-analytic modeling of positive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. The model combines the latest prescriptions for gas infall and cooling, a revised star formation recipe that incorporates the extended Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, disk instability, updated supernovae feedback, reincorporation of ejected gas, hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies, and the formation of diffuse light. A novel description of AGN feedback is introduced, describing the positive mode as a burst of star formation from a cooling gas fraction. FEGA is rigorously calibrated using an MCMC procedure to match the evolution of the stellar mass and K-band luminosity functions from high redshift to the present, and the local black hole-bulge mass relation. Subsequently, the model is tested against several observed and predicted scaling relations, including the star formation rate-mass, black hole-bulge and stellar mass, stellar-to-halo mass, and red fraction-mass relations. Additionally, we test FEGA against other galaxy properties such as the distribution of specific star formation rates, stellar metallicity and morphology. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of positive AGN feedback can co-exist with its negative counterpart without drastic alterations to other prescriptions. Importantly, this inclusion improves the ability of the model to describe the primary scaling relations observed in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Instability of Circumnuclear Gas Supply as An Origin of "Changing-look" Phenomenon of Supermassive Blackholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the "Changing-look" (CL) phenomenon in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open issue. This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic time scale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN's disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic time scale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.</description>

      <title>Cross-method analysis of co-rotation radii dataset for spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A co-rotation radius is a key characteristic of disc galaxies that is essential to determine the angular speed of the spiral structure $\Omega_{p}$, and therefore understand its nature. In the literature, there are plenty of methods to estimate this value, but do these measurements have any consistency? In this work, we collected a dataset of corotation radius measurements for 547 galaxies, 300 of which had at least two values. An initial analysis reveals that most objects have rather inconsistent corotation radius positions. Moreover, a significant fraction of galactic discs is distinguished by a large error coverage and almost uniform distribution of measurements. These findings do not have any relation to spiral type, Hubble classification, or presence of a bar. Among other reasons, obtained results could be explained by the transient nature of spirals in a considerable part of galaxies. We have made our collected data sample publicly available, and have demonstrated on one example how it could be useful for future research by investigating a winding time value for a sample of galaxies with possible multiple spiral arm patterns.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas kinematics in local early-type galaxies with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local early-type galaxies (ETGs) are mostly populated by old stars, with little or no recent star formation activity. For this reason, they have historically been believed to be essentially devoid of cold gas, that is the fuel for the formation of new stars. Over the past two decades, however, increasingly-sensitive instrumentation observing the sky at (sub-)mm wavelengths has revealed the presence of significant amounts of cold molecular gas in the hearts of nearby ETGs. The unprecedented capabilities offered by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in particular, have allowed us to obtain snapshots of the central regions of these ETGs with unprecedented detail, mapping this gas with higher sensitivity and resolution than ever possible before. Studies of the kinematics of the observed cold gas reservoirs are crucial for galaxy formation and evolution theories, providing - e.g. - constraints on the fundamental properties and fuelling/feedback processes of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centre of these galaxies. In this brief review, we summarise what the first ten years of ALMA observations have taught us about the distribution and kinematics of the cold molecular gas component in nearby ellipticals and lenticulars.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes are growing slowly by $z\sim5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the black hole mass function at $z\sim5$ using XQz5, our recent sample of the most luminous quasars between the redshifts $4.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.3$. We include 72 quasars with black hole masses estimated from velocity-broadened emission-line measurements and single-epoch virial prescriptions in the footprint of a highly complete parent survey. The sample mean Eddington ratio and standard deviation is $\log\lambda \approx -0.20\pm0.24$. The completeness-corrected mass function is modelled as a double power-law, and we constrain its evolution across redshift assuming accretion-dominated mass growth. We estimate the evolution of the mass function from $z=5-4$, presenting joint constraints on accretion properties through a measured dimensionless e-folding parameter, $k_{\rm{ef}} \equiv \langle\lambda\rangle U (1-\epsilon)/\epsilon = 1.79\pm0.06$, where $\langle\lambda\rangle$ is the mean Eddington ratio, $U$ is the duty cycle, and $\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency. If these supermassive black holes were to form from seeds smaller than $10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the growth rate must have been considerably faster at $z\gg5$ than observed from $z=5-4$. A growth rate exceeding $3\times$ the observed rate would reduce the initial heavy seed mass to $10^{5-6}\,M_{\odot}$, aligning with supermassive star and/or direct collapse seed masses. Stellar mass ($10^2\,M_{\odot}$) black hole seeds would require $\gtrsim4.5\times$ the observed growth rate at $z\gg5$ to reproduce the measured active black hole mass function. A possible pathway to produce the most extreme quasars is radiatively inefficient accretion flow, suggesting black holes with low angular momentum or photon trapping in supercritically accreting thick discs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Stellar-to-Dynamical Mass Relation II. Peculiar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical correlations connecting starlight to galaxy dynamics (e.g., the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical/quiescent galaxies and the Tully--Fisher relation of spiral/star-forming galaxies) provide cosmology-independent distance estimation and are central to local Universe cosmology. In this work, we introduce the mass hyperplane (MH), which is the stellar-to-dynamical mass relation $(M_\star/M_\mathrm{dyn})$ recast as a linear distance indicator. Building on recent FP studies, we show that both star-forming and quiescent galaxies follow the same empirical MH, then use this to measure the peculiar velocities (PVs) for a sample of 2496 galaxies at $z&lt;0.12$ from GAMA. The limiting precision of MH-derived distance/PV estimates is set by the intrinsic scatter in size, which we find to be $\approx$0.1~dex for both quiescent and star-forming galaxies (when modeled independently) and $\approx$0.11~dex when all galaxies are modeled together; showing that the MH is as good as the FP. To empirically validate our framework and distance/PV estimates, we compare the inferred distances to groups as derived using either quiescent or star-forming galaxies. A good agreement is obtained with no discernible bias or offset, having a scatter of $\approx$0.05~dex $\approx$12\% in distance. Further, we compare our PV measurements for the quiescent galaxies to the previous PV measurements of the galaxies in common between GAMA and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which shows similarly good agreement. Finally, we provide comparisons of PV measurements made with the FP and the MH, then discuss possible improvements in the context of upcoming surveys such as the 4MOST Hemisphere Survey (4HS).</description>

      <title>UVCANDELS: The role of dust on the stellar mass$-$size relation of disk galaxies at 0.5 $\leq z \leq$ 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields (UVCANDELS) to measure half-light radii in the rest-frame far-UV for $\sim$16,000 disk-like galaxies over $0.5\leq z \leq 3$. We compare these results to rest-frame optical sizes that we measure in a self-consistent way and find that the stellar mass-size relation of disk galaxies is steeper in the rest-frame UV than in the optical across our entire redshift range. We show that this is mainly driven by massive galaxies ($\gtrsim10^{10}$M$_\odot$), which we find to also be among the most dusty. Our results are consistent with the literature and have commonly been interpreted as evidence of inside-out growth wherein galaxies form their central structures first. However, they could also suggest that the centers of massive galaxies are more heavily attenuated than their outskirts. We distinguish between these scenarios by modeling and selecting galaxies at $z=2$ from the VELA simulations suite in a way that is consistent with UVCANDELS. We show that the effects of dust alone can account for the size differences we measure at $z=2$. This indicates that, at different wavelengths, size differences and the different slopes of the stellar mass-size relation do not constitute evidence for inside-out growth.</description>

      <title>A hide-and-seek game: Looking for Population III stars during the Epoch of Reionization through the HeII$\lambda$1640 line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas surrounding first-generation (Pop III) stars is expected to emit a distinct signature in the form of the HeII recombination line at 1640~\AA (HeII$\lambda$1640). Here we explore the challenges and opportunities in identifying this elusive stellar population via the HeII$\lambda$1640 in $M_\star &gt; 10^{7.5} ~ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, $z \simeq 6 - 10$), using JWST/NIRSpec. With this aim in mind, we combine cosmological dustyGadget simulations with analytical modeling of the intrinsic HeII emission. While tentative candidates with bright HeII emission like GN-z11 have been proposed in the literature, the prevalence of such bright systems remains unclear due to significant uncertainties involved in the prediction of the HeII luminosity. In fact, similar Pop III clumps might be almost two orders of magnitude fainter depending on the underlying Pop III model (e.g., with/without stellar mass loss and/or assuming different Pop III-formation efficiencies in star-forming clouds). Moreover, up to $\sim 90 \%$ of these clumps might be missed with NIRSpec/MOS due to the limited FoV, while this problem appears to be less severe with NIRSpec/IFU. We propose deep spectroscopy targeting potential peripheral Pop III clumps around bright, massive galaxies as a promising approach to achieve a clear detection of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Distribution functions for the modelling of accretion remnants in Milky Way-like galaxies: insights from IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study accretion remnants around Milky Way analogs in the IllustrisTNG simulations to determine how well commonly used distribution functions (DFs) describe their phase-space distributions. We identify 30 Milky Way analogs and 116 remnants from mergers with stellar mass ratios greater than 1:20. Two-power density profiles, as well as rotating constant-anisotropy and Osipkov-Merritt DFs are fit to the remnants. We determine that the remnants are suitable for equilibrium modelling by assessing them in the context of the Jeans equation. Each of the models we consider are reasonably able to fit the stellar remnant energy and angular momentum distribution, as well as the magnitude and shape of velocity dispersion profiles. Case studies matched to two well-known merger remnants in the stellar halo-Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) and Sequoia-are explored in more depth. We find good evidence that remnants with high anisotropy $\beta$, such as GS/E, are better modelled with a superposition of two Osipkov-Merritt DFs than either a constant-anisotropy model or a single Osipkov-Merritt DF. We estimate an Osipkov-Merritt profile with scale radius between 2-4 kpc would be a good first-order representation of GS/E, and comment on existing observational evidence for this as well as studies which could demonstrate it. Overall, we find that DF-based models work well for describing the kinematics of large merger remnants. Our results will be an important reference for future studies which seek to constrain both the spatial and kinematic properties of merger remnants in the Milky Way stellar halo.</description>

      <title>Chemistry across dust and gas gaps in protoplanetary disks: modelling the co-spatial molecular rings in the HD 100546 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution observations show that typically both the dust and the gas in nearby extended protoplanetary disks are structured, possibly related to radial and azimuthal variations in the disk density and/or chemistry. The aim of this work is to identify the expected location and intensity of rings seen in molecular line emission of HCN, CN, C$_2$H, NO, [CI], and HCO$^+$ in gapped disks while exploring a range of physical conditions across the gap. In particular, we model HD 100546 disk where molecular rings are co-spatial with the dust rings at $\sim$20 and $\sim$200 au, in contrast to most other gapped disks. The fiducial model of a gapped disk with a 15 au gas cavity, a 20 au dust cavity, and a shallow (a factor of $\lesssim10$) gas and deep dust gap at 40-175 au provides a good fit to the continuum, CO isotopologues, HCN, and HCO$^+$ in the HD 100546 disk. However, the predictions for [CI], CN, C$_2$H and NO do not match the intensity nor the morphology of the observations. An exploration of the parameter space shows that in general the molecular emission rings are only co-spatial with the dust rings if the gas gap between the dust rings is depleted by at least four orders of magnitude in gas or if the C/O ratio of the gas is varying as a function of radius. For shallower gaps the decrease in the UV field roughly balances the effect of a higher gas density for UV tracers such as CN, C$_2$H, and NO. Therefore, these radicals are not good tracers of the gas gap depth. The C/O ratio primarily effects the intensity of the lines without changing the morphology much. The co-spatial rings observed in the HD 100546 disk could be indicative of a radially varying C/O ratio in the HD 100546 disk with a C/O above 1 in a narrow region across the dust rings, together with a shallow gas gap that is depleted by a factor of $\sim$10 in gas, and a reduced background UV field.</description>

      <title>A kinematic origin of the white dwarfs in the Solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent space-borne mission Gaia, there is a nearly complete sample of white dwarfs up to about 100 parsecs from the Sun, which may have very diverse origins. We aim to compute the Galactic orbits for white dwarfs observed in our Solar neighborhood, in order to analyze the most probable regions of the Galaxy where they could have formed, the distribution of their orbital parameters, as well as the observational biases introduced when constructing the local sample. We used a detailed Galactic orbit integration package, in conjunction with a detailed population synthesis code specifically designed to replicate the different Galactic components of the white dwarf population. Synthetic stars are generated based on the current observational sample, and subsequently, their orbital integration allows for the reconstruction of the population past history. Our kinematic analysis reveals that the majority of thin disk, thick disk, and halo white dwarfs will have left our 100 pc neighborhood in approximately 3.30, 1.05, and 0.6 Myr, respectively. The spatial distribution of the integrated thin disk orbits suggests that 68 percent of these stars were formed at less than 1 kpc from the Sun, while most of thick disk members suffered from radial disk migration. The local halo white dwarfs typically belong to the "inner halo", being their orbits mostly planar and not extending beyond R = 20-25 kpc. Despite the observational bias, the distribution of orbital parameters is well represented by the observed sample. The Solar neighborhood is a transitory concept, which must be taken into account when analyzing the overall properties of such a population, such as its age distribution, metallicities or formation history. Even so, the kinematic properties observed by recent missions such as Gaia are representative of the total population up to a distance of approximately 500 pc [abridged].</description>

The existence of such a rotating component is relevant to the estimation of the mass of the galaxy, and therefore the question of whether NGC 1052-DF4 is truly deficient of dark matter, similar to NGC 1052-DF2 another galaxy in the same group. The rotational characteristics of seven globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF4 were investigated, finding that a non-rotating kinematic model has a higher Bayesian evidence than a rotating model, by a factor of approximately 2.5. In addition, we find that under the assumption of rotation, its amplitude must be small. This distinct lack of rotation strengthens the case that, based on its intrinsic velocity dispersion, NGC 1052-DF4 is a truly dark matter deficient galaxy.</description>

      <title>Sloshing Cold Fronts in Galaxy Cluster Abell 2566</title>

Abstract: This paper presents properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the environment of a cool core cluster Abell 2566 (redshift $z$ = 0.08247) based on the analysis of 20 ks Chandra X-ray data. 2D imaging analysis of the Chandra data from this cluster revealed spiral structures in the morphology of X-ray emission from within the central 109 kpc formed due to gas sloshing. This analysis also witness sharp edges in the surface brightness distribution along the south-east and north-west of the X-ray peaks at 41.6 kpc and 77.4 kpc, respectively. Spectral analysis of 0.5 - 7 keV X-ray photons along these discontinuities exhibited sharp temperature jumps from 2.3 to 3.1 keV and 1.8 to 2.8 keV, respectively, with consistency in the pressure profiles, implying their association with cold fronts due to gas sloshing of the gas. Further confirmation for such an association was provided by the deprojected broken power-law density function fit to the surface brightness distribution along these wedge shaped sectorial regions. This study also witness an offset of 4.6 arcsec (6.8 kpc) between the BCG and the X-ray peak, and interaction of the BCG with a sub-system in the central region, pointing towards the origin of the spiral structure due to a minor merger.</description>

      <title>Changing Look of the optical spectrum of the MeV Blazar PKS 0446+112 (4FGL J0449.1+1121)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the high activity of the gamma-ray Fermi source 4FGL J0449.1+1121 (PKS 0446+112), possibly associated with a IceCube neutrino event IC-240105A, we obtained optical spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the counterpart. We detect a clear emission line at 3830 Ang identified as Ly$\alpha$ that confirms the redshift of source at z=2.153. Comparing with previous spectroscopy, we find an increase of the continuum by a factor $\sim$10, and a significant decrease of the CIV 1550 emission line flux by a factor $\sim$5. This produces a dramatic drop of the Equivalent Width from $\sim$20 Ang to 0.8 Ang, which is suggestive of a very high jet activity. The Full Width Half Maximum of the emission lines are midway (1000 - 2000 km/s) between those typical of the broad and narrow regions of quasars. Based on this, the source classification is intermediate between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar and BL Lac object.</description>

      <title>Stellar Atmospheric Parameters From Gaia BP/RP Spectra using Uncertain Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the plentiful information available in the Gaia BP/RP spectra, there is significant scope for applying discriminative models to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances. We describe an approach to leverage an `Uncertain Neural Network' model trained on APOGEE data to provide high-quality predictions with robust estimates for per-prediction uncertainty. We report median formal uncertainties of 0.068 dex, 69.1K, 0.14 dex, 0.031 dex, 0.040 dex, and 0.029 dex for [Fe/H], $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [$\alpha$/M] respectively. We validate these predictions against our APOGEE training data, LAMOST, and Gaia GSP-Phot stellar parameters, and see a strong correlation between our predicted parameters and those derived from these surveys. We investigate the information content of the spectra by considering the `attention' our model pays to different spectral features compared to expectations from synthetic spectra calculations. Our model's predictions are applied to the Gaia dataset, and we produce a publicly available catalogue of our model's predictions.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Framework for Analyzing Galaxy Image Data by Implanting Human-in-the-loop on a Large Vision Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of astronomical datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity for humans to gain insight into the Universe. However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.</description>

      <title>The unluckiest star: A spectroscopically confirmed repeated partial tidal disruption event AT 2022dbl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unluckiest star orbits a supermassive black hole elliptically. Every time it reaches the pericenter, it shallowly enters the tidal radius and gets partially tidal disrupted, producing a series of flares. Confirmation of a repeated partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) requires not only evidence to rule out other types of transients, but also proof that only one star is involved, as TDEs from multiple stars can also produce similar flares. In this letter, we report the discovery of a repeated pTDE, AT 2022dbl. In a quiescent galaxy at z=0.0284, two separate optical/UV flares have been observed in 2022 and 2024, with no bright X-ray, radio or mid-infrared counterparts. Compared to the first flare, the second flare has a similar blackbody temperature of ~26,000 K, slightly lower peak luminosity, and slower rise and fall phases. Compared to the ZTF TDEs, their blackbody parameters, bolometric energies and light curve shapes are all similar. The spectra taken during the second flare show a steeper continuum than the late-time spectra of the previous flare, consistent with a newly risen flare. More importantly, the possibility of two independent TDEs can be largely ruled out because the optical spectra taken around the peak of the two flares exhibit highly similar broad Balmer, N III and possible He II emission lines, especially the extreme ~4100{\AA} emission lines. This represents the first robust spectroscopic evidence for a repeated pTDE, which can soon be verified by observing the third flare, given its short orbital period.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Galaxy Formation and Dark Matter Constraints from Dwarf Galaxy Surveys</title>

Abstract: The abundance of faint dwarf galaxies is determined by the underlying population of low-mass dark matter (DM) halos and the efficiency of galaxy formation in these systems. Here, we quantify potential galaxy formation and DM constraints from future dwarf satellite galaxy surveys. We generate satellite populations using a suite of Milky Way (MW)--mass cosmological zoom-in simulations and an empirical galaxy--halo connection model, and assess sensitivity to galaxy formation and DM signals when marginalizing over galaxy--halo connection uncertainties. We find that a survey of all satellites around one MW-mass host can constrain a galaxy formation cutoff at peak virial masses of $M_{50}=10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ at the $1\sigma$ level; however, a tail toward low $M_{50}$ prevents a $2\sigma$ measurement. In this scenario, combining hosts with differing bright satellite abundances significantly reduces uncertainties on $M_{50}$ at the $1\sigma$ level, but the $2\sigma$ tail toward low $M_{50}$ persists. We project that observations of one (two) complete satellite populations can constrain warm DM models with $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\approx 10~\mathrm{keV}$ ($20~\mathrm{keV}$). Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression can be constrained to $\approx 70\%$, $60\%$, and $50\%$ that in cold dark matter (CDM) at peak virial masses of $10^8$, $10^9$, and $10^{10}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, respectively; SHMF enhancement constraints are weaker ($\approx 20$, $4$, and $2$ times that in CDM, respectively) due to galaxy--halo connection degeneracies. These results motivate searches for faint dwarf galaxies beyond the MW and indicate that ongoing missions like Euclid and upcoming facilities including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe new galaxy formation and DM physics.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and polarization-dependent lensing of gravitational waves in strong gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation of gravitational waves can be described in terms of null geodesics by using the geometrical optics approximation. However, at large but finite frequencies the propagation is affected by the spin-orbit coupling corrections to geometrical optics, known as the gravitational spin Hall effect. Consequently, gravitational waves follow slightly different frequency- and polarization-dependent trajectories, leading to dispersive and birefringent phenomena. We study the potential for detecting the gravitational spin Hall effect in hierarchical triple black hole systems, consisting of an emitting binary orbiting a more massive body acting as a gravitational lens. We calculate the difference in time of arrival with respect to the geodesic propagation and find that it follows a simple power-law dependence on frequency with a fixed exponent. We calculate the gravitational spin Hall-corrected waveform and its mismatch with respect to the original waveform. The waveform carries a measurable imprint of the strong gravitational field if the source, lens, and observer are sufficiently aligned, or for generic observers if the source is close enough to the lens. We present constraints on dispersive time delays from GWTC-3, translated from limits on Lorentz invariance violation. Finally, we address the sensitivity of current and future ground detectors to dispersive lensing. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational spin Hall effect can be detected, providing a novel probe of general relativity and the environments of compact binary systems.</description>

      <title>On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the linear stability of selfinteracting boson stars in the nonrelativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. For this purpose, based on a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we determine the behavior of general linear perturbations around the stationary and spherically symmetric solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson system. In particular, we conclude that ground state configurations are linearly stable if the selfinteraction is repulsive, whereas there exist a state of maximum mass that divides the stable and the unstable branches in case the selfinteraction is attractive. Regarding the excited states, they are in general unstable under generic perturbations, although we identify a stability band in the first excited states of the repulsive theory. This result is independent of the mass of the scalar field and the details of the selfinteraction potential, and it is in contrast to the situation of vanishing selfinteraction, in which excited states are always unstable.</description>
