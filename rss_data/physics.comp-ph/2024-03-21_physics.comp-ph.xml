      <title>Thermal Conductivity Calculation using Homogeneous Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation with Allegro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the heat flux formula for the Allegro model, one of machine-learning interatomic potentials using the equivariant deep neural network, to calculate lattice thermal conductivity using the homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method based on the Green-Kubo formula. Allegro can construct more advanced atomic descriptors than conventional ones, and can be applied to multicomponent and large-scale systems, providing a significant advantage in estimating the thermal conductivity of anharmonic materials, such as thermoelectric materials. In addition, the spectral heat current (SHC) method, recently developed for the HNEMD framework (HNEMD-SHC), allows the calculation of not only the total thermal conductivity but also its frequency components. The verification of the heat flux and the demonstration of HNEMD-SHC method are performed for the extremely anharmonic low-temperature phase of Ag$_2$Se.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced band gap renormalization by dielectric dependent global hybrid density functional tight-binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electronic bandstructures of solids are indispensable for a wide variety of applications and should provide a sound prediction of phonon-induced band gap renormalization at finite temperatures. We employ our previously introduced formalism of general hybrid functionals within the approximate density functional method, DFTB, to present first insights into the accuracy of temperature dependent band gaps obtained by a dielectric-dependent global hybrid functional. The work targets the prototypical group-IV semiconductors diamond and silicon. Following Zacharias et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 177401 (2015)], we sample the nuclear wave function by stochastic Monte-Carlo integration as well as the deterministic one-shot procedure [Phys. Rev. B 94, 075125 (2016)] derived from it. The computational efficiency of DFTB enables us to further compare these approaches, which fully take nuclear quantum effects into account, with classical Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic (BOMD) simulations. While the quantum mechanical treatments of Zacharias et al. yield band gaps in good agreement with experiment, calculations based on BOMD snapshots inadequately describe the renormalization effect at low temperatures. We demonstrate the importance of properly incorporating nuclear quantum effects by adapting the stochastic approach to normal amplitudes that arise from the classical equipartition principle. For low temperatures the results thus obtained closely resemble the BOMD predictions, while anharmonic effects become important beyond $500\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparisons between DFTB parametrized from semi-local DFT, and global hybrid DFTB, suggest that Fock-type exchange systematically yields a slightly more pronounced electron-phonon interaction, hence stronger gap renormalization and zero-point corrections.</description>

      <title>Incorrect Resonance Escape Probability in Monte Carlo Codes due to the Threshold Approximation of Temperature-Dependent Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo-transport codes are designed to simulate the complex neutron transport physics associated with nuclear systems. These codes are tasked with simulating phenomena such as temperature effects on cross-sections, thermo-physical effects, reaction rates, and kinematics. It is not computationally possible to simulate the physics of a system exactly. However, many of the approximations made by modern simulation codes have been well validated. This article investigates an impactful simulation error caused by an approximation made in many Monte Carlo-transport codes. The approximation that target-at-rest is valid for neutrons at energies 400 times that of the thermal energy of the target particle is found to be inaccurate in certain scenarios. This paper identifies such cases, notably TRISO [1] fuel and instances where fuel infiltrates the pores of graphite in Molten Salt Reactors. The breakdown of this approximation occurs particularly when there exists a small length scale between fuel, a material with absorption resonances, and moderator, a scattering material. When threshold values are too small, resonance escape probabilities can deviate by as much as 1% per resonance, forming a baseline defect. Furthermore, two distinct anomalies were observed upon temperature variation, directly attributed to the transition between target-at-rest and target-in-motion physics. Equations provided in this study offer predictions for the temperature ranges within which these anomalies occur, based on system temperature and threshold value. The recommendations put forth in this paper advocate for incorporating the threshold value as a user-defined variable in transport Monte Carlo codes employing this approximation. Additionally, users are advised to conduct convergence studies to ensure that the chosen threshold value is sufficiently high to mitigate the influence of baseline defects and anomalies.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Temperature Effects for Ionic Conductivity in Li6PS5Cl</title>

Abstract: Ensuring solid-state lithium batteries perform well across a wide temperature range is crucial for their practical use. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of the battery materials, however, the high computational cost of ab initio MD poses challenges for simulating ion migration dynamics at low temperatures. To address this issue, accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials were trained, which enable efficient and reliable simulations of the ionic diffusion processes in Li6PS5Cl over a large temperature range for long-time evolution. Our study revealed the significant impact of subtle lattice parameter variations on Li+ diffusion at low temperatures and identified the increasing influence of surface contributions as the temperature decreases. Our findings elucidate the factors influencing low temperature performance and present strategic guidance towards improving the performance of solid-state lithium batteries under these conditions.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for anisotropic crystal growth on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. Our numerical method can be employed both situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is the most relevant characteristic of systems of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized equation that embeds all of them.</description>

      <title>Scalable Implicit Solvers with Dynamic Mesh Adaptation for a Relativistic Drift-Kinetic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a relativistic drift-kinetic model for runaway electrons along with a Fokker-Planck operator for small-angle Coulomb collisions, a radiation damping operator, and a secondary knock-on (Boltzmann) collision source. We develop a new scalable fully implicit solver utilizing finite volume and conservative finite difference schemes and dynamic mesh adaptivity. A new data management framework in the PETSc library based on the p4est library is developed to enable simulations with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), distributed memory parallelization, and dynamic load balancing of computational work. This framework and the runaway electron solver building on the framework are able to dynamically capture both bulk Maxwellian at the low-energy region and a runaway tail at the high-energy region. To effectively capture features via the AMR algorithm, a new AMR indicator prediction strategy is proposed that is performed alongside the implicit time evolution of the solution. This strategy is complemented by the introduction of computationally cheap feature-based AMR indicators that are analyzed theoretically. Numerical results quantify the advantages of the prediction strategy in better capturing features compared with nonpredictive strategies; and we demonstrate trade-offs regarding computational costs. The robustness with respect to model parameters, algorithmic scalability, and parallel scalability are demonstrated through several benchmark problems including manufactured solutions and solutions of different physics models. We focus on demonstrating the advantages of using implicit time stepping and AMR for runaway electron simulations.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Methods for Multi-Block Optimization Problems over Transport Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes, which underlie various applications including strongly correlated quantum physics and machine learning. Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>WyCryst: Wyckoff Inorganic Crystal Generator Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative design marks a significant data-driven advancement in the exploration of novel inorganic materials, which entails learning the symmetry equivalent to the crystal structure prediction (CSP) task and subsequent learning of their target properties. Generative models have been developed in the last few years that use custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models. While periodicity and global Euclidian symmetry in three dimensions through translations, rotations and reflections have recently been accounted for, symmetry constraints within allowed space groups have not. This is especially important because the final step involves energy relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the relaxed crystal structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). To address this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst), composed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic crystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated DFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates materials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by encoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully reproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and 221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both ground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database (Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry, and we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow highlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware WyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.</description>
