      <title>Secrecy Rate Maximization with Artificial Noise for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security is emerging as a critical performance metric for next-generation wireless networks, but conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems often suffer from severe path loss and are vulnerable to nearby eavesdroppers due to their fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems (PAS) offer a promising alternative, leveraging reconfigurable pinching antennas (PAs) positioned along low-loss dielectric waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-based beamforming scheme for downlink transmissions in PAS, with the goal of maximizing the secrecy rate. A closed-form solution is derived for the single-waveguide scenario, while an alternating optimization approach addresses more complex multiple waveguide setups. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and existing PAS security schemes.</description>

      <title>Correcting Domain Shifts in Electric Motor Vibration Data for Unseen Operating Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of domain shifts in electric motor vibration data created by new operating conditions in testing scenarios, focusing on bearing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The proposed method combines the Harmonic Feature Space (HFS) with regression to correct for frequency and energy differentials in steady-state data, enabling accurate FDD on unseen operating conditions within the range of the training conditions. The HFS aligns harmonics across different operating frequencies, while regression compensates for energy variations, preserving the relative magnitude of vibrations critical for fault detection. The proposed approach is evaluated on a detection problem using experimental data from a Belt-Starter Generator (BSG) electric motor, with test conditions having a minimum 1000 RPM and 5 Nm difference from training conditions. Results demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional analysis techniques, achieving high classification accuracy at a 94% detection rate and effectively reducing domain shifts. The approach is computationally efficient, requires only healthy data for training, and is well-suited for real-world applications where the exact application operating conditions cannot be predetermined.</description>

      <title>GPS-Independent Localization Techniques for Disaster Rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the limitations of traditional localization techniques, such as those using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and life detectors, in localizing victims during disaster rescue efforts. These techniques usually fall short in accuracy, coverage, and robustness to environmental interference. We then discuss the necessary requirements for developing GPS-independent localization techniques in disaster scenarios. Practical techniques should be passive, with straightforward hardware, low computational demands, low power, and high accuracy, while incorporating unknown environmental information. We review various implementation strategies for these techniques, categorized by measurements (time, angle, and signal strength) and operation manners (non-cooperative and cooperative). Case studies demonstrate trade-offs between localization accuracy and complexity, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate localization techniques based on resources and rescue needs for efficient disaster response.</description>

      <title>Neyman-Pearson Detector for Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low power indoor wireless positioning system has been proposed. In this system, Zero-Energy-Devices (ZED) beacons are deployed in Indoor environments, and located on a map with unique broadcast identifiers. They harvest ambient energy to power themselves and backscatter ambient waves from cellular networks to send their identifiers. This paper presents a novel detection method for ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems, with an emphasis on performance evaluation through experimental setups and simulations. We introduce a Neyman-Pearson detection framework, which leverages a predefined false alarm probability to determine the optimal detection threshold. This method, applied to the analysis of backscatter signals in a controlled testbed environment, incorporates the use of BC sequences to enhance signal detection accuracy. The experimental setup, conducted on the FIT/CorteXlab testbed, employs a two-node configuration for signal transmission and reception. Key performance metrics, which is the peak-to-lobe ratio, is evaluated, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed detection model. The results demonstrate a detection system that effectively handles varying noise levels and identifies ZEDs with high reliability. The simulation results show the robustness of the model, highlighting its capacity to achieve desired detection performance even with stringent false alarm thresholds. This work paves the way for robust ZED detection in real-world scenarios, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stream Transmission in Cell-Free MIMO Networks with Coherent AP Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a multi-stream selection framework for \ac{CF-MIMO} networks. Partially coherent transmission has been considered by clustering \acp{AP} into phase-aligned clusters to address the challenges of phase misalignment and inter-cluster interference. A novel stream selection algorithm is developed to dynamically allocate multiple streams to each multi-antenna \ac{UE}, ensuring that the system optimizes the sum rate while minimizing inter-cluster and inter-stream interference. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectral efficiency and fairness in distributed \ac{CF-MIMO} networks.</description>

      <title>Generative and Explainable AI for High-Dimensional Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training framework to address high-dimensional instantaneous channel estimation in wireless communications. Specifically, we train a generative adversarial network to predict a channel realization in the time-frequency-space domain, in which the generator exploits the third-order moment of the input in its loss function and applies a new reparameterization method for latent distribution learning to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the true and estimated channel distributions. Next, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence mechanism to examine how the critic discriminates the generated channel. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing methods in terms of minimizing estimation errors. Additionally, we find that the critic's attention focuses on the high-power portion of the channel's time-frequency representation.</description>

      <title>ACSNet: A Deep Neural Network for Compound GNSS Jamming Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), identifying not only single but also compound jamming signals is crucial for ensuring reliable navigation and positioning, particularly in future wireless communication scenarios such as the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). However, conventional techniques often struggle with low recognition accuracy and high computational complexity, especially under low jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) conditions. To overcome the challenge of accurately identifying compound jamming signals embedded within GNSS signals, we propose ACSNet, a novel convolutional neural network designed specifically for this purpose. Unlike traditional methods that tend to exhibit lower accuracy and higher computational demands, particularly in low JNR environments, ACSNet addresses these issues by integrating asymmetric convolution blocks, which enhance its sensitivity to subtle signal variations. Simulations demonstrate that ACSNet significantly improves accuracy in low JNR regions and shows robust resilience to power ratio (PR) variations, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency for practical GNSS interference management applications.</description>

      <title>Uplink Assisted Joint Channel Estimation and CSI Feedback: An Approach Based on Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) is essential for maximizing spatial resource utilization and improving system spectral efficiency. The separate design of modules in AI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication frameworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback, leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted joint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI acquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution bias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication frameworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the conventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink CSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by leveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in FDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of uplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend multi-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive ablation and scalability experiments.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Channel Estimation Framework for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) refers to a family of RIS architectures characterized by scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal and enables higher wave manipulation flexibility and large performance gains over conventional (diagonal) RIS. To achieve those promising gains, accurate channel state information (CSI) needs to be acquired in BD-RIS assisted communication systems. However, the number of coefficients in the cascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly larger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels associated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be estimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this paper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS assisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS assisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each user antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of independent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance. Building upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum overhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise at the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case with noise at the BS. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding channel estimation overhead reduction over existing schemes in BD-RIS assisted systems.</description>

      <title>A Signal Matrix-Based Local Flaw Detection Framework for Steel Wire Ropes Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steel wire ropes (SWRs) are critical load-bearing components in industrial applications, yet their structural integrity is often compromised by local flaws (LFs). Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) is a widely used non-destructive testing method that detects defects by measuring perturbations in magnetic fields. Traditional MFL detection methods suffer from critical limitations: one-dimensional approaches fail to capture spatial relationships across sensor channels, while multi-dimensional image-based techniques introduce interpolation artifacts and computational inefficiencies. This paper proposes a novel detection framework based on signal matrices, directly processing raw multi-channel MFL signals using a specialized Convolutional Neural Network for signal matrix as input (SM-CNN). The architecture incorporates stripe pooling to preserve channel-wise features and symmetric padding to improve boundary defect detection. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.74% accuracy and 97.85% recall. Additionally, it demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, processing at 87.72 frames per second (FPS) with a low inference latency of 2.6ms and preprocessing time of 8.8ms. With only 1.48 million parameters, this lightweight design supports real-time processing, establishing a new benchmark for SWR inspection in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Secure Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based secure communication system is investigated, where a base station equipped with a CAPA transmits signals to a legitimate user under the existence of an eavesdropper. For improving the secrecy performance, the artificial noise (AN) is employed at the BS for the jamming purpose. We aim at maximizing the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the information-bearing and AN source current patterns, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, a channel subspace-based approach is first proposed via exploiting the result that the optimal current patterns always lie within the subspace spanned by all users' channel responses. Then, the intractable CAPA continuous source current pattern design problem with an infinite number of optimization variables is equivalently transformed into the channel-subspace weighting factor optimization problem with a finite number of optimization variables. A penalty-based successive convex approximation method is developed for iteratively optimizing the finite-size weighting vectors. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a two-stage source current patterns design scheme. Specifically, the information-bearing and AN patterns are first designed using the maximal ration transmission and zero-forcing transmission, respectively. Then, the remaining power allocation is addressed via the one-dimensional search method. Numerical results unveil that 1) the CAPA brings in significant secrecy rate gain compared to the conventional discrete multiple-input multiple-output; 2) the proposed channel subspace-based algorithm outperforms the conventional Fourier-based approach, while sustaining much lower computational complexity; and 3) the two-stage ZF-MRT approach has negligible performance loss for the large transmit power regime.</description>

      <title>A Fully Asynchronous Unsourced Random Access Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fully asynchronous unsourced random access (URA), and propose a high-performing scheme that employs on-off division multiple access (ODMA). In this scheme, active users distribute their data over the transmit block based on a sparse transmission pattern without any limitations on the starting time. At the receiver side, we adopt a double sliding-window decoding approach, utilizing a smaller inner decoding window of two block lengths within a larger outer window to enhance the interference cancellation process. Within the inner window, the receiver iteratively applies preamble-free joint starting time and pattern detection, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation operations. A notable feature of the proposed scheme is its elimination of the need for a preamble for starting time detection; this is achieved using ODMA transmission patterns. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous URA scheme outperforms existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Scalable Transceiver Design for Multi-User Communication in FDD Massive MIMO Systems via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint transceiver design, including pilot transmission, channel feature extraction and feedback, as well as precoding, for low-overhead downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems. Although deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in tackling this problem, existing methods often suffer from poor scalability in practical systems, as the solution obtained in the training phase merely works for a fixed feedback capacity and a fixed number of users in the deployment phase. To address this limitation, we propose a novel DL-based framework comprised of choreographed neural networks, which can utilize one training phase to generate all the transceiver solutions used in the deployment phase with varying sizes of feedback codebooks and numbers of users. The proposed framework includes a residual vector-quantized variational autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) for efficient channel feedback and an edge graph attention network (EGAT) for robust multiuser precoding. It can adapt to different feedback capacities by flexibly adjusting the RVQ codebook sizes using the hierarchical codebook structure, and scale with the number of users through a feedback module sharing scheme and the inherent scalability of EGAT. Moreover, a progressive training strategy is proposed to further enhance data transmission performance and generalization capability. Numerical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior scalability and performance of our approach over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Guided Wave-Based Structural Awareness Under Varying Operating States via Manifold Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) remains a powerful strategy for identifying early-stage defects and safeguarding vital aerospace structures. Yet, its practical use is often hindered by the enormous, high-dimensional data streams produced by sensor arrays operating at megahertz sampling rates, coupled with the added complexity of shifts in environmental and operational conditions (EOCs). Studies have explored various data-compression approaches that retain critical diagnostic details in a lower-dimensional latent space. While conventional techniques can streamline dimensionality to some extent, they do not always capture the nonlinear interactions typical of guided waves. Manifold learning, as illustrated by Diffusion Maps, tackles these nonlinearities by deriving low-dimensional embeddings directly from wave signals, minimizing the need for manual feature extraction. In parallel, developments in deep learning -- particularly autoencoders -- provide an encoder-decoder model for both data compression and reconstruction. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been particularly effective for guided wave applications. However, current methods can still struggle to maintain accurate state estimation under changing EOCs, and they are often limited to a single task. In response, the proposed framework adopts a two-fold strategy: it compresses high-dimensional signals into lower-dimensional representations and then leverages those representations to both estimate structural states and reconstruct the original data, even as conditions vary. Applied to two real-world SHM use-cases, this integrated method has proven its ability to preserve and retrieve key damage signatures under noise, shifting operational parameters, and other complicating factors.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Initialization Refinement in Code-Aided EM for Blind Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI) channel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift ambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to distinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that utilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a technique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to nearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial conditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase and the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed algorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any complexity increase with subsequent iterations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Orbiter Continuous Lunar Beaming</title>

Abstract: In this work, free-space optics-based continuous wireless power transmission between multiple low lunar orbit satellites and a solar panel on the lunar rover located at the lunar south pole are investigated based on the time-varying harvested power and overall system efficiency metrics. The performances are compared between a solar panel with the tracking ability and a fixed solar panel that induces \textit{the cosine effect} due to the time-dependent angle of incidence (AoI). In our work, the Systems Tool Kit (STK) high-precision orbit propagator, which calculates the ephemeris data precisely, is utilized. Interestingly, orbiter deployments in constellations change significantly during a Moon revolution; thus, short-duration simulations cannot be used straightforwardly. In our work, many satellite configurations are assessed to be able to find a Cislunar constellation that establishes a continuous line-of-sight (LoS) between the solar panel and at least a single LLO satellite. It is found that 40-satellite schemes enable the establishment of a continuous WPT system model. Besides, a satellite selection method (SSM) is introduced so that only the best LoS link among multiple simultaneous links from multiple satellites will be active for optimum efficiency. Our benchmark system of a 40-satellite quadruple orbit scheme is compared with 30-satellite and a single satellite schemes based on the average harvested powers and overall system efficiencies 27.3 days so the trade-off options can be assessed from the multiple Cislunar models. The outcomes show that the average system efficiencies of single, 30-satellite, and 40-satellite schemes are 2.84%, 32.33%, and 33.29%, respectively, for the tracking panel and 0.97%, 18.33%, and 20.44%, respectively, for the fixed solar panel case.</description>

      <title>Imaging Transformer for MRI Denoising: a Scalable Model Architecture that enables SNR &lt;&lt; 1 Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a flexible and scalable imaging transformer (IT) architecture with three attention modules for multi-dimensional imaging data and apply it to MRI denoising with very low input SNR.
  Methods: Three independent attention modules were developed: spatial local, spatial global, and frame attentions. They capture long-range signal correlation and bring back the locality of information in images. An attention-cell-block design processes 5D tensors ([B, C, F, H, W]) for 2D, 2D+T, and 3D image data. A High Resolution (HRNet) backbone was built to hold IT blocks. Training dataset consists of 206,677 cine series and test datasets had 7,267 series. Ten input SNR levels from 0.05 to 8.0 were tested. IT models were compared to seven convolutional and transformer baselines. To test scalability, four IT models 27m to 218m parameters were trained. Two senior cardiologists reviewed IT model outputs from which the EF was measured and compared against the ground-truth.
  Results: IT models significantly outperformed other models over the tested SNR levels. The performance gap was most prominent at low SNR levels. The IT-218m model had the highest SSIM and PSNR, restoring good image quality and anatomical details even at SNR 0.2. Two experts agreed at this SNR or above, the IT model output gave the same clinical interpretation as the ground-truth. The model produced images that had accurate EF measurements compared to ground-truth values.
  Conclusions: Imaging transformer model offers strong performance, scalability, and versatility for MR denoising. It recovers image quality suitable for confident clinical reading and accurate EF measurement, even at very low input SNR of 0.2.</description>

      <title>AdapCsiNet: Environment-Adaptive CSI Feedback via Scene Graph-Aided Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for realizing the full potential of multiple-antenna wireless communication systems. While deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback methods have shown promise in reducing feedback overhead, their generalization capability across varying propagation environments remains limited due to their data-driven nature. Existing solutions based on online training improve adaptability but impose significant overhead in terms of data collection and computational resources. In this work, we propose AdapCsiNet, an environment-adaptive DL-based CSI feedback framework that eliminates the need for online training. By integrating environmental information -- represented as a scene graph -- into a hypernetwork-guided CSI reconstruction process, AdapCsiNet dynamically adapts to diverse channel conditions. A two-step training strategy is introduced to ensure baseline reconstruction performance and effective environment-aware adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate that AdapCsiNet achieves up to 46.4% improvement in CSI reconstruction accuracy and matches the performance of online learning methods without incurring additional runtime overhead.</description>

      <title>Radiation Footprint Control in Cell-Free Cooperative ISAC: Optimal Joint BS Activation and Beamforming Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated beamforming across distributed base stations (BSs) in cell-free architectures can efficiently support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users by improving resource sharing and reducing conflicts in the spatial domain. However, coordinating numerous BSs within the ISAC network poses risks of generating substantial interference for other networks sharing the spectrum, while also increasing operational costs from power consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interference-suppressed and cost-optimized cell-free ISAC network by opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrating distributed radio resources to address competing sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) demands. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&amp;C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fast-Powerformer: A Memory-Efficient Transformer for Accurate Mid-Term Wind Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind power forecasting (WPF), as a significant research topic within renewable energy, plays a crucial role in enhancing the security, stability, and economic operation of power grids. However, due to the high stochasticity of meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed) and significant fluctuations in wind power output, mid-term wind power forecasting faces a dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight mid-term wind power forecasting model, termed Fast-Powerformer. The proposed model is built upon the Reformer architecture, incorporating structural enhancements such as a lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) embedding module, an input transposition mechanism, and a Frequency Enhanced Channel Attention Mechanism (FECAM). These improvements enable the model to strengthen temporal feature extraction, optimize dependency modeling across variables, significantly reduce computational complexity, and enhance sensitivity to periodic patterns and dominant frequency components. Experimental results conducted on multiple real-world wind farm datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-Powerformer achieves superior prediction accuracy and operational efficiency compared to mainstream forecasting approaches. Furthermore, the model exhibits fast inference speed and low memory consumption, highlighting its considerable practical value for real-world deployment scenarios.</description>

Abstract: As a new type of multicarrier (MC) scheme built upon the recently discovered delay-Doppler domain orthogonal pulse (DDOP), orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) aims to address the challenges of waveform design in linear time-varying channels. In this paper, we explore the design principles of ODDM and clarify the key ideas underlying the DDOP. We then derive an alternative representation of the DDOP and highlight the fundamental differences between ODDM and conventional MC schemes. Finally, we discuss and compare two implementation methods for ODDM.</description>

      <title>A Unified Hardware Accelerator for Fast Fourier Transform and Number Theoretic Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an indispensable tool for computing efficient polynomial multiplications in post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. It has strong resemblance with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the most widely used algorithm in digital signal processing. In this work, we demonstrate a unified hardware accelerator supporting both 512-point complex FFT as well as 256-point NTT for the recently standardized NIST post-quantum key encapsulation and digital signature algorithms ML-KEM and ML-DSA respectively. Our proposed architecture effectively utilizes the arithmetic circuitry required for complex FFT, and the only additional circuits required are for modular reduction along with modifications in the control logic. Our implementation achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art ML-KEM / ML-DSA NTT accelerators on FPGA, thus demonstrating how an FFT accelerator can be augmented to support NTT and the unified hardware can be used for both digital signal processing and post-quantum lattice-based cryptography applications.</description>

      <title>Focal Split: Untethered Snapshot Depth from Differential Defocus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Focal Split, a handheld, snapshot depth camera with fully onboard power and computing based on depth-from-differential-defocus (DfDD). Focal Split is passive, avoiding power consumption of light sources. Its achromatic optical system simultaneously forms two differentially defocused images of the scene, which can be independently captured using two photosensors in a snapshot. The data processing is based on the DfDD theory, which efficiently computes a depth and a confidence value for each pixel with only 500 floating point operations (FLOPs) per pixel from the camera measurements. We demonstrate a Focal Split prototype, which comprises a handheld custom camera system connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time data processing. The system consumes 4.9 W and is powered on a 5 V, 10,000 mAh battery. The prototype can measure objects with distances from 0.4 m to 1.2 m, outputting 480$\times$360 sparse depth maps at 2.1 frames per second (FPS) using unoptimized Python scripts. Focal Split is DIY friendly. A comprehensive guide to building your own Focal Split depth camera, code, and additional data can be found at https://focal-split.qiguo.org.</description>

      <title>Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase Synchronization in Distributed Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires measurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We present a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze its impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with independent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to accommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the phase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of the interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with low-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking substantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large compared to LOs phase drifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite-energy signal is represented by a square-integrable, complex-valued function $t\mapsto s(t)$ of a real variable $t$, interpreted as time. Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Diagnosis of Defective Elements in Intelligent Reflecting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to circuit failures, defective elements that cannot adaptively adjust the phase shifts of their impinging signals in a desired manner may exist on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Traditional way to locate these defective IRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a huge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper, we will devise novel approaches under which a transmitter sends known pilot signals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on its over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. Specifically, given any set of IRS elements, we propose an efficient method to process the received signals to determine whether this cluster contains defective elements or not with a very high accuracy probability. Based on this method, we show that the over-the-air diagnosis problem belongs to the 20 questions problem, where we can adaptively change the query set at the IRS so as to localize all the defective elements as quickly as possible. Along this line, we first propose a sorted posterior matching (sortPM) based method according to the noisy 20 questions technique, which enables accurate diagnosis even if the answers about the existence of defective elements in some sets of interest are wrong at certain question and answer (Q&amp;A) rounds due to the noisy received signals. Next, to reduce the complexity, we propose a bisection based method according to the noiseless 20 questions technique, which totally trusts the answer at each Q&amp;A round and keeps removing half of the remaining region based on such answers. Via numerical results, we show that our proposed methods can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the defective IRS elements quickly and accurately.</description>

Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a promising technology anticipated to play a key role in the next-generation network of networks, especially as a complementary technology to traditional radio frequency communications, for enhancing networking capabilities beyond conventional terrestrial networks. OWC is already a mature technology with diverse usage scenarios, and can enable integrated applications via wireless access and backhaul networks, dynamic drone and satellite networks, underwater networks, inter- and intra-system interconnecting networks, and vehicular communication networks. Furthermore, novel and emerging technological opportunities such as photovoltaic cells, orbital angular momentum-based modulation, optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, organic light-emitting and photo diodes, and recent advances in ultraviolet communications can help enhance future OWC capabilities even further. Moreover, OWC networks can also support value-added services such as enhanced positioning and gesture recognition. Hence, OWC provides unique functionalities that can play a crucial role in building convergent and resilient future network of networks alongside radio frequency and optical fiber technologies.</description>

      <title>Predictive Target-to-User Association in Complex Scenarios via Hybrid-Field ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and robust target-to-user (T2U) association framework to support reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks that potentially operate within the hybrid field (near-field and far-field). To address the challenges posed by complex vehicle maneuvers and user association ambiguity, an interacting multiple-model filtering scheme is developed, which combines coordinated turn and constant velocity models for predictive beamforming. Building upon this foundation, a lightweight association scheme leverages user-specific integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signaling while employing probabilistic data association to manage clutter measurements in dense traffic. Numerical results validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of both tracking accuracy and association reliability.</description>

      <title>RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.</description>

      <title>Flip-KLJN: Random Resistance Flipping for Noise-Driven Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information-theoretically (unconditionally) secure Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) bit exchange protocol uses two identical resistor pairs with high (H) and low (L) resistance values, driven by Gaussian noise generators emulating Johnson noise with a high common temperature. The resulting mean-square noise voltage on the wire connecting Alice and Bob has three levels: low (L/L), intermediate (H/L or L/H), and high (H/H), and secure key sharing is achieved at the intermediate level (L/H or H/L). This paper introduces the Flip-KLJN scheme, where a pre-agreed intermediate level, such as H/L, triggers a flip of the bit map value during the bit exchange period. For Eve, the bit map flips appear random. Thus, the formerly discarded H/H and L/L situations can also have a pre-agreed bit value mapping, which flips together with the original bit mapping. Thus, Flip-KLJN doubles the key rate and ensures that all three levels on the wire are indistinguishable for Eve. Bit error probabilities are addressed through analytic calculations and computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Diversity Analysis for Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing diversity is fundamental to wireless communication systems, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, where severe path loss and small-scale fading pose significant challenges to system reliability and performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive diversity analysis for indoor THz communication systems, accounting for the combined effects of path loss and small-scale fading, with the latter modeled as an $\alpha-\mu$ distribution to reflect THz indoor channel conditions. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an asymptotic expression. Furthermore, we validate these expressions through extensive simulations, which show strong agreement with the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Our results show that the diversity order in THz systems is primarily determined by the combined effects of the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and the degree of channel frequency selectivity, providing clear insights into how diversity gains can be optimized in high-frequency wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Deep-seeded Clustering for Emotion Recognition from Wearable Physiological Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the circumplex model of affect, an emotional response could characterized by a level of pleasure (valence) and intensity (arousal). As it reflects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, modern wearable wristbands can record non-invasively and during our everyday lives peripheral end-points of this response. While emotion recognition from physiological signals is usually achieved using supervised machine learning algorithms that require ground truth labels for training, collecting it is cumbersome and particularly unfeasible in naturalistic settings, and extracting meaningful insights from these signals requires domain knowledge and might be prone to bias. Here, we propose and test a deep-seeded clustering algorithm that automatically extracts and classifies features from those physiological signals with minimal supervision - combining an autoencoder (AE) for unsupervised feature representation and c-means clustering for fine-grained classification. We also show that the model obtains good performance results across three different datasets frequently used in affective computing studies (accuracies of 80.7% on WESAD, 64.2% on Stress-Predict and 61.0% on CEAP360-VR).</description>

      <title>Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Driving: Challenges, Possible Solutions and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving system. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\times$ and $2.3\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.</description>

      <title>Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline, and evaluates its performance relative to its classical counterpart.</description>
