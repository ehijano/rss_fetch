      <title>Generative Active Learning for the Search of Small-molecule Protein Binders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in machine learning for scientific discovery in recent years, truly de novo design of small molecules which exhibit a property of interest remains a significant challenge. We introduce LambdaZero, a generative active learning approach to search for synthesizable molecules. Powered by deep reinforcement learning, LambdaZero learns to search over the vast space of molecules to discover candidates with a desired property. We apply LambdaZero with molecular docking to design novel small molecules that inhibit the enzyme soluble Epoxide Hydrolase 2 (sEH), while enforcing constraints on synthesizability and drug-likeliness. LambdaZero provides an exponential speedup in terms of the number of calls to the expensive molecular docking oracle, and LambdaZero de novo designed molecules reach docking scores that would otherwise require the virtual screening of a hundred billion molecules. Importantly, LambdaZero discovers novel scaffolds of synthesizable, drug-like inhibitors for sEH. In in vitro experimental validation, a series of ligands from a generated quinazoline-based scaffold were synthesized, and the lead inhibitor N-(4,6-di(pyrrolidin-1-yl)quinazolin-2-yl)-N-methylbenzamide (UM0152893) displayed sub-micromolar enzyme inhibition of sEH.</description>

      <title>Model-based reinforcement learning for protein backbone design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing protein nanomaterials of predefined shape and characteristics has the potential to dramatically impact the medical industry. Machine learning (ML) has proven successful in protein design, reducing the need for expensive wet lab experiment rounds. However, challenges persist in efficiently exploring the protein fitness landscapes to identify optimal protein designs. In response, we propose the use of AlphaZero to generate protein backbones, meeting shape and structural scoring requirements. We extend an existing Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework by incorporating a novel threshold-based reward and secondary objectives to improve design precision. This innovation considerably outperforms existing approaches, leading to protein backbones that better respect structural scores. The application of AlphaZero is novel in the context of protein backbone design and demonstrates promising performance. AlphaZero consistently surpasses baseline MCTS by more than 100% in top-down protein design tasks. Additionally, our application of AlphaZero with secondary objectives uncovers further promising outcomes, indicating the potential of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) in navigating the intricate and nuanced aspects of protein design</description>

      <title>3D-based RNA function prediction tools in rnaglib</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between complex structural features of RNA and biological function is a fundamental challenge in evolutionary studies and in RNA design. However, building datasets of RNA 3D structures and making appropriate modeling choices remains time-consuming and lacks standardization. In this chapter, we describe the use of rnaglib, to train supervised and unsupervised machine learning-based function prediction models on datasets of RNA 3D structures.</description>
