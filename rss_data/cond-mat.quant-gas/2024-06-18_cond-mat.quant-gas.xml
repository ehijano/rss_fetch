      <title>Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial coherent state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>

      <title>Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states and identify a family of organic semiconductors exhibiting the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through chemical functionalisation and through the dielectric environment of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-outcome multipartite Bell inequalities: applications to dimension witnessing and spin-nematic squeezing in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a three-outcome permutationally-invariant Bell inequality, which we show to be naturally suited to explore nonlocal correlations in many-body spin-1 systems or SU(3) models. In the specific, we show how to derive from this inequality experimentally practical Bell correlation witnesses based on the measurement of collective spin components. Moreover, we present approaches that allow us to derive scalable Bell dimension witnesses, namely criteria whose violation signals the impossibility of reproducing the observed statistics by single-particle Hilbert spaces of a certain dimension.This enables the certification of genuine three-level correlations that cannot occur in two-level, i.e. qubit, systems. As an example, we show the application of these witnesses in spin-nematic squeezed states, such as the one that can be prepared in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from the experiment of electrostatic conveyor belt for excitons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the experiment of electrostatic conveyor belt for indirect excitons [A. G. Winbow, \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{106}, 196806 (2011)], we study the exciton patterns for understanding the exciton dynamics. By analyzing the exciton diffusion, we find that the patterns mainly come from the photoluminescence of two kinds of excitons. The patterns near the laser spot come from the hot excitons which can be regarded as the classical particles. However, the patterns far from the laser spot come from the cooled excitons or coherent excitons. Taking into account of the finite lifetime of Bosonic excitons and of the interactions between them, we build a time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation including the non-Hermitian dissipation to describe the coherent exciton dynamics. The real-time and imaginary-time evolutions are used alternately to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in order to simulate the exciton diffusion accompanied with the exciton cooling in the moving lattices. By calculating the escape probability, we obtain the transport distances of the coherent excitons in the conveyor which are consistent with the experimental data. The cooling speed of excitons is found to be important in the coherent exciton transport. Moreover, the plateau in the average transport distance cannot be explained by the dynamical localization-delocalization transition induced by the disorders.</description>

      <title>Strongly anisotropic vortices in dipolar quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct strongly anisotropic quantum droplets with embedded vorticity in the 3D space, with mutually perpendicular vortex axis and polarization of atomic magnetic moments. Stability of these anisotropic vortex quantum droplets (AVQDs) is verified by means of systematic simulations. Their stability area is identified in the parametric plane of the total atom number and scattering length of the contact interactions. We also construct vortex-antivortex-vortex bound states and find their stability region in the parameter space. The application of a torque perpendicular to the vorticity axis gives rise to robust intrinsic oscillations or rotation of the AVQDs. The effect of three-body losses on the AVQD stability is considered too. The results show that the AVQDs can retain the topological structure (vorticity) for a sufficiently long time if the scattering length exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <title>Narrow-linewidth exciton-polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton laser is a promising source of coherent light for low-energy applications due to its low-threshold operation. However, a detailed experimental study of its spectral purity, which directly affects its coherence properties is still missing. Here}, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. \red{The long coherence time of the exciton-polariton system uncovered here opens up opportunities for manipulating its macroscopic quantum state, which is essential for applications in classical and quantum computing.</description>
