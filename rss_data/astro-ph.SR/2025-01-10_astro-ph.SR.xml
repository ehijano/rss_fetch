      <title>Mind the Gap II: the near-UV fluxes of M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf stars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of utilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two distinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the $M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number of stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\sim9.4$, coinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy transportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood stellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the effective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at $\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass, contributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two populations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and young stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with bright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.</description>

      <title>Orbits of Six Triple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint analysis of position measurements and radial velocities of six triple stellar systems is conducted to determine their inner and/or outer orbits. Accumulation of such data is needed to study the architecture of stellar hierarchies and its relation to the formation mechanisms. The inner periods in the six systems (HIP 11783, 64836, 72423, 84720, 89234, and 105404) range from 0.5 days to 44 yr. The shortest outer period of 3.34 yr is found in the compact triple HIP~105404 (BS Ind). The resolved triple system HIP 64836 has comparable inner and outer periods (5 and 30 yr), placing it near the limit of dynamical stability, while its quasi-circular and coplanar orbits suggest a 1:6 mean motion resonance. The periods in HIP 89234 (44 and ~450 yr) are also comparable, but the mutual orbit inclination is large, 54 degrees. Masses of the components are estimated and each system is discussed individually.</description>

      <title>Structures of various types of symmetry in the solar activity cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar cycle is a complex phenomenon. To comprehensively understand it, we have to study various tracers. The most important component of this complex is the solar dynamo, which is understood as self-excitation of the solar magnetic field in the form of traveling waves somewhere in the convection zone. Along with the solar dynamo, the formation of the solar cycle involves other processes that are associated with the dynamo but are not its necessary part. We give a review of such phenomena that have not yet been explained in terms of dynamo theory. We consider the manifestations of the solar cycle in harmonics of the solar large-scale surface magnetic field, including zonal, sectorial, and tesseral harmonics; analyze their contribution to magnetic energy; and identify phases of the activity cycle using harmonics of different types of symmetry. The universal magnetic scenario of a solar activity cycle does not depend on its number and height. At the beginning of the cycle on the photosphere, the zonal harmonics account for 37-42% of the total energy (not 100%, as assumed in simplified descriptions). Sectorial harmonics do not disappear at all but account for 5-10% of the total energy. At this stage, the greatest energy (about 40%) is contained in the tesseral harmonics. As the cycle develops, the relative energy of zonal harmonics gradually decreases, reaching a minimum of 15-18% immediately before the onset of the sunspot maximum. The relative energy of sectorial harmonics increases and reaches a maximum (60-65%) somewhat later than the calendar date of the sunspot maximum. A particular feature of the tesseral harmonics is that their relative energy index changes in a much narrower range and never falls below 40% even at the cycle minimum. This is due to active regions and nonglobal magnetic fields. It is possible that tesseral harmonics are formed in shallow subphotospheric layers.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor Systems of Classical Novae in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first characterization of the statistical relationship between a large sample of novae in M31 and their progenitor stellar populations in the form of a delay time distribution. To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud II: the connection with the progenitors' properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of planetary nebulae (PNe) offers the opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of the dust production mechanism during the very late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. We study the relationship between the properties of PNe, particularly the gas and dust content, with the mass and metallicity of the progenitor stars, to understand how dust production works in the late AGB phases, and to shed new light on the physical processes occurring to the stars and the material in their surroundings since the departure from the AGB until the PN phase. We consider a sample of 9 PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 7 out of which characterized by the presence of carbonaceous dust, the remaining 2 with silicates. For these stars the masses and the metallicity of the progenitor stars were estimated. We combine results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling with those coming from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution, to find the relation between the dust and gas mass of the PNe considered and the The physical properties of carbon-rich PNe are influenced by the mass of the progenitor star. Specifically, the dust-to-gas ratio in the nebula increases from 5x10^{-4}to 6x10^{-3} as the progenitor star's mass increases from approximately 0.9Msun to 2Msun. This change is partly influenced by the effective temperature of the PNe, and it occurs because higher-mass carbon stars are more efficient at producing dust. Consequently, as the progenitor's mass increases, the gas mass of the PNe decreases, since the larger amounts of dust lead to greater effects from radiation pressure, which pushes the gas outwards. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn by the study of the PNe with silicate-type dust, because the sub-sample is made up of 2 PNe only, one of which is almost dust-free.</description>

      <title>Exploring the variation in the dynamic rotation profile of the hotter solar atmosphere using mutliwavelength data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation at different layers, although crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field, has been a subject to contradictory results throughout the past century. In this study, we thereby unify the results for different parts of the multi-thermal Solar atmosphere by utilizing 13 years of data in 7 wavelength channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) atop the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Using the method of image correlation, we find that the solar atmosphere exhibits a rotational profile that is up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster at the equator and comparatively less differential than that of the photosphere, as derived from Doppler measurements and sunspots, respectively and exhibits variation at different respective heights. Additionally, we find results suggestive of the role played by the rooting of different magnetic field structures on a comparison with helioseismology data.</description>

      <title>Observational Study of the Atmospheric Gravity Waves in the lower Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar chromosphere exhibits a variety of waves originating from the photosphere and deeper layers, causing oscillations at different heights with distinct frequencies. This study identifies and analyze Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) and acoustic waves at various height pairs within the solar atmosphere utilising H$\alpha$, Ca II IR and Fe I 6173 A imaging spectroscopic observations from Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. We study and compare oscillations by analyzing power maps generated using velocities obtained from the filtergram difference and bisector methods. Our analysis shows a consistent increase in power with height in the solar chromosphere for both methods. In addition to this, our results show that AGWs are detected within or near magnetic flux concentration regions, where spicules are also predominant, exhibiting significant power in the chromosphere. These regions also feature inclined magnetic fields, which might be contributing to the propagation of these low-frequency AGWs in the chromosphere. Examining average power maps at spicule locations reveals significant power at AGWs frequency across different chromospheric heights. We speculate that these AGWs propagate upward along spicular structures and were not previously detected in the studies employing space-time map due to their limited lifetime. This study provides insights into the complex dynamics of solar chromospheric waves influenced by magnetic field, contributing to our understanding of AGWs and acoustic waves propagation across different layers of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>On the conditioning of the solar corona due to large flaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to better characterize the conditions of the solar corona and especially with respect to the occurrence of confined and eruptive flares. Therefore, we have modeled the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar cycle 24. Methods: Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data around each event, we employ nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to approximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source regions. Superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the time series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities is used to pin down the characteristics of the pre- and post-flare time evolution, as well as to assess flare-related changes. Results: (1) During the 24 hours leading to a major flare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux evolve closely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to confined flares the free energy evolves more similar with respect to the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying field, while it is the opposite prior to eruptive flares. (2) The flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\% of major flares when combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local stability. (3) The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels within $\approx$\,6 to 12~hours after eruptive major M-class flares while the impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. (4) Postflare replenishment times of $\gtrsim$12~hours after eruptive X-class flares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive X-class flares within a few hours.</description>

      <title>A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Periods of outbursts and standstills and parameters variations in two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our results on two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc. We apply observational data for the periods that cover the states of outbursts and standstills, which are typical for this type of objects. We report an appearance of periodic oscillations in brightness during the standstill in AT Cnc, with small amplitude variations of 0.03 - 0.04 mag and periodicity of $\approx 20-30$ min. Based on the estimated derredened color index (B - V )0, we calculate the color temperature for both states of the two objects. During the transition from the outbursts to the standstill's state Z Cam varies from bluer to redder, while AT Cnc stays redder in both states. We calculate some of the stars' parameters as: the radii of the primary and secondary components, and the orbital separation for both objects. We construct the profiles of the effective temperature in the discs of the two objects. Comparing the parameters of both systems, we see that Z Cam is definitely the hotter object and we conclude it has a more active accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Vertical shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones: effects of the full Coriolis acceleration and thermal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Resolving an Asteroseismic Catastrophe: Structural Diagnostics from p-mode Phase Functions off the Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation $\delta\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily interpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an interpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating $\delta\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this estimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red giants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We derive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when applied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative features of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants. This expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale primarily with their global seismic properties as $\delta\nu_{02} \propto \Delta\nu^2/\nu_\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their internal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the transition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently reported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission data. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the convective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a third of a wavelength at $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at which point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the boundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or $r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective boundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.</description>

Abstract: In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.</description>

Abstract: Astronomy datasets can be challenging to use for high school astronomy classes. Data science education pedagogy can be leveraged to create astronomy activities in which students interrogate data, create visuals, and use statistical thinking to construct astronomy knowledge. This session describes how the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) can provide a web-based interface for students to use basic data science techniques in astronomy to build data literacy while learning astronomical concepts. The activities shared will be available for anyone but were designed to be used in astro 101 classes in high school or early college.</description>

      <title>Identifying Flare Locations Through Exoplanet Transit Occultations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, with long lifespans, a high occurrence rate of rocky planets, and close-in habitable zones. However, high stellar activity in the form of frequent flaring and any associated coronal mass ejections may drive atmospheric escape with the bombardment of radiation and high-energy particles, drastically impacting the habitability of these systems. The stellar latitude where flares and coronal mass ejections occur determines the space weather that exoplanets are subject to, with high-energy particle events associated with equatorial flares producing significant atmospheric erosion. However, the flaring latitudes for M dwarfs remain largely unconstrained. To aid in the effort to locate these flaring regions we explore the applicability of flare occultations using optical photometry to identify the latitudes of flares. As a planet transits in front of an ongoing flare the timing and geometry of the transit can be used to constrain the latitude and longitude of the flare. We predict the probability of detecting an occultation for known transiting planets and eclipsing binaries. From this, we estimate 3-22 detectable occultations exist within the TESS primary mission photometry, with the majority occurring in eclipsing binary observations. To demonstrate this technique, we analyze a candidate flare occultation event for the eclipsing binary CM Draconis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.</description>

      <title>Multiple Populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2257: No Major Environmental Effect on the Formation of Multiple Populations of the Old Globular Clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How the environment of the host galaxy affects the formation of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the outstanding questions in the near-field cosmology. To understand the true nature of the old GC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry of the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated populational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\pm$4), where the FG and SG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar cumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is dynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\pm$0.00 dex($\sigma$=0.05 dex) and our metallicity is $\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution spectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\sim$ $-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than the SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to Galactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic of GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium enhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit that the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with the GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass. We show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in the $\Delta$W$_{\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\rm FG}/N_{\rm tot}$, and $\log M/M_{\rm \odot}$ domains. Our result indicates that the environment of the host galaxy did not play a major role in the formation and evolution of GC MPs.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.</description>

      <title>Impact of photoevaporative winds in chemical models of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.</description>

      <title>MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo at high Pm numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To power gamma-ray bursts and other high-energy events, large-scale magnetic fields are required to extract rotational energy from compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key mechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field amplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which angular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime reveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and buoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these findings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in stratified simulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\mathrm{Pm}$ regime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in the regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high $\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo coefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described by an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic field as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a shorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the off-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic field in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in global simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\sim 5$, which could lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in the high-Pm regime.</description>

      <title>On the response of massive main sequence stars to mass accretion and outflow at high rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a one-dimensional stellar evolution model, we find that massive main-sequence stars can accrete mass at very high mass accretion rates without expanding much if they lose a significant fraction of this mass from their outer layers simultaneously with mass accretion. We assume the accretion process is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner zones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting star. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove more envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we mimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal phases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand much if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short episodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into the envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential well stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to bright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the launching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Their secular period changes, characterized through $O-C$ (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams, offer valuable insights into their evolution. While evolutionary period changes are well understood from both observational and theoretical perspectives, shorter timescale period changes (on the order of ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ days) - known as non-evolutionary period changes are yet to be systematically explored.
  In this work, we present a detailed and comprehensive search for non-evolutionary period changes using $O-C$ analysis of Magellanic Cloud (MC) Cepheids, based on 20+ years of OGLE photometry data. Our sample includes both the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids, focusing on single radial mode Cepheids (both fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) modes). The results are grouped into two phenomena: (a) Cepheids in binary systems (b) Non-linear period changes.</description>

      <title>The occurrence of powerful flares stronger than X10 class in Solar Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar flares stronger than X10 (S-flares, &gt;X10) are the highest class flares which significantly impact on the Sun's evolution and space weather. Based on observations of Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) at soft X-ray (SXR) wavelength and the daily sunspot numbers (DSNs) since 1975, we obtained some interesting and heuristic conclusions: (1) Both S-flares and the more powerful extremely strong flares (ES-flares, &gt;X14.3) mostly occur in the late phases of solar cycles and low-latitude regions on the solar disk; (2) Similar to X-class flares, the occurrence of S-flares in each solar cycle is somewhat random, but the occurrence of ES-flares seems to be dominated by the mean DSN (Vm) and its root-mean-square deviation during the valley phase (Vd) before the cycle: the ES-flare number is strongly correlated with Vd, and the occurrence time of the first ES-flare is anti-correlated with Vd and Vm. These facts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the more the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred. We proposed that the Sun may have a low-latitude active zone (LAZ), and most ES-flares are generated from the interaction between LAZ and the newly emerging active regions. The correlations and the linear regression functions may provide an useful method to predict the occurrence of ES-flares in an upcoming solar cycle, which derives that solar cycle 25 will have about 2 ES-flares after the spring of 2027.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-7, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>

Abstract: Planets may be rotationally flattened, and their oblateness thus provide useful information on their formation and evolution. Here we develop a new algorithm that can compute the transit light curve due to an oblate planet very efficiently and use it to study the detectability of planet oblateness (and spin obliquity) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e, as an example, we show that observations of a single transit with JWST are able to detect a Saturn-like oblateness ($f=0.1$) with high confidence, or set a stringent upper limit on the oblateness parameter, as long as the planetary spin is slightly misaligned ($\gtrsim 20^\circ$) with respect to its orbital direction. Based on known obliquity measurements and theoretical arguments, it is reasonable to believe that this level of misalignment may be common. We estimate the sensitivity limit of JWST in oblateness detections and highlight the importance of better characterizations of cold planets in planning future JWST transit observations. The potential to detect rings, moons, and atmospheric species of the cold giants with JWST is also discussed.</description>
