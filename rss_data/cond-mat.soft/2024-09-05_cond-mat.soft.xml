      <title>Interface dynamics of wet active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, instead, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in soft repulsive polymer mixtures: foundation and implication for chromatin organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the wide range of length scales, the analysis of polymer systems often requires coarse-graining, for which various levels of description may be possible depending on the phenomenon under consideration. Here, we provide a super-coarse grained description, where polymers are represented as a succession of mesosopic soft beads which are allowed to overlap with others. We then investigate the phase separation behaviors in a mixture of such homopolymers based on mean-field theory, and discuss universal aspects of the miscibility phase diagram in comparison with the numerical simulation. We also discuss an extension of our analysis to mixtures involving random copolymers, which might be interesting in the context of chromatin organization in a cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Necking of thin-walled cylinders via bifurcation of incompressible nonlinear elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Necking localization under quasi-static uniaxial tension is experimentally observed in ductile thin-walled cylindrical tubes, made of soft polypropylene. Necking nucleates at multiple locations along the tube and spreads throughout, involving higher-order modes, evidencing trefoil and fourthfoiled (but rarely even fifth-foiled) shaped cross-sections. No evidence of such a complicated necking occurrence and growth was found in other ductile materials for thin-walled cylinders under quasi-static loading. With the aim of modelling this phenomenon, as well as all other possible bifurcations, a twodimensional formulation is introduced, in which only the mean surface of the tube is considered, paralleling the celebrated Fl\"ugge treatment of axially-compressed cylindrical shells. This treatment is extended to include tension and a broad class of nonlinear-hyperelastic constitutive law for the material, which is also assumed to be incompressible. The theoretical framework leads to a number of new results, not only for tensile axial force (where necking is modelled and, as a particular case, the classic Consid\`ere formula is shown to represent the limit of very thin tubes), but also for compressive force, providing closed-form formulae for wrinkling (showing that a direct application of the Fl\"ugge equation can be incorrect) and for Euler buckling. It is shown that the J2-deformation theory of plasticity (the simplest constitutive assumption to mimic through nonlinear elasticity the plastic branch of a material) captures multiple necking and occurrence of higher-order modes, so that experiments are explained. The presented results are important for several applications, ranging from aerospace and automotive engineering to the vascular mechanobiology, where a thin-walled tube (for instance an artery, or a catheter, or a stent) may become unstable not only in compression, but also in tension.</description>

      <title>Solubility of carbon dioxide in water: some useful results for hydrate nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the solubility of carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) in water along the isobar of 400 bar is determined by computer simulations using the well-known TIP4P/Ice force field for water and TraPPE model for CO$_{2}$. In particular, the solubility of CO$_{2}$ in water when in contact with the CO$_{2}$ liquid phase, and the solubility of CO$_{2}$ in water when in contact with the hydrate have been determined. The solubility of CO$_{2}$ in a liquid-liquid system decreases as temperature increases. The solubility of CO$_{2}$ in a hydrate-liquid system increases with temperature. The two curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at 400 bar ($T_{3}$). We compare the predictions with the $T_{3}$ obtained using the direct coexistence technique in a previous work. The results of both methods agree and we suggest 290(2)K as the value of $T_{3}$ for this system using the same cutoff distance for dispersive interactions. We also propose a novel and alternative route to evaluate the change in chemical potential for the formation of hydrate along the isobar. The new approach is based on the use of the solubility curve of CO$_{2}$ when the aqueous solution is in contact with the hydrate phase. It considers rigorously the non-ideality of the aqueous solution of CO$_{2}$, providing reliable values for driving force for nucleation of hydrates in good agreement with other thermodynamic routes used. It is shown that the driving force for hydrate nucleation at 400 bar is larger for the methane hydrate than for the carbon dioxide hydrate when compared at the same supercooling. We have also analyzed and discussed the effect of the cutoff distance of the dispersive interactions and the occupancy of CO$_{2}$ on the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate.</description>

      <title>Fully-Polarized Topological Isostatic Metamaterials in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological surface states are unique to topological materials and are immune to disturbances. In isostatic lattices, mechanical topological floppy modes exhibit softness depending on the polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in three dimensions, the polarization of topological floppy modes is disrupted by the ubiquitous mechanical Weyl lines. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases free of Weyl lines. Floppy modes emerge exclusively on a particular surface of the three-dimensional isostatic structure, leading to the strongly asymmetric stiffness between opposing boundaries. Additionally, uniform soft strains can reversibly shift the lattice configuration to Weyl phases, reducing the stiffness contrast to a trivially comparable level. Our work demonstrates the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases in three dimensions, and paves the way towards engineering soft and adaptive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Cutting Mechanics of Soft Compressible Solids: Force-radius scaling versus bulk modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting mechanics in soft solids present a complex mechanical challenge due to the intricate behavior of soft ductile materials as they undergo crack nucleation and propagation. Recent research has explored the relationship between the cutting force needed to continuously cut a soft material and the radius of the wire (blade). A typical simplifying assumption is that of material incompressibility, albeit no material in nature is really incompressible. In this study, we relax this assumption and examine how material (in)compressibility influences the correlation between cutting forces and material properties like toughness and modulus. The ratio {\mu}/\k{appa}, where {\mu} and \k{appa} are the shear and bulk moduli, indicates the material's degree of compressibility, where incompressible materials have {\mu}/\k{appa}=0, and larger {\mu}/\k{appa} provide higher volumetric compressibility. Following previous observations, we obtain two cutting regimes: (i) high toughness or small wire radius, and (ii) low toughness or large wire radius. Regime (i) is dominated by frictional dissipation, while regime (ii) is dominated by adhesive debonding and/or the wear resistance of the material. These regimes are controlled by the ratio between the wire radius and the elasto-cohesive length of the material: the critical crack opening displacement at fast fracture under uniaxial tension. In the large radius, regime (ii), our theoretical findings reveal that incompressible materials require larger forces. Notably, however, the elasto-cohesive length of the material, defining the transition wire radius between regimes (i) and (ii), is larger for compressible materials, which are therefore more likely to be cut in regime (i), and thus requiring larger cutting forces.</description>

      <title>Ion-specific Stability of Gold Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) play an important role in fundamental research and development due to their versatile applications and biocompatibility. This study addresses the aging of three AuNP suspensions after the addition of various sodium salts along the well-known Hofmeister series (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, NaSCN) at different salt concentrations between 10 mM and 100 mM. The AuNP types differ in size (5 nm vs. 11 nm in diameter) and the capping type (physisorbed citrate vs. covalently bound mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)). We monitor the aggregation of the AuNPs and the suspension stability optically (absorption spectroscopy, photography) and by electron microscopy. The large range of salt concentrations results in a large variety of colloidal stability, e.g., from stable suspensions to fast destabilization followed by sedimentation. At intermediate and high salt concentration strong ion-specific effects emerge that are non-monotonous with respect to the Hofmeister series. In particular, the chaotropic salts, NaI and NaSCN, strongly alter the absorption spectra in very different ways. NaI fuses AuNPs together influencing the primary absorption, while NaSCN retains AuNP structure during aggregation much stronger than the remaining sodium halides, resulting in a secondary absorption peak. Although decreasing the size of AuNPs leads to more stable suspensions, the ion specific effects are even more pronounced due to the increase in total available surface. Even the covalently bound MPA capping is not able to stabilize AuNPs against particle fusion by NaI, although it delays the process. Despite the complex interplay between different effects of ions on the stability of colloidal dispersions, this study disentangles the different effects from electrostatic screening, via adsorption at the interface and bridging of AuNPs, to the competition between ions and the capping agent of the AuNPs.</description>

      <title>Margination of artificially stiffened red blood cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Margination, a fundamental process in which leukocytes migrate from the flowing blood to the vessel wall, is well-documented in physiology. However, it is still an open question on how the differences in cell size and stiffness of white and red cells contribute to this phenomenon. To investigate the specific influence of cell stiffness, we conduct experimental and numerical studies on the segregation of a binary mixture of artificially stiffened red blood cells within a suspension of healthy cells. The resulting distribution of stiffened cells within the channel is found to depend on the channel geometry, as demonstrated with slit, rectangular, and cylindrical cross-sections. Notably, an unexpected central peak in the distribution of stiffened RBCs, accompanied by fourfold peaks at the corners, emerges in agreement with simulations. Our results unveil a non-monotonic variation in segregation/margination concerning hematocrit and flow rate, challenging the prevailing belief that higher flow rates lead to enhanced margination.</description>

      <title>Orientational properties of the HGO system in a slit geometry in two-dimensional and three-dimensional case from Monte Carlo simulations and Onsager theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A problem of the orientational and density structure properties of a confined three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) Hard Gausssian Overlap (HGO) ellipsoids has been revisited using the Onsager-type second virial approximation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and constant-pressure Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations. At the walls the asssumed particles in 3D are forced to exhibit planar alignment. In the nematic as well as in the smectic regime particles situated apart from the walls attain homeotropic arrangement. This unusual bistable rearrangement is named as the eigenvalue exchange problem of the order parameter tensor. At the same time a bistable arrangement is not observed in the two-dimensional case of the same system. Comparison of the DFT theory and MC simulation results has been given. Whereas comparison of the orientational properties obtained from MC simulations and DFT theory is reasonable for a large range of densities, it does not concern the density profiles. In denser systems differences become larger. It occurred, however, that by manipulating degree of penetrability of the particles at the walls one can influence the surfacial density which improves comparison. A discussion upon the problem what factors promote simultaneous existence of planar and homeotropic arrangement in a confinement has been provided.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Interstellar Ice Morphology: Atomistic Simulations Reveal the Complex Behavior of Ethanethiol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethanethiol (C$_2$H$_5$SH), a molecule detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), indicates the rich chemistry involving sulfur atoms. However, its behavior at low temperatures remains elusive, particularly the reported transition from an amorphous phase to a crystal. This study employs classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce the liquid-state properties of ethanethiol and to simulate the initial amorphous state of ethanethiol films deposited on a KBr substrate. The amorphous ethanethiol did not show spontaneous crystallization upon increasing temperature. Also, ethanethiol ice crystals exhibit melting behavior on KBr substrate at elevated temperatures. Our MD simulations of thin ice samples do not show any signature reversible phase change. It will be interesting to continue this study with a thicker sample, which is beyond our current computational means. These findings underscore the complexity of icy mantle morphology on cold ISM dust grains.</description>

      <title>UNC-104 transport properties are robust and independent of changes in its cargo binding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cargo distribution within eukaryotic cells relies on the active transport mechanisms driven by molecular motors. Despite their critical role, the intricate relationship between motor transport properties and cargo binding - and its impact on motor distribution - remains inadequately understood. Additionally, improper regulation of ubiquitination, a pivotal post-translational modification that affects protein degradation, activation, and localization, is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent data showed that ubiquitination can alter motor-cargo binding of the Kinesin-3 motor UNC-104 / KIF1A that transports synaptic vesicles. To investigate how ubiquitin-like modifications affect motor protein function, particularly cargo binding, transport properties, and distribution, we utilize the PLM neuron of C. elegans as a model system. Using fluorescent microscopy, we assess the distribution of cargo-bound UNC-104 motors along the axon and probe their dynamics using FRAP experiments. We model cargo binding kinetics with a Master equation and motor density dynamics using a Fokker-Planck approach. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that ubiquitin-like knockdowns enhance UNC-104's cooperative binding to its cargo. However, these modifications do not affect UNC-104's transport properties, such as processivity and diffusivity. Thus, while ubiquitin-like modifications significantly impact the cargo-binding of UNC-104, they do not alter its transport dynamics, keeping the homeostatic distribution of UNC-104 unchanged.</description>

      <title>From Substrate Dissipation to Internal Dissipation Vertex Model Dynamics: Generating Sustained Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order, plays an important role in this process. Here we extend an active nematic vertex model by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, dominant in epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, which are found in many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets confined to a channel, providing a link between the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics and continuum active nematics, whose behaviour in a channel is theoretically understood and experimentally realisable. Our findings also show a simple mechanism that could account for collective cell migration correlated over distances large compared to the cell size, as observed during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of dielectric spectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnitude of the relative permittivity of the ferroelectric nematic phase (NF) is under a lively scientific discussion since the phase was recently discovered. Dielectric spectroscopy measurements (DSM) give a huge value of relative permittivity, which depends on the cell thickness, but this is argued to result from a misinterpretation of the DSM results. We have conducted DSM using a set of cells differing in thickness of the NF layer, type of electrodes and presence/absence of nanoscale-thick surface layers. To model the DSM results, cells are presented by an equivalent electric circuit that includes a capacitor due to the NF layer with frequency dependent complex relative permittivity, capacitors due to surface layers, and a resistor describing limited conductivity of electrodes. DSM results for different cells with the same liquid crystal in the NF phase, are semi-quantitatively reproduced by the same set of physical parameters if a huge relative permittivity of the NF, which is even orders of magnitude larger than the measured apparent values, is assumed. We show that the capacitance of surface layers should be considered also in cells with no polymer alignment layer on electrodes.</description>

Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D. In living matter moreover, 2D defects have been linked to biological functions, but the role of 3D polar defects is unclear. Combining computational and experimental approaches, we investigate how confinement geometry controls surface-aligned polar fluids, and what biological role 3D polar defects play in tissues interacting with extracellular boundaries. We discover a charge-preserving transition between 3D defect configurations driven by boundary geometry and independent of material parameters, and show that defect positions predict the locations where fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for development -- form within the confined polar tissue of the mouse embryo. Experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we moreover create additional lumina at predicted defect locations. Our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. We expect this defect control principle to apply broadly to systems with orientational order.</description>

Abstract: Estimating parameters from data is a fundamental problem, customarily done by minimizing a loss function between a model and observed statistics. In scattering-based analysis, researchers often employ their domain expertise to select a specific range of wave vectors for analysis, a choice that can vary depending on the specific case. We introduce another paradigm that defines a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of data processing and propagates the uncertainty for parameter estimation, termed the ab initio uncertainty quantification (AIUQ). As an illustrative example, we demonstrate this approach with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) that extracts dynamical information through Fourier analysis at a selected range of wave vectors. We first show that the conventional way of estimation in DDM is equivalent to fitting a temporal variogram in the reciprocal space using a latent factor model. Then we derive the maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which optimally weighs the information at all wave vectors, therefore eliminating the need to select the range of wave vectors. Furthermore, we substantially reduce the computational cost by utilizing the generalized Schur algorithm for Toeplitz covariances without approximation. Simulated studies validate that AIUQ improves estimation accuracy and enables model selection with automated analysis. The utility of AIUQ is also demonstrated by three distinct sets of experiments: first in an isotropic Newtonian fluid, pushing limits of optically dense systems compared to multiple particle tracking; next in a system undergoing a sol-gel transition, automating the determination of gelling points and critical exponent; and lastly, in discerning anisotropic diffusive behavior of colloids in a liquid crystal. These outcomes collectively underscore AIUQ's versatility to capture system dynamics in an efficient and automated manner.</description>
