      <title>Standardizing Force Reconstruction in Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution imaging and quantitative force measurement, which is critical for understanding nanoscale mechanical, chemical, and biological interactions. In dynamic AFM modes, however, interaction forces are not directly measured; they must be mathematically reconstructed from observables such as amplitude, phase, or frequency shift. Many reconstruction techniques have been proposed over the last two decades, but they rely on different assumptions and have been applied inconsistently, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparison. Here, we systematically evaluate major force reconstruction methods in both frequency- and amplitude-modulation AFM, detailing their theoretical foundations, performance regimes, and sources of error. To support benchmarking and reproducibility, we introduce an open-source software package that unifies all widely used methods, enabling side-by-side comparisons across different formulations. This work represents a critical step toward achieving consistent and interpretable AFM force spectroscopy, thereby supporting the more reliable application of AFM in fields ranging from materials science to biophysics.</description>

      <title>Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (&gt; 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.</description>

      <title>Influence Mechanism of Truncation on Low-Frequency Phase Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by advances in electronic technology, modern digital phasemeters have significantly improved in integration and functionality, enabling real-time measurement and analysis of dynamic signals. High-precision phase measurement is closely associated with the quantization process. This paper specifically analyzes the white and non-white noise characteristics associated with the quantization errors of phase truncation in digital phasemeters. The error can be considered white noise under specific conditions, which power correlates with the resolution of quantizer and is uniformly distributed within the Nyquist frequency. However, when the signal frequency and sampling frequency are close to an integer multiple, the non-white noise caused by truncation can result in low-frequency phase noise. Additionally, artifacts may induce nonlinear phase errors. Introducing Gaussian dither synthesized by LFSRs can smooth the truncation process, thereby mitigating its impacts on phase measurement. The results indicate that for a 10 MHz signal under test, the noise floor of the phasemeter exceeds the requirement from 2 mHz to 0.1 Hz due to the integer multiple. After adding dither, the phase noise was optimized by 9.5 dB at 10 mHz, achieving the requirement of 1.3 $\rm{\upmu rad/Hz^{1/2}} \cdot \rm{NSF}$ from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz in space gravitational wave detection. This demonstrates that adding dither can effectively suppress the low-frequency phase noise caused by truncation.</description>

      <title>First positronium imaging using $^{44}$Sc with the J-PET scanner: a case study on the NEMA-Image Quality phantom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI), an emerging extension of conventional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, offers a novel window for probing the submolecular properties of biological tissues by imaging the mean lifetime of the positronium atom. Currently, the method is under rapid development in terms of reconstruction and detection systems. Recently, the first in vivo PLI of the human brain was performed using the J-PET scanner utilizing the $^{68}$Ga isotope. However, this isotope has limitations due to its comparatively low prompt gamma yields, which is crucial for positronium lifetime measurement. Among alternative radionuclides, $^{44}$Sc stands out as a promising isotope for PLI, characterized by a clinically suitable half-life (4.04 hours) emitting 1157 keV prompt gamma in 100% cases after the emission of the positron. This study reports the first experimental demonstration of PLI with $^{44}$Sc, carried out on a NEMA-Image Quality (IQ) phantom using the Modular J-PET tomograph-the first plastic scintillators-based PET scanner.</description>

      <title>Development of an imager with high time resolution optical photon counter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical transient phenomena on sub-millisecond timescales, such as fast radio bursts and giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar, have been primarily observed in radio wavebands. To investigate their origins, a photon detector with high sensitivity and high time resolution is required also in other wavelengths. Recently, we developed the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY), an observation system utilizing a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) as a sensor. The sensor consists of 64 pixels, each comprising a GAPD and a quenching resistor, with pixel sizes of 75, 100, 150, and 200\,$\mu$m. Each pixel signal is read out independently, enabling single-photon detection. After successfully observing the Crab pulsar using two Japanese telescopes, we upgraded the readout boards to achieve a more compact and stable system. The new system incorporates an analog application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed at KEK for multi-purpose fast readout for silicon photomultipliers. This ASIC features a fast transimpedance amplifier and a comparator, independently processing 16 channels. A Global Navigation Satellite System receiver and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) provide timestamps for each detected photon with a resolution of 100 ns. The FPGA transmits the acquired data to a PC via Ethernet. This paper presents the details of the new system and the results of its initial evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charged particles are tracked in the high energy physics detectors to provide the information of their properties. One of the tracking detector is straw tube detector that has been used by many experiments. The motivation behind the current work is to study the primary ionization and particle identification using straw tube detectors. Additionally, we report the decay of $^{60}$CO for the study of gamma peaks since these are used in cobalt therapy, that is beneficial for cancer/tumor treatment. The various studies like primary ionization, spatial co-ordinate distributions in the different gas mixtures, transition radiation, drift velocities of electrons and diffusion coefficients using different xenon-based gas mixtures have been obtained. These studies have been done after the optimization of xenon-based gas mixtures for a deeper understanding. The gas mixture that shows maximum transition radiation among the xenon-based gas mixtures was found to be $Xe:He:CH_{4}$ :: 30:55:15. The gas mixture that posses maximum primary ionization has been observed to be $Xe:CO_{2}$ :: 70:30. Finally, the simulations have been carried out for the particle identification in the straw tube detectors with different particles i.e., muons, pions and kaons.</description>

      <title>All Electrical Near-Zero Field Magnetoresistance Magnetometry up to 500 {\deg}C Using SiC Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide is renowned for its exceptional thermal stability, making it a crucial material for high-temperature power devices in extreme environments. While optically detected magnetic resonance in SiC has been widely studied for magnetometry, it requires complex setups involving optical and microwave sources. Similarly, electrically detected magnetic resonance in SiC, which relies on an electrical readout of spin resonance, has also been explored for magnetometry. However, both techniques require microwave excitation, which limits their scalability. In contrast, SiC's spin-dependent recombination currents enable a purely electrical approach to magnetometry through the near-zero field magnetoresistance effect, where the device resistance changes in response to small magnetic fields. Despite its potential, NZFMR remains underexplored for high-temperature applications. In this work, we demonstrate the use of NZFMR in SiC diodes for high-temperature relative magnetometry and achieve sensitive detection of weak magnetic fields at temperatures up to 500 {\deg}C. Our technology provides a simple and cost-effective alternative to other magnetometry architectures, eliminating the need for a microwave source or complex setup. The NZFMR signal is modulated by an external magnetic field, which alters the singlet-triplet pair ratio controlled by hyperfine interactions between nuclear and electron/hole spins, as well as dipole-dipole/exchange interactions between electron and hole spins, providing a novel mechanism for relative magnetometry sensing at elevated temperatures. A critical advantage of our approach is the sensor head's low power consumption, which is less than 0.5 W at 500 {\deg}C for magnetic fields below 5 Gauss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state systems. We present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enabling comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Development and Benchmarking of JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments measuring fission observables encounter false coincidences arising from timing overlap of separate fission product decays. Simulations of both fission observables and particles in detector systems exist, but have not yet been combined to produce accurate event-by-event outputs in a time-dependent manner. Geant4 is a powerful simulation tool for nuclear physics studies, but it does not handle multiple initial particles in a single simulation instance, nor does it feature high fidelity fission sampling. JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool has been developed to address this challenge. The tool utilizes simulated fission data from an external program in conjunction with Geant4, which has been modified to produce a single timeline of events over an entire simulated experiment. The physical accuracy of the simulated overlapping energy depositions within detectors has been verified via simulation of fission products from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <title>The influence of pixel cell layout on the timing performance of 3D sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) pixel sensors are a promising technology for implementing the 4D-tracking paradigm in high-radiation environments. Despite their advantages in radiation tolerance, 3D pixel sensors exhibit non-uniform electric and weighting fields that can degrade timing performance. This study explores the impact of pixel cell geometry on the timing characteristics of 3D columnar-electrode sensors fabricated by IMB-CNM, comparing square and hexagonal layouts. The sensors were characterized using the Two-Photon Absorption Transient Current Technique (TPA-TCT), providing high-resolution three-dimensional maps of the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) of charge carriers. Measurements at multiple depths and bias voltages reveal that the square geometry yields a more uniform temporal response compared to the hexagonal configuration. Additionally, a novel TPA-TCT-based method was introduced to determine the sensor jitter, relying on the analysis of the time difference between consecutive pulses in the TPA-TCT pulse train acquired under identical conditions. These findings underline the importance of pixel design optimization for future 4D-tracking detectors and confirm the TPA-TCT method as a powerful tool for detailed timing characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive comparison of linear amplifiers and microwave photon-counters in axion dark matter experiments. The study is done assuming a range of realistic operating conditions and detector parameters, over the frequency range between 1--30 GHz. As expected, photon counters are found to be advantageous under low background, at high frequencies ($\nu&gt;$ 5 GHz), if they can be implemented with robust wide-frequency tuning or a very low dark count rate. Additional noteworthy observations emerging from this study include: (1) an expanded applicability of off-resonance photon background reduction, including the single-quadrature state squeezing, for scan rate enhancements; (2) a much broader appeal for operating the haloscope resonators in the over-coupling regime, up to $\beta\sim 10$; (3) the need for a detailed investigation into the cryogenic and electromagnetic conditions inside haloscope cavities to lower the photon temperature for future experiments; (4) the necessity to develop a distributed network of coupling ports in high-volume axion haloscopes to utilize these potential gains in the scan rate.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T&lt;100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</description>
