      <title>Simopt -- Simulation pass for Speculative Optimisation of FPGA-CAD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioural simulation is deployed in CAD flow to verify the functional correctness of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. Metadata extracted from behavioural simulation could be used to optimise and/or speed up subsequent steps in the hardware design flow. In this paper, we propose Simopt, a tool flow that extracts simulation metadata to improve the timing performance of the design by introducing latency awareness during the placement phase and subsequently improving the routing time of the post-placed netlist using vendor tools. For our experiments, we adapt the open-source Yosys flow to perform Simopt-aware placement. Our results show that using the Simopt-pass in the design implementation flow results in up to 38.2% reduction in timing performance (latency) of the design.</description>

      <title>Entanglement buffering with two quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks crucially rely on the availability of high-quality entangled pairs of qubits, known as entangled links, distributed across distant nodes. Maintaining the quality of these links is a challenging task due to the presence of time-dependent noise, also known as decoherence. Entanglement purification protocols offer a solution by converting multiple low-quality entangled states into a smaller number of higher-quality ones. In this work, we introduce a framework to analyse the performance of entanglement buffering setups that combine entanglement consumption, decoherence, and entanglement purification. We propose two key metrics: the availability, which is the steady-state probability that an entangled link is present, and the average consumed fidelity, which quantifies the steady-state quality of consumed links. We then investigate a two-node system, where each node possesses two quantum memories: one for long-term entanglement storage, and another for entanglement generation. We model this setup as a continuous-time stochastic process and derive analytical expressions for the performance metrics. Our findings unveil a trade-off between the availability and the average consumed fidelity. We also bound these performance metrics for a buffering system that employs the well-known bilocal Clifford purification protocols. Importantly, our analysis demonstrates that, in the presence of noise, consistently purifying the buffered entanglement increases the average consumed fidelity, even when some buffered entanglement is discarded due to purification failures.</description>
