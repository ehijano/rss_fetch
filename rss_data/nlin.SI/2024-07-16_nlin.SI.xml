      <title>Stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials, and discrete Painlev\'{e}-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlev\'{e}-type (d-P-type) equations. We successfully apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations, along with their solutions and associated Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the d-P-type equation related to the Cauchy biorthogonality can be viewed as a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the d-P-type equation related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and this equation is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.</description>

      <title>R-matrix for the XX spin chain at the special imaginary value of staggered magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is pointed, that the $16\times16$ Hamiltonian density matrix, corresponding to XX spin chain in a staggered magnetic field, satisfies the Reshetikhin condition as well, as the two higher ones. All of them are necessary for the existence of the corresponding $R$-matrix. At the special imaginary value of the staggered field, the $R$-matrix is obtained explicitly. It is shown that the corresponding Hamiltonian has purely imaginary spectrum.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions which allow one to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a (Miura-type) discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. We present several new integrable equations connected by new discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations.</description>
