      <title>Follow-Your-MultiPose: Tuning-Free Multi-Character Text-to-Video Generation via Pose Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-editable and pose-controllable character video generation is a challenging but prevailing topic with practical applications. However, existing approaches mainly focus on single-object video generation with pose guidance, ignoring the realistic situation that multi-character appear concurrently in a scenario. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-character video generation framework in a tuning-free manner, which is based on the separated text and pose guidance. Specifically, we first extract character masks from the pose sequence to identify the spatial position for each generating character, and then single prompts for each character are obtained with LLMs for precise text guidance. Moreover, the spatial-aligned cross attention and multi-branch control module are proposed to generate fine grained controllable multi-character video. The visualized results of generating video demonstrate the precise controllability of our method for multi-character generation. We also verify the generality of our method by applying it to various personalized T2I models. Moreover, the quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared with previous works.</description>

      <title>Improving Lip-synchrony in Direct Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation typically prioritizes improving translation quality and naturalness. However, an equally critical aspect in audio-visual content is lip-synchrony-ensuring that the movements of the lips match the spoken content-essential for maintaining realism in dubbed videos. Despite its importance, the inclusion of lip-synchrony constraints in AVS2S models has been largely overlooked. This study addresses this gap by integrating a lip-synchrony loss into the training process of AVS2S models. Our proposed method significantly enhances lip-synchrony in direct audio-visual speech-to-speech translation, achieving an average LSE-D score of 10.67, representing a 9.2% reduction in LSE-D over a strong baseline across four language pairs. Additionally, it maintains the naturalness and high quality of the translated speech when overlaid onto the original video, without any degradation in translation quality.</description>

      <title>L3TC: Leveraging RWKV for Learned Lossless Low-Complexity Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48\% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, \emph{L3TC} offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a $50\times$ reduction in model parameters. More importantly, \emph{L3TC} is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second.</description>

      <title>SoundLoc3D: Invisible 3D Sound Source Localization and Classification Using a Multimodal RGB-D Acoustic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D sound sources and estimating their semantic labels -- where the sources may not be visible, but are assumed to lie on the physical surface of objects in the scene -- have many real applications, including detecting gas leak and machinery malfunction. The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</description>

      <title>AV-DTEC: Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Fusion for Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of compact UAVs has created significant threats to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we propose AV-DTEC, a lightweight self-supervised audio-visual fusion-based anti-UAV system. AV-DTEC is trained using self-supervised learning with labels generated by LiDAR, and it simultaneously learns audio and visual features through a parallel selective state-space model. With the learned features, a specially designed plug-and-play primary-auxiliary feature enhancement module integrates visual features into audio features for better robustness in cross-lighting conditions. To reduce reliance on auxiliary features and align modalities, we propose a teacher-student model that adaptively adjusts the weighting of visual features. AV-DTEC demonstrates exceptional accuracy and effectiveness in real-world multi-modality data. The code and trained models are publicly accessible on GitHub

      <title>Linguistics-Vision Monotonic Consistent Network for Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate sign videos corresponding to spoken language sentences, where the conversion of sign Glosses to Poses (G2P) is the key step. Due to the cross-modal semantic gap and the lack of word-action correspondence labels for strong supervision alignment, the SLP suffers huge challenges in linguistics-vision consistency. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based Linguistics-Vision Monotonic Consistent Network (LVMCN) for SLP, which constrains fine-grained cross-modal monotonic alignment and coarse-grained multimodal semantic consistency in language-visual cues through Cross-modal Semantic Aligner (CSA) and Multimodal Semantic Comparator (MSC). In the CSA, we constrain the implicit alignment between corresponding gloss and pose sequences by computing the cosine similarity association matrix between cross-modal feature sequences (i.e., the order consistency of fine-grained sign glosses and actions). As for MSC, we construct multimodal triplets based on paired and unpaired samples in batch data. By pulling closer the corresponding text-visual pairs and pushing apart the non-corresponding text-visual pairs, we constrain the semantic co-occurrence degree between corresponding gloss and pose sequences (i.e., the semantic consistency of coarse-grained textual sentences and sign videos). Extensive experiments on the popular PHOENIX14T benchmark show that the LVMCN outperforms the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>InterDance:Reactive 3D Dance Generation with Realistic Duet Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans perform a variety of interactive motions, among which duet dance is one of the most challenging interactions. However, in terms of human motion generative models, existing works are still unable to generate high-quality interactive motions, especially in the field of duet dance. On the one hand, it is due to the lack of large-scale high-quality datasets. On the other hand, it arises from the incomplete representation of interactive motion and the lack of fine-grained optimization of interactions. To address these challenges, we propose, InterDance, a large-scale duet dance dataset that significantly enhances motion quality, data scale, and the variety of dance genres. Built upon this dataset, we propose a new motion representation that can accurately and comprehensively describe interactive motion. We further introduce a diffusion-based framework with an interaction refinement guidance strategy to optimize the realism of interactions progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and algorithm.</description>

      <title>Modular Conversational Agents for Surveys and Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surveys and interviews (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured) are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by large language models (LLMs). However, as public investments and policies on infrastructure and services often involve substantial public stakes and environmental risks, there is a need for a rigorous, transparent, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient development framework tailored for such major decision-making processes. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resultant parameterized process for designing conversational agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic in the proposed approach. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) transportation expert consultation about future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript post-processing. The results show the effectiveness of this modular approach and how it addresses key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns, setting the stage for the next-generation surveys and interviews.</description>

      <title>Modality-Aware Shot Relating and Comparing for Video Scene Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video scene detection involves assessing whether each shot and its surroundings belong to the same scene. Achieving this requires meticulously correlating multi-modal cues, $\it{e.g.}$ visual entity and place modalities, among shots and comparing semantic changes around each shot. However, most methods treat multi-modal semantics equally and do not examine contextual differences between the two sides of a shot, leading to sub-optimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose the $\bf{M}$odality-$\bf{A}$ware $\bf{S}$hot $\bf{R}$elating and $\bf{C}$omparing approach (MASRC), which enables relating shots per their own characteristics of visual entity and place modalities, as well as comparing multi-shots similarities to have scene changes explicitly encoded. Specifically, to fully harness the potential of visual entity and place modalities in modeling shot relations, we mine long-term shot correlations from entity semantics while simultaneously revealing short-term shot correlations from place semantics. In this way, we can learn distinctive shot features that consolidate coherence within scenes and amplify distinguishability across scenes. Once equipped with distinctive shot features, we further encode the relations between preceding and succeeding shots of each target shot by similarity convolution, aiding in the identification of scene ending shots. We validate the broad applicability of the proposed components in MASRC. Extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MASRC significantly advances video scene detection.</description>

      <title>VidCtx: Context-aware Video Question Answering with Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR.</description>

      <title>Predicting Satisfied User and Machine Ratio for Compressed Images: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, high-quality images are pursued by both humans for better viewing experience and by machines for more accurate visual analysis. However, images are usually compressed before being consumed, decreasing their quality. It is meaningful to predict the perceptual quality of compressed images for both humans and machines, which guides the optimization for compression. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to address this. Specifically, we create a deep learning-based model to predict Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) and Satisfied Machine Ratio (SMR) of compressed images simultaneously. We first pre-train a feature extractor network on a large-scale SMR-annotated dataset with human perception-related quality labels generated by diverse image quality models, which simulates the acquisition of SUR labels. Then, we propose an MLP-Mixer-based network to predict SUR and SMR by leveraging and fusing the extracted multi-layer features. We introduce a Difference Feature Residual Learning (DFRL) module to learn more discriminative difference features. We further use a Multi-Head Attention Aggregation and Pooling (MHAAP) layer to aggregate difference features and reduce their redundancy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SUR and SMR prediction methods. Moreover, our joint learning scheme of human and machine perceptual quality prediction tasks is effective at improving the performance of both.</description>

      <title>ANID: How Far Are We? Evaluating the Discrepancies Between AI-synthesized Images and Natural Images through Multimodal Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), one of the key challenges is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the remarkable capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling images, significant discrepancies remain when these images are compared to natural ones. To systematically investigate and quantify these discrepancies, we introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy Evaluation benchmark aimed at addressing the critical question: \textit{how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images?} We have constructed a large-scale multimodal dataset, the Distinguishing Natural and AI-generated Images (DNAI) dataset, which includes over 440,000 AIGI samples generated by 8 representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, such as Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text \textit{vs.} Image-to-Image (TI2I). Our fine-grained assessment framework provides a comprehensive evaluation of the DNAI dataset across five key dimensions: naive visual feature quality, semantic alignment in multimodal generation, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive evaluation results highlight significant discrepancies across these dimensions, underscoring the necessity of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a holistic understanding of AI-generated image quality.

      <description>arXiv:2412.17667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce VERSA, a unified and standardized evaluation toolkit designed for various speech, audio, and music signals. The toolkit features a Pythonic interface with flexible configuration and dependency control, making it user-friendly and efficient. With full installation, VERSA offers 63 metrics with 711 metric variations based on different configurations. These metrics encompass evaluations utilizing diverse external resources, including matching and non-matching reference audio, text transcriptions, and text captions. As a lightweight yet comprehensive toolkit, VERSA is versatile to support the evaluation of a wide range of downstream scenarios. To demonstrate its capabilities, this work highlights example use cases for VERSA, including audio coding, speech synthesis, speech enhancement, singing synthesis, and music generation.

      <title>Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</description>

      <title>Content Adaptive Front End For Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a learnable content adaptive front end for audio signal processing. Before the modern advent of deep learning, we used fixed representation non-learnable front-ends like spectrogram or mel-spectrogram with/without neural architectures. With convolutional architectures supporting various applications such as ASR and acoustic scene understanding, a shift to a learnable front ends occurred in which both the type of basis functions and the weight were learned from scratch and optimized for the particular task of interest. With the shift to transformer-based architectures with no convolutional blocks present, a linear layer projects small waveform patches onto a small latent dimension before feeding them to a transformer architecture. In this work, we propose a way of computing a content-adaptive learnable time-frequency representation. We pass each audio signal through a bank of convolutional filters, each giving a fixed-dimensional vector. It is akin to learning a bank of finite impulse-response filterbanks and passing the input signal through the optimum filter bank depending on the content of the input signal. A content-adaptive learnable time-frequency representation may be more broadly applicable, beyond the experiments in this paper.</description>

      <title>VIoTGPT: Learning to Schedule Vision Tools in LLMs towards Intelligent Video Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Internet of Things (VIoT) has shown full potential in collecting an unprecedented volume of video data. How to schedule the domain-specific perceiving models and analyze the collected videos uniformly, efficiently, and especially intelligently to accomplish complicated tasks is challenging. To address the challenge, we build VIoTGPT, the framework based on LLMs to correctly interact with humans, query knowledge videos, and invoke vision models to analyze multimedia data collaboratively. To support VIoTGPT and related future works, we meticulously crafted the VIoT-Tool dataset, including the training dataset and the benchmark involving 11 representative vision models across three categories based on semi-automatic annotations. To guide LLM to act as the intelligent agent towards intelligent VIoT, we resort to the ReAct instruction tuning method based on VIoT-Tool to learn the tool capability. Quantitative and qualitative experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of VIoTGPT. We believe VIoTGPT contributes to improving human-centered experiences in VIoT applications.

      <title>Reviewing Intelligent Cinematography: AI research for camera-based video production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers the first comprehensive review of artificial intelligence (AI) research in the context of real camera content acquisition for entertainment purposes and is aimed at both researchers and cinematographers. Addressing the lack of review papers in the field of intelligent cinematography} (IC) and the breadth of related computer vision research, we present a holistic view of the IC landscape while providing technical insight, important for experts across disciplines. We provide technical background on generative AI, object detection, automated camera calibration and 3-D content acquisition, with references to assist non-technical readers. The application sections categorize work in terms of four production types: General Production, Virtual Production, Live Production and Aerial Production. Within each application section, we (1) sub-classify work according to research topic and (2) describe the trends and challenges relevant to each type of production. In the final chapter, we address the greater scope of IC research and summarize the significant potential of this area to influence the creative industries sector. We suggest that work relating to virtual production has the greatest potential to impact other mediums of production, driven by the growing interest in LED volumes/stages for in-camera virtual effects (ICVFX) and automated 3-D capture for virtual modeling of real world scenes and actors. We also address ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of creative AI that impact on artists, actors, technologists and the general public.</description>

      <title>One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying Multimodal Tasks with LLM Neural-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>Webcam-based Pupil Diameter Prediction Benefits from Upscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing pupil diameter is essential for assessing psychological and physiological states such as stress levels and cognitive load. However, the low resolution of images in eye datasets often hampers precise measurement. This study evaluates the impact of various upscaling methods, ranging from bicubic interpolation to advanced super-resolution, on pupil diameter predictions. We compare several pre-trained methods, including CodeFormer, GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN, HAT, and SRResNet. Our findings suggest that pupil diameter prediction models trained on upscaled datasets are highly sensitive to the selected upscaling method and scale. Our results demonstrate that upscaling methods consistently enhance the accuracy of pupil diameter prediction models, highlighting the importance of upscaling in pupilometry. Overall, our work provides valuable insights for selecting upscaling techniques, paving the way for more accurate assessments in psychological and physiological research.</description>

      <title>Hand1000: Generating Realistic Hands from Text with Only 1,000 Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements in recent years, aiming to produce realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</description>

      <title>PolySmart @ TRECVid 2024 Video-To-Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our methods and results for the Video-To-Text (VTT) task at TRECVid 2024, exploring the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT-Video in generating natural language descriptions for video content. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning VLMs on VTT datasets to enhance description accuracy, contextual relevance, and linguistic consistency. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning substantially improves the model's ability to produce more detailed and domain-aligned text, bridging the gap between generic VLM tasks and the specialized needs of VTT. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model outperforms baseline VLMs across various evaluation metrics, underscoring the importance of domain-specific tuning for complex VTT tasks.</description>
