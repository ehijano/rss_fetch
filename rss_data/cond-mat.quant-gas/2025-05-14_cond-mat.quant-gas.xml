      <title>Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase alignment in a lattice of exciton-polaritonic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by means of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation including non-Markovian coupling to the excitonic reservoir. Attention is concentrated on properties of the condensate lattice created by laser beams providing incoherent pumping of the reservoir. It is shown that phase ordering of the lattice depends on temperature. The crossover between the in-phase (``ferromagnetic'') and the checkboard (``antiferromagnetic'') orders is accompanied by variation of the steady-state condensate density. Also it is shown that the condensate lattices can retain ordered pattern for temperatures which are much higher than the critical temperature of a single spot, probably due to suppression of the modulational instability.</description>

      <title>Observation of high partial-wave Feshbach resonances in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the new observation of several high partial-wave (HPW) magnetic Feshbach resonances (FRs) in $^{39}$K atoms of the hyperfine substate $\left|F=1,m_{F}=-1\right\rangle$. These resonances locate at the region between two broad $s$-wave FRs from 32.6 G to 162.8 G, in which Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be produced with tunable positive scattering length obtained by magnetic FRs. These HPW FRs are induced by the dipolar spin-spin interaction with s-wave in the open channel and HPW in the closed channel. Therefore, these HPW FRs have distinct characteristics in temperature dependence and loss line shape from that induced by spin-exchange interaction with HPWs in both open and closed channels. Among these resonances, one $d$-wave and two $g$-wave FRs are confirmed by the multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT) calculation. The HPW FRs have significant applications in many-body physics dominated by HPW pairing.</description>

      <title>Extreme Loss Suppression and Wide Tunability of Dipolar Interactions in an Ultracold Molecular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Bang-bang preparation of a quantum many-body ground state in a finite lattice: optimization of the algorithm with a tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a lattice quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Engineering long-range and multi-body interactions via global kinetic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range and multi-body interactions are crucial for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Yet, their practical realization using elementary pairwise interactions remains an outstanding challenge. We propose an experimental scheme based on the Bose-Hubbard system with a periodic driving of the on-site energy and global-range density-density interactions, a setup readily implementable via cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity-mediated interactions. Optimally chosen driving parameters can induce global kinetic constraints, where tunneling rates are selectively suppressed depending on the particle number imbalance between all even and odd sites. This mechanism, together with the flexible tunability of local tunneling rates, provides efficient implementation schemes of a family of global controlled gates for quantum computation. We illustrate this scheme for the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, circumventing the need for a two-body gate decomposition, and elaborate on the efficient preparation of entangled many-body states.</description>

      <title>Observation of generalized t-J spin dynamics with tunable dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</description>
