      <title>Electronic Structure Theory with Molecular Point Group Symmetries on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry through major speedups to computation times and exponential reduction of computational resources. Here, we combine the symmetry-adapted Jordan-Wigner encoding based on the full Boolean symmetry group $\mathbb{Z}_2^k$ with our new implementation of the Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) method for improving the efficiency of electronic structure theory calculations on quantum annealers, particularly by reducing the number of qubits needed to achieve the same accuracy. By providing a more extensive symmetry-adapted encoding (SAE) than previous work, we are able to simulate molecules larger than those previously reported that have been studied using methods developed for quantum annealers and without using an active space. We calculated the potential energy surfaces of H$_2$, LiH, He$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_2$, N$_2$, Li$_2$, F$_2$, CO, BH$_3$, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$, with the largest molecule in the STO-6G basis set requiring 16 qubits with our SAE, and compared them with full configuration interaction results. The application of SAE to the XBK method provides an exponential reduction of the size of the Hilbert space and scales well with the size of the problem. It does not introduce significant additional errors for even or large values of a key variational parameter that determines the number of ancilla qubits used in the XBK method's Hamiltonian embedding, or for certain molecules such as He$_2$ and H$_2$O. We provide an explanation for this behavior and a recommendation on the usage of our method.</description>

      <title>Emamectin benzoate sensing using vivianenes (2D vivianites)</title>

Abstract: The excessive application of pesticides, particularly the overreliance on insecticides for the protection of desirable crops from pests, has posed a significant threat to both ecological systems and human health due to environmental pollution. This research outlines a comprehensive approach to recognizing and quantifying the presence of insecticides through the application of spectroscopic and electrochemical sensing methods. The detection of Emamectin benzoate (EB), a commonly used insecticide, was performed utilizing vivianenes, a 2D phosphate that has been mechanically exfoliated from the naturally occurring vivianite minerals. This investigation examined the structural and compositional characteristics of vivianenes, utilizing a range of characterization methods. The spectroscopic analyses reveal the molecular interactions and structural modifications that take place during the interaction of EB with the 2D template. Electrochemical investigations employing cyclic voltammetry were performed for different concentrations of EB to enable real-time monitoring of the pesticide. The modified sensing electrode using vivianene demonstrated a linear range of from 50 mg/L to 10 micro g/L, effectively detecting EB molecules at levels significantly below the hazardous threshold. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out to obtain further insights into the interaction mechanisms of the EB with the vivianites, and the results corroborate the adsorption mechanism. Our results highlight the potential application of 2D phosphate minerals as advanced sensors to enhance agricultural monitoring and promote sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Functional-Group Coarse-Graining: A Deep Learning Framework for Molecular Prediction and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers considerable promise for the design of new molecules and materials. In real-world applications, the design problem is often domain-specific, and suffers from insufficient data, particularly labeled data, for ML training. In this study, we report a data-efficient, deep-learning framework for molecular discovery that integrates a coarse-grained functional-group representation with a self-attention mechanism to capture intricate chemical interactions. Our approach exploits group-contribution theory to create a graph-based intermediate representation of molecules, serving as a low-dimensional embedding that substantially reduces the data demands typically required for training. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism to learn subtle chemical context, our method consistently outperforms conventional methods in predicting multiple thermophysical properties. In a case study focused on adhesive polymer monomers, we train on a limited dataset comprising just 6,000 unlabeled and 600 labeled monomers. The resulting chemistry prediction model achieves over 92% accuracy in forecasting properties directly from SMILES strings, exceeding the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, the latent molecular embedding is invertible, allowing the design pipeline to incorporate a decoder that can automatically generate new monomers from the learned chemical subspace. We illustrate this functionality by targeting high and low glass transition temperatures ($T_g$), successfully identifying novel candidates whose $T_g$ extends beyond the range observed in the training data. The ease with which our coarse-grained, attention-based framework navigates both chemical diversity and data scarcity offers a compelling route to accelerate and broaden the search for functional materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO2 capture with pH-independent redox chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capture of anthropogenic CO2 is critical for mitigating climate change, and reducing the energy cost is essential for wide-scale deployment. Solubility of inorganic carbon in aqueous solutions depends on the pH, and electrochemical modulation of the pH has been investigated as a means of CO2 capture and release. However, reported methods incur unavoidable energy costs due to thermodynamic penalties. In this study, we introduce a pH-independent redox chemistry that greatly lowers the thermodynamic energy costs by changing the pH without directly changing the [H+]. We show that the redox reaction of TEMPO molecules modulates the pH for capture and release of CO2 in a flow cell with an energy cost as low as 2.6 kJ/mol of CO2 corresponding to 0.027 eV/molecule. A molecular model, supported by MD and DFT simulations, is proposed of how the pH is decreased by 7.6 while largely avoiding the entropic energy cost associated with increasing the [H+]. We believe that this work showcases the potential of pH-independent redox chemistries for practical and cost-effective CO2 capture.</description>

      <title>A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. In addition to the physical further work on this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Integrated plasmo-photonic sensor with voltage controled detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a waveguide-integrated interferometric sensor in which interference occurs between two plasmonic modes propagating in a single plasmonic waveguide. For the purpose of sensing, the vertical plasmonic slot waveguide was rearranged by increasing the distance between the metal electrodes. Consequently, the plasmonic modes associated with each metal electrode have been separated, enabling them to propagate independently on opposing edges of metal electrodes what allows for the implementation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The metal electrodes that support the plasmonic modes can also function as electrical contacts. By applying a DC voltage between them, it is possible to efficiently separate ions that drift to one of the metal electrodes. Consequently, any change in a transmission from the interferometer refers only to the amount of ions in a liquid as the output signal from the interferometer is normalized to a liquid by the reference arm which is in direct contact with the examined liquid solution. The total amount of ions in the examined liquid remains constant, however, what changes is their distribution in the gap as the ions drift toward one of the metal electrodes when a voltage is applied. The proposed configuration is highly sensitive to variations in transmission between the two arms of the interferometer, enabling a record sensitivity of over 12460 nm/RIU, even at the telecom wavelength of 1550 nm. A further enhancement in sensitivity is expected in the mid-infrared wavelengths, which correspond to the maximum absorption peaks of most chemical and biological compounds.</description>

      <title>FragmentNet: Adaptive Graph Fragmentation for Graph-to-Sequence Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction uses molecular structure to infer chemical properties. Chemically interpretable representations that capture meaningful intramolecular interactions enhance the usability and effectiveness of these predictions. However, existing methods often rely on atom-based or rule-based fragment tokenization, which can be chemically suboptimal and lack scalability. We introduce FragmentNet, a graph-to-sequence foundation model with an adaptive, learned tokenizer that decomposes molecular graphs into chemically valid fragments while preserving structural connectivity. FragmentNet integrates VQVAE-GCN for hierarchical fragment embeddings, spatial positional encodings for graph serialization, global molecular descriptors, and a transformer. Pre-trained with Masked Fragment Modeling and fine-tuned on MoleculeNet tasks, FragmentNet outperforms models with similarly scaled architectures and datasets while rivaling larger state-of-the-art models requiring significantly more resources. This novel framework enables adaptive decomposition, serialization, and reconstruction of molecular graphs, facilitating fragment-based editing and visualization of property trends in learned embeddings - a powerful tool for molecular design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Zepto to Attosecond core-level photoemission time delays in homonuclear diatomic molecules and non-dipole effects in the framework of Multiple Scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the angular distribution of core-level photoemission time delay within a molecular frame. This phenomenon can be measured with the advancement of attosecond pulsed lasers and metrology. Our focus is on homonuclear diatomic molecules. The two-center interference patterns observed in the gerade and ungerade core-level Molecular-Frame Photoelectron Angular Distributions (MFPAD) of homonuclear diatomic molecules demonstrate symmetry breaking with respect to the direction of light propagation, attributed to the non-dipole (multipole) effect. Our study delves into the photoemission time delay resulting from the non-dipole effect through the introduction of a theoretical model. We reveal that when considering the contributions from the gerade and ungerade delocalized states in incoherent sums, the two-center interference terms cancel each other in both the MFPADs and photoemission time delays. However, a residual term persists showcasing the non-dipole effect in the photoemission time delays. Furthermore, by expanding the scattering state of photoelectrons using the Multiple Scattering theory, we demonstrate the significant role played by the scattering of photoelectrons at the molecular potential in describing the photoemission time delays of homonuclear diatomic molecules. Next, we apply our theoretical model to a nitrogen molecule, demonstrating the energy- and angular-dependent characteristics of the MFPADs and photoemission time delays through both analytical and numerical approaches. The incoherent sums of the MFPADs in both forward and backward directions exhibit equal intensity, whereas the incoherent sums of the photoemission time delays show a slight variation of a few hundred zeptoseconds compared with numerical calculations using a multiple scattering code.</description>

      <title>Why Do Weak-Binding M-N-C Single-Atom Catalysts Possess Anomalously High Oxygen Reduction Activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) structures are widely recognized as promising candidates in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). According to the classical Sabatier principle, optimal 3d metal catalysts, such as Fe/Co-N-C, achieve superior catalytic performance due to the moderate binding strength. However, the substantial ORR activity demonstrated by weakly binding M-N-C catalysts such as NiCu-N-C challenges current understandings, emphasizing the need to explore new underlying mechanisms. In this work, we integrated a pH-field coupled microkinetic model with detailed experimental electron state analyses to verify a novel key step in the ORR reaction pathway of weak-binding SACs-the oxygen adsorption at the metal-N bridge site. This step significantly altered the adsorption scaling relations, electric field responses, and solvation effects, further impacting the key kinetic reaction barrier from HOO* to O* and pH-dependent performance. Synchrotron spectra analysis further provides evidence for the new weak-binding M-N-C model, showing an increase in electron density on the anti-bonding pi orbitals of N atoms in weak-binding M-N-C catalysts and confirming the presence of N-O bonds. These findings redefine the understanding of weak-binding M-N-C catalyst behavior, opening up new perspectives for their application in clean energy.</description>

      <title>Frozen natural spinors for Cholesky decomposition based two-component relativistic coupled cluster method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and cost-effective implementation for the exact two-component atomic mean field (X2CAMF) based coupled cluster (CC) method, which integrates frozen natural spinors (FNS) and the Cholesky decomposition (CD) technique. The use of CD approximation greatly reduces the storage requirement of the calculation without any significant reduction in accuracy. Compared to four-component methods, the FNS and CD-based X2CAMF-CC approach gives similar accuracy as that of the canonical four-component relativistic coupled cluster method at a fraction of the cost. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by the calculation of a medium-sized uranium complex involving the correlation of over 1000 virtual spinors.</description>

      <title>Partial Auger Decay Widths from Complex-Valued Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a new strategy to compute partial Auger decay widths with equation-of-motion ionisation-potential coupled-cluster (EOMIP-CCSD) wave functions in the framework of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where the decaying character of the metastable states is described via complex-scaled basis functions. While the total decay width can generally be obtained from the energy eigenvalues, the computation of partial decay widths, i. e. the contributions of channels to the total decay rate, governing their probability distribution, is less trivial. In the past, methods where channels are projected out during the EOMIP-CCSD iteration have been developed (Auger Channel Projector), but such a procedure requires to establish convergence of the excitation vector for each separately. Furthermore, they suffer from interaction between the channels upon perturbation of the wave function.
  In contrast, we suggest to compute the contribution of the two-electron transition that Auger decay implies, where two valence electrons are involved, one refilling the core hole and one emitted to the continuum, from the respective entries in the two-electron density matrix that describe the extent of this transition in the wave function upon application of correlation and excitation operator. In this way, we obtain all partial decay widths from wave functions determined in the full excitation manifold. The results from this approach compare very well to the Auger Channel Projector results: we compute spectra for K-edge ionised states of methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, and the cyanide anion, as well as Coster-Kronig spectra of L1-edge ionised hydrogen sulfide, which differ only negligibly between the two methods. A spectrum of the cyanide anion has not been reported before -- we discuss the selectivity of the decay process with respect to the initial state and the possibility of interatomic Auger decay.</description>

      <title>Graphs that predict exciton delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of molecular excitons and related supramolecular systems has largely focused on aggregates where nearest-neighbour couplings dominate. We propose that radically different states can be produced by moving beyond that paradigm. In practice, how to accomplish this task remains an open challenge because it requires development of ways to couple networks molecules more densely. In the present work we motivate why it would be worthwhile. We describe a merger of work developed in the field of discrete mathematics with concepts and needs for the field of molecular excitons. We discuss the reasons for exciton localization and posit how systems where the spectrum contains a gap can be robust to disorder, and thus maintain coherence, or delocalization. We propose that certain kinds of structures (expander graphs) specifying how molecules are coupled to each other, show such a gap and thus resilience to decoherence. We review relevant background known from graph theory. This perspective suggests a fascinating scope of new properties possible by demonstrating expander graph inspired excitonics.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Boltzmann Generators</title>

Abstract: The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Flow Is All You Need to Sample Out-of-Distribution Chemical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.</description>
