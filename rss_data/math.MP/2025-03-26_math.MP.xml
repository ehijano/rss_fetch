      <description>arXiv:2503.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the Euler--Poisson equation system in the case of cylindrical symmetry with the von Neumann--Sedov--Taylor type of self-similar Ansatz and present scaling solutions. We have analyzed the scenario governed by Chaplygin's equation of state, which has historically been studied as a unifying framework of dark fluid for dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic suppression of supersonic quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of strongly interacting quantum lattice gases, including the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on macroscopic particle clusters of size $\theta N$, with $\theta\in(0,1)$ and $N$ the total particle number, and we study the quantum probability that such a cluster is transported across a distance $r$ within time $t$. Conventional effective light cone arguments yield a bound of the form $\exp(v t-r)$. We report a substantially stronger bound $\exp(\theta N(vt-r))$, which provides exponential suppression that scales with system size. Our result establishes a universal dynamical principle: macroscopic suppression of supersonic macroscopic transport (MASSMAT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to perform a nonlinear stability analysis of the $(1+1)$-dimensional Nambu-Goto action gas models. The energy-Casimir method is employed to discuss in detail the Lyapunov stability of the Chaplygin and Born-Infeld models. Particular solutions are considered and their stability is studied in order to illustrate the application of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that for two inverse temperatures $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho_\beta)$ of the Gibbs state $\rho_\beta$ for a given Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies $S(\rho_{\beta_1}) \geq S(\rho_{\beta_2}) \iff \beta_{1} \leq \beta_{2}$. That is, von Neumann entropy is a monotonically increasing function of temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ultra-massive spacetimes exist also in 2 + 1 dimensions with a positive cosmological constant {\Lambda} &gt; 0. They can be created through the collapse of a spherical null dust shell. The exterior of the shell is then a Mess spacetime, that is to say a locally de Sitter spacetime that cannot be obtained as a quotient of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Number variance for homogeneous determinantal processes on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an abstract determinantal point process on a general non--elementary Gromov hyperbolic metric space governed by an orthogonal projection in the case when the space is homogeneous and the point process is invariant under isometries. We give a lower bound of the variance of the number of points inside a ball that is proportional to the volume of the ball. In particular, such point processes are never hyperuniform. Our result applies to the known examples of radial determinantal point processes on Cayley trees and on the standard hyperbolic spaces governed by Bergman projection kernels.</description>

      <title>Towards entropic uncertainty relations for non-regular Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Entropic Uncertainty Relations (EUR) result from inequalities that are intrinsic to the Hilbert space and its dual with no direct connection to the Canonical Commutation Relations. Bialynicky-Mielcisnky obtained them in \cite{bialynicki1975uncertainty} attending Hilbert spaces with a Lebesgue measure. The analysis of these EUR in the context of singular Hilbert spaces has not been addressed. Singular Hilbert spaces are widely used in scenarios where some discretization of the space (or spacetime) is considered, e.g., loop quantum gravity, loop quantum cosmology and polymer quantum mechanics. In this work, we present an overview of the essential literature background and the road map we plan to follow to obtain the EUR in polymer quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy estimates for the good-bad-ugly model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the equations that constitute the so-called good-bad-ugly model, whose nonlinearities are known to mimic those present in the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge. This relationship between ugly fields and good and bad ones stems from the fact that one can write the equation for the rescaled derivative of an ugly along an incoming null direction as a good or a bad equation depending on whether there are source terms or not. This provides a new interpretation of the logarithms of the radial coordinate that show up in expansions of solutions to ugly equations near null infinity. This furthermore allows us to use the Klainerman-Sobolev inequality for the standard wave equation on Cauchy slices to show uniform boundedness for the ugly equation. In the second part of this paper we perform a first order reduction of the ugly equation with given sources in flat space and we radially compactify the coordinates in order to show an energy estimate for that equation on hyperboloidal slices. This result is an important first step towards establishing energy estimates for the hyperboloidal initial value problem of the first order compactified Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>Support of the Brown measure of a family of free multiplicative Brownian motions with non-negative initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family $b_{s,\tau}$ of free multiplicative Brownian motions labeled by a real variance parameter $s$ and a complex covariance parameter $\tau$. We then consider the element $xb_{s,\tau}$, where $x$ is non-negative and freely independent of $b_{s,\tau}$. Our goal is to identify the support of the Brown measure of $xb_{s,\tau}$. In the case $\tau =s$, we identify a region $\Sigma_s$ such that the Brown measure is vanishing outside of $\overline{\Sigma}_s$ except possibly at the origin. For general values of $\tau$, we construct a map $f_{s-\tau}$ and define $D_{s,\tau}$ as the complement of $f_{s-\tau}(\overline{\Sigma}_s^c)$. Then the Brown measure is zero outside $D_{s,\tau}$ except possibly at the origin. The proof of these results is based on a two-stage PDE analysis, using one PDE (following the work of Driver, Hall, and Kemp) for the case $\tau=s$ and a different PDE (following the work of Hall and Ho) to deform the $\tau=s$ case to general values of $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Variational Collision Integrators for Nonholonomic Lagrangian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A discrete theory for implicit nonholonomic Lagrangian systems undergoing elastic collisions is developed. It is based on the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert-Pontryagin variational principle and the dynamical equations thus obtained are the discrete nonholonomic implicit Euler-Lagrange equations together with the discrete conditions for the elastic impact. To illustrate the theory, variational integrators with collisions are built for several examples, including a bouncing ellipse and a nonholonomic spherical pendulum evolving inside a cylinder.</description>

      <title>The fibered rotation number for ergodic symplectic cocycles and its applications: I. Gap Labelling Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ (\Theta,T,\mu) $ be an ergodic topological dynamical system. The fibered rotation number for cocycles in $ \Theta\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) $, acting on $ \Theta\times \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1
  $ is well-defined and has wide applications in the study of the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. In this paper, we will provide its natural generalization for higher dimensional cocycles in $ \Theta\times\mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ or $ \Theta\times \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $, where $ \mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ and $ \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $ respectively refer to the $ 2m $-dimensional symplectic or Hermitian-symplectic matrices. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the integrated density of states for generalized Schr\"odinger operators and the fibered rotation number; and the Gap Labelling Theorem via the Schwartzman group, as expected from the one dimensional case [AS1983, JM1982].</description>

Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to symmetry defects and fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a superselection theory of symmetry defects in 2+1D symmetry enriched topological (SET) order in the infinite volume setting. For a finite symmetry group $G$ with a unitary on-site action, our formalism produces a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $G\mathsf{Sec}$. This superselection theory is a direct generalization of the usual superselection theory of anyons, and thus is consistent with this standard analysis in the trivially graded component $G\mathsf{Sec}_1$. This framework also gives us a completely rigorous understanding of symmetry fractionalization. To demonstrate the utility of our formalism, we compute $G\mathsf{Sec}$ explicitly in both short-range and long-range entangled spin systems with symmetry and recover the relevant skeletal data.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On the Lee-Yang property of some ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Lieb-Sokal theorem, the partition function, $Z$, of a ferromagnetic spin model has the Lee-Yang property if the single-spin partition function has it. In this note, it is shown that for some spin models a ferromagnetic interaction can induce the Lee-Yang property of $Z$ even if the single-spin partition function fails to have it. In particular, this holds for the Blume-Capel model and for the annealed states of the $s=\pm 1$ site dilute Ising model with a neares-neighbor interaction on $\mathds{Z}^d$, as well as with interactions defined by a hierarchical structure similar to that of Dyson's hierarchical model.</description>

      <title>Topological description of pure invariant states of the Weyl $C^*$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the topology of certain families of states of the Weyl $C^*$-algebra with finite degrees of freedom. We focus on families of pure states characterized by symmetries and a (semi-)regularity condition, and obtain precise topological descriptions through homeomorphisms with other explicit spaces. Of special importance are the families of pure, semi-regular states invariant under either continuous (plane-wave states) or discrete (Bloch-wave states) spatial translations, and the family of states invariant under discrete, mutually commuting spatial and momentum translations (Zak-wave states), all of which we completely characterize.</description>

      <title>Are Pseudo-Hermiticity and Generalized PT-Symmetry Equivalent at Exceptional Points?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized PT-symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. We show that this equivalence is generally valid for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. In particular, we establish the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for arbitrary linear operators acting in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Permutons, meanders, and SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of random permutons which can be constructed from a pair of space-filling Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curves on a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface. This class includes the skew Brownian permutons introduced by Borga (2021), which describe the scaling limit of various types of random pattern-avoiding permutations. Another interesting permuton in our class is the meandric permuton, which corresponds to two independent SLE$_8$ curves on a $\gamma$-LQG surface with $\gamma = \sqrt{\frac13 \left( 17 - \sqrt{145} \right)}$. Building on work by Di Francesco, Golinelli, and Guitter (2000), we conjecture that the meandric permuton describes the scaling limit of uniform meandric permutations, i.e., the permutations induced by a simple loop in the plane which crosses a line a specified number of times.
  We show that for any sequence of random permutations which converges to one of the above random permutons, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is sublinear. This proves that the length of the longest increasing subsequence is sublinear for Baxter, strong-Baxter, and semi-Baxter permutations and leads to the conjecture that the same is true for meandric permutations. We also prove that the closed support of each of the random permutons in our class has Hausdorff dimension one. Finally, we prove a re-rooting invariance property for the meandric permuton and write down a formula for its expected pattern densities in terms of LQG correlation functions (which are known explicitly) and the probability that an SLE$_8$ hits a given set of points in numerical order (which is not known explicitly). We conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>The $D^6 R^4$ interaction as a Poincar\'e series, and a related shifted convolution sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete the program, initiated in a 2015 paper of Green, Miller, and Vanhove, of directly constructing the automorphic solution to the string theory $D^6 R^4$ differential equation $(\Delta-12)f=-E_{3/2}^2$ for $SL(2,\Z)$. The construction is via a type of Poincar\'e series, and requires explicitly evaluating a particular double integral. We also show how to use double Dirichlet series to formally derive the predicted vanishing of one type of term appearing in $f$'s Fourier expansion, confirming a conjecture made by Chester, Green, Pufu, Wang, and Wen motivated by Yang-Mills theory (and later proved rigorously by Fedosova, Klinger-Logan, and Radchenko using the Gross-Zagier Holomorphic Projection Lemma.).</description>

      <title>Operational Quantum Reference Frame Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reference frames are needed in quantum theory for much the same reasons that reference frames are in classical theories: to manifest invariance in line with fundamental relativity principles and to provide a basis for the definition of observable quantities. Though around since the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the means for transforming descriptions between different quantum reference frames been tackled in detail. In this work, we provide a general, operationally motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations, holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which quantum states that cannot be physically distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of relative observables as a subspace of the algebra of invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of relative states is constructed through the identification of states which cannot be distinguished by relative observables. Through the notion of framed observables -- the formation of joint observables of system and frame -- of which the relative observables can be understood as examples, quantum reference frame transformations are then maps between equivalence classes of relative states which respect the framing. We give an explicit realisation in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a number of ways, and weakens claims of entanglement generation through frame changes.</description>

      <title>Physics with non-unital algebras? An invitation to the Okubo algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents some preliminary discussion on the possible relevance of the Okubonions, i.e. the real Okubo algebra $\mathcal{O}$, in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The Okubo algebra lacks a unit element and sits in the adjoint representation of its automorphism group $\text{SU}_{\mathcal{O}}$, thus being fundamentally different from the better-known octonions $\mathbb{O}$. While these latter may represent quarks (and color singlets), the Okubonions are conjectured to represent the gluons, i.e. the gauge bosons of the QCD $\text{SU}(3)$ color symmetry. However, it is shown that the $\text{SU}(3)$ groups pertaining to Okubonions and octonions are distinct and inequivalent subgroups of $Spin(8)$ that share no common $\text{SU}(2)$ subgroup. The unusual properties of Okubonions may be related to peculiar QCD phenomena like asymptotic freedom and color confinement, though the actual mechanisms remain to be investigated.</description>

      <title>The non-semisimple Kazhdan-Lusztig category for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at admissible levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Kazhdan and Lusztig's category $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of modules for the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2$ at an admissible level $k$, equivalently the category of finite-length grading-restricted generalized modules for the universal affine vertex operator algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, is a braided tensor category. Although this tensor category is not rigid, we show that the subcategory of all rigid objects in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is equal to the subcategory of all projective objects, and that every simple module in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ has a projective cover. Moreover, we show that the full subcategory of projective objects in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is monoidal equivalent to the category of tilting modules for quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at the root of unity $\zeta=e^{\pi i/(k+2)}$. Using this, we establish a universal property of the tensor category $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and as an application, we prove a weak Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence, that is, we obtain an exact essentially surjective (but not full or faithful) tensor functor from $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ to the category of finite dimensional weight modules for the quantum group associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at the root of unity $\zeta $. We also use the universal property to classify the categories $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ up to (braided) tensor equivalence and to obtain a tensor-categorical version of quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, that is, we construct a braided tensor functor from $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ to a category of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $1-\frac{6(k+1)^2}{k+2}$.</description>

      <title>Gluing invariants of Donaldson--Thomas type -- Part I: the Darboux stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a (-1)-shifted symplectic derived Deligne--Mumford stack. In this paper we introduce the Darboux stack of $X$, parametrizing local presentations of $X$ as a derived critical locus of a function $f$ on a smooth formal scheme $U$. Local invariants such as the Milnor number $\mu_f$, the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles $\mathsf{P}_{U,f}$ and the category of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ are naturally defined on the Darboux stack, without ambiguity. The stack of non-degenerate flat quadratic bundles acts on the Darboux stack and our main theorem is the contractibility of the quotient stack when taking a further homotopy quotient identifying isotopic automorphisms. As a corollary we recover the gluing results for vanishing cycles by Brav--Bussi--Dupont--Joyce--Szendr\H oi. In a second part (to appear), we will apply this general mechanism to glue the motives of the locally defined categories of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ under the prescription of additional orientation data, thus answering positively conjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin symmetry in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda conformal field theory I: Ward identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is the first of a two-part series dedicated to studying the symmetries enjoyed by the probabilistic construction of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely in the present document we show that this model enjoys higher-spin symmetry in the form of Ward identities, both local and global. To do so we consider the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda theory on the upper-half plane and rigorously define the descendant fields associated to the Vertex Operators. We then show that we can express local as well as global Ward identities based on them, for both the stress-energy tensor and the higher-spin current that encodes this enhanced level of symmetry. This answers a question raised in the physics literature as to whether Toda theory still enjoys higher-spin symmetry in the boundary case. The second part of this series will be dedicated to computing the singular vectors of the theory and showing that they give rise to higher equations of motion as well as, under additional assumptions, BPZ-type differential equations for the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representations and correlation functions of the first examples of 2D ground states with quantum phase transitions between area law and extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the correlation in the spin and color sectors from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, revealing additional characterizations of the exotic phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic Dirichlet to Neumann operator on the exterior of the disk -- diamagnetism, weak-magnetic field limit and flux effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (D-to-N map) $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ on the exterior of the disk with respect to a magnetic potential $A_{b, \nu}=A^b + A_\nu$ where, for $b\in \mathbb R$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$, $A^b (x,y)= b\, (-y, x)$ and $A_\nu (x,y)$ is the Aharonov-Bohm potential centered at the origin of flux $2\pi \nu$. First, we show that the limit of $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ as $b\rightarrow 0$ is equal to the D-to-N map $\widehat \Lambda (\nu)$ on the interior of the disk associated with the potential $A_\nu (x,y)$. Secondly, we study the ground state energy of the D-to-N map $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ and show that the strong diamagnetism property holds. Finally we slightly extend to the exterior case the asymptotic results obtained in the interior case for general domains.</description>
