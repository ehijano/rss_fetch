      <title>A Deterministic Bicriteria Approximation Algorithm for the Art Gallery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a polygon $H$ in the plane, the art gallery problem calls for fining the smallest set of points in $H$ from which every other point in $H$ is seen. We give a deterministic algorithm that, given any polygon $H$ with $h$ holes, $n$ rational veritces of maximum bit-length $L$, and a parameter $\delta \in(0,1)$, is guaranteed to find a set of points in $H$ of size $O\big(\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)\cdot\log (\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)))$ that sees at least a $(1-\delta)$-fraction of the area of the polygon. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in $h$, $n$, $L$ and $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where $\OPT$ is the size of an optimum solution.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Finite Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a functorial framework for persistent homology based on finite topological spaces and their associated posets. Starting from a finite metric space, we associate a filtration of finite topologies whose structure maps are continuous identity maps. By passing functorially to posets and to simplicial complexes via crosscut constructions, we obtain persistence modules without requiring inclusion relations between the resulting complexes. We show that standard poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and prove stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under perturbations of the input metric in a density-based instantiation.</description>

      <title>Complete and bi-continuous invariant of protein backbones under rigid motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins are large biomolecules that regulate all living organisms and consist of one or several chains. The primary structure of a protein chain is a sequence of amino acid residues whose three main atoms (alpha-carbon, nitrogen, and carbonyl carbon) form a protein backbone. The tertiary structure is the rigid shape of a protein chain represented by atomic positions in 3-dimensional space. Because different geometric structures often have distinct functional properties, it is important to continuously quantify differences in rigid shapes of protein backbones. Unfortunately, many widely used similarities of proteins fail axioms of a distance metric and discontinuously change under tiny perturbations of atoms.
  This paper develops a complete invariant that identifies any protein backbone in 3-dimensional space, uniquely under rigid motion. This invariant is Lipschitz bi-continuous in the sense that it changes up to a constant multiple of a maximum perturbation of atoms, and vice versa. The new invariant has been used to detect thousands of (near-)duplicates in the Protein Data Bank, whose presence inevitably skews machine learning predictions. The resulting invariant space allows low-dimensional maps with analytically defined coordinates that reveal substantial variability in the protein universe.</description>

      <title>Approximating mixed volumes to arbitrary accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating the mixed volume $V(P_1^{(\alpha_1)}, \dots, P_k^{(\alpha_k)})$ of an $k$-tuple of convex polytopes $(P_1, \dots, P_k)$, each of which is defined as the convex hull of at most $m_0$ points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We design an algorithm that produces an estimate that is within a multiplicative $1 \pm \epsilon$ factor of the true mixed volume with a probability greater than $1 - \delta.$ Let the constant $ \prod_{i=2}^{k} \frac{(\alpha_{i}+1)^{\alpha_{i}+1}}{\alpha_{i}^{\,\alpha_{i}}}$ be denoted by $\tilde{A}$. When each $P_i \subseteq B_\infty(2^L)$, we show in this paper that the time complexity of the algorithm is bounded above by a polynomial in $n, m_0, L, \tilde{A}, \epsilon^{-1}$ and $\log \delta^{-1}$. In fact, a stronger result is proved in this paper, with slightly more involved terminology.
  In particular, we provide the first randomized polynomial time algorithm for computing mixed volumes of such polytopes when $k$ is an absolute constant, but $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$ are arbitrary. Our approach synthesizes tools from convex optimization, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope subdivision.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Dynamic Computational Geometry with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the literature of computational geometry concerns geometric properties of sets of static points. M.J. Atallah introduced dynamic computational geometry, concerned with both momentary and long-term geometric properties of sets of moving point-objects. This area of research seems to have been dormant recently. The current paper examines new problems in dynamic computational geometry.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On The Computational Complexity of Minimum Aerial Photographs for Planar Region Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of drone technologies, aerial photography has become prevalent in many daily scenarios such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, law enforcement etc. A central challenge in this domain is the efficient coverage of a target area with photographs that can entirely capture the region, while respecting constraints such as the image resolution, and limited number of pictures that can be taken. This work investigates the computational complexity of covering a simple planar polygon using squares and circles. Specifically, it shows inapproximability gaps of $1.165$ (for squares) and $1.25$ (for restricted square centers) and develops a $2.828$-optimal approximation algorithm, demonstrating that these problems are computationally intractable to approximate. The intuitions of this work can extend beyond aerial photography to broader applications such as pesticide spraying and strategic sensor placement.</description>
