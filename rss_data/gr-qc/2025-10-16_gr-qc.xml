      <title>Radial kinks in the boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black holes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Wormhole Solutions in Unimodular Gravity: Energy Conditions and Exotic Matter Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper entitled Unimodular Gravity Traversable Wormholes by Agrawal et al. examined the properties of barotropic wormholes without tidal forces within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. Our analysis demonstrates that their conclusion regarding the possibility of sustaining such wormhole configurations with ordinary matter is not entirely accurate. We establish that exotic matter remains necessary for these wormhole solutions in Unimodular Gravity, in accordance with the long-established theoretical constraints already identified in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>On the Geometric Meaning of General Relativity and the Foundations of Newtonian Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric foundations of General Relativity are revisited, with particular attention to its gauge invariance, as a key to understanding the true nature of spacetime. Beyond the common image of spacetime as a deformable 'fabric' filling the Universe, curvature is interpreted as the dynamic interplay between matter and interacting fields; a view already emphasized by Einstein and Weyl, but sometimes overlooked in the literature. Building on these tools, a Newtonian framework is reconstructed that captures essential aspects of cosmology, showing how classical intuition can coexist with modern geometric insights. This perspective shifts the focus from substance to relationships, offering a fresh magnifying glass through which to reinterpret gravitational dynamics and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The similarities of this approach with other recent, more ambitious ones carried out at the quantum level are quite remarkable.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of a Minkowski-Minkowski wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the path-integral quantization of a minisuperspace cut-and-paste Lorentzian wormhole connecting two Minkowski spacetimes. The dynamics of the throat radius as a function of proper time is governed by a non-local effective action derived by an application of the Israel junction condition formalism. Within a saddle-point approximation of the propagator describing the evolution from an initial to a final throat radius, we show that topology-changing transitions are suppressed by the Jacobi determinant. In addition, we analyze the gravitational thermodynamics of the wormhole spacetime by a Wick rotation of the Israel-Lanczos equations in the presence of a thin-shell source. The resulting Euclideanized field equations are assumed to originate from a Euclidean effective gravity-matter action, which enters the path-integral representation of the gravitational canonical partition function. Therefrom we associate a temperature given by the inverse period of solutions, as well as a gravitational entropy as functions of the surface energy density and equation of state parameter of the shell. Both quantities are sourced entirely by the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across the junction. We show how this result can be applied to deduce a thermodynamic first law as the differential version of the conservation equation relating the effective mass of the shell to its surface pressure.</description>

      <title>The quasinormal mode content of binary black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully Bayesian, data-driven framework for identifying quasinormal modes in high-accuracy Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) gravitational waveforms. Applying this to a public catalog, we identify QNM overtones, retrograde modes, and nonlinear modes up to cubic order in the ringdown. The ringdown mode content is tabulated across a wide range of start times for all available simulations, providing a systematic reference for theoretical and observational studies. We also search for late-time power-law tails, which are, as expected, absent from the CCE waveforms.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Transition-to-plunge self-force waveforms with a spinning primary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ Simulations of Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second release of the $\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ waveform catalog, comprising four new quasi-circular, non-precessing, spinning binary black hole simulations. These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation detectors, including LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$) using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are publicly available via $\texttt{ScholarSphere}$.</description>

      <title>MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Boson Stars in $D \ge 4$ Dimensions: Stability, Oscillation Frequencies, and Dynamical Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric boson star solutions in $D \in \{4,5,6\}$ spacetime dimensions, considering the effects of both a quartic self-interaction term and a solitonic potential. We then perform a perturbative analysis, generalizing the pulsation equations to arbitrary dimension and potential and hence demonstrating the existence of radially stable higher-dimensional boson star solutions. We supplement these linear results with perturbed and unperturbed nonlinear dynamical evolutions in spherical symmetry, obtained using a dimensional reduction that allows us to evolve spacetimes with any number of background dimensions using the same numerical framework, while preserving the full gauge freedom of standard approaches to numerical relativity. The results of these evolutions indicate that the solutions we identify as perturbatively stable are indeed generally stable to nonlinear spherical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature: following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization. Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability as a description of the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime at the Big Bang as an Alternative to Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with $\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$, the set of solutions which agree with a $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.</description>

      <title>Glitch noise classification in KAGRA O3GK observing data using unsupervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the latest DESI data.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement of scalar bosons in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime: uniform magnetic field and rainbow gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and antibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform magnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive cosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an infinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers. Within the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric differential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy spectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials. Two representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and loop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric particle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized geometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \neq 0$ onto the $m = 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime. Increasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse, establishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local quantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that stronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into static or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that evolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how gravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale corrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic quantum fields in curved and magnetized backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Non-exotic traversable wormholes with strong deflection angle in King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos under f(R,Lm) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Inferring cosmological parameters from galaxy and dark sirens cross-correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of observed gravitational wave (GW) events is growing fast thanks to rapidly improving detector sensitivities. GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these "dark sirens" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.</description>

      <title>Is Gravity Truly Balanced? A Historical-Critical Journey Through the Equivalence Principle and the Genesis of Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel derivation of the spacetime metric generated by matter, without invoking Einstein's field equations. For static sources, the metric arises from a relativistic formulation of D'Alembert's principle, where the inertial force is treated as a real dynamical entity that exactly compensates gravity. This leads to a conformastatic metric whose geodesic equation, parametrized by proper time, reproduces the relativistic version of Newton's second law for free fall. To extend the description to moving matter, uniformly or otherwise, we apply a Lorentz transformation to the static metric. The resulting non static metric accounts for the motion of the sources and, remarkably, matches the weak field limit of general relativity as obtained from the linearized Einstein equations in the de Donder or Lorenz gauge. This approach, at least at Solar System scales, where gravitational fields are weak, is grounded in a new dynamical interpretation of the Equivalence Principle. It demonstrates how gravity can emerge from the relativistic structure of inertia, without postulating or solving Einstein's equations.</description>

      <title>Tests of restricted Quantum Focusing and a universal CFT bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT. We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d&gt;2$, we derive a new CFT constraint: the coincident limit of the product of two averaged null energy operators in any CFT cannot be zero. Equivalently, the rQFC imposes an upper bound of $2d-1$ on the scaling dimension of the leading even-spin Regge trajectory, analytically continued in $J$ and evaluated at $J=3$. The bound holds in free and weakly-interacting CFTs, and is saturated by the double-trace trajectories in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling. We speculate about a strengthened Quantum Null Energy Condition that would imply our results.</description>

      <title>De Sitter holographic complexity from Krylov complexity in DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the recent connection between the high energy limit of the double-scaled SYK model and two-dimensional de Sitter solutions of sine dilaton gravity to identify the length of a family of geodesics spanned between future and past infinities with Krylov spread complexity. This constitutes an explicit top-down microscopic realization of holographic complexity in a cosmological spacetime. Our identification is different from the existing holographic complexity proposals for de Sitter geometries which are anchored either on horizons as holographic screens or on timelike observers. This leads us to introduce and investigate a new cosmological holographic complexity proposal in any dimension. It is based on extremal timelike volumes anchored at the asymptotic past and future and at large values of the anchoring boundary coordinate grows linearly with growth rate proportional to the product of de Sitter entropy and temperature.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric hydrodynamics in numerical relativity: treating coordinate singularity, artificial heating and modeling MHD instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient, inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles, obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers: The influence of spin on the multi-messenger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Subhalos and Higher Order Catastrophes in Gravitational Wave Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We derive the scalar-tensor modification of the gravitational field of an ultrarelativistic particle beam and its effect on a test particle that is used as sensor. To do so, we solve the linearized scalar-tensor gravity field equations sourced by an energy-momentum tensor of a moving point particle. The geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation then predict the acceleration of the test particle as well as the momentum transfer due to a passing source. Comparing the momentum transfer predicted by general relativity and scalar tensor gravity, we find that there exists a relevant parameter regime where this difference increases significantly with the velocity of the source particle. Since ultrarelativistic particles are available at accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, ultraprecise acceleration sensors in the vicinity of the particle beam could potentially detect deviations from general relativity or constrain modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gases to an exponentially expanding universe - The Finsler-Friedmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Do Black Holes With Generalized Entropy Violate Bekenstein Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general yes, but also not quite. It is known that if the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by some kind of generalized entropy, then the Bekenstein bound may be grossly violated. In this work, we show that this undesired violation can be avoided if we employ the equivalence between generalized entropy and varying-$G$ gravity (GEVAG). In this approach, modifying entropy necessarily also modifies gravity (as one should expect if gravity is indeed inherently tied to thermodynamics), which leads to an effective gravitational "constant" $G_\text{eff}$ that is area-dependent, and a thermodynamic energy that is distinct from the ADM mass. We show that a relaxed Bekenstein bound of the form $S \leqslant CRE$ is always satisfied, albeit the coefficient $C$ is no longer $2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. This is a major advantage of the effective metric approach compared to previous GFT studies limited to volume perturbations. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that, in a very simple example, inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Considering that our results were obtained within a number of simplifying assumptions [...], we discuss how going beyond these assumptions could lead to a more desirable phenomenology. Overall, our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Observational Images of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen-type Dark Matter Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) surrounded by a Dehnen-(1, 4, 5/2) type dark matter (DM) halo, with a focus on how the DM halo's density $\rho_{s}$ and radius $r_{s}$ influence the BH's shadow and photon ring. First, the radius $r_h$ of the BH's event horizon and the equation of motion for photons were derived, and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for M87* were used to constrain the parameters $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ of the DM halo. Afterward, by varying the values of $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$, key parameters such as the effective potential $V_{eff}$ of photons, the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$, the radius $r_{isco}$ of the innermost stable circular orbit, and the radius $r_{ph}$ of the photon sphere were calculated for each case. It was found that as $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ increase, the above mentioned parameters all show an increasing trend. Subsequently, we investigated the optical appearance of the BH illuminated by two types of accretion models: optically and geometrically thin disk models and spherical accretion models. The findings indicate that as $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ increase, the peak of the received intensity shifts toward a higher impact parameter $b$, resulting in a distinct optical appearance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $n(\ge 4)$-dimensional planar black holes and wormholes with a flat exterior, which are originated by an exact solution in general relativity. The nonvacuum regions of these objects are described by the extended dynamical region inside a nondegenerate Killing horizon of Gamboa's static plane symmetric solution with a perfect fluid obeying a linear equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$. The matter field inside the horizon is not a perfect fluid but an anisotropic fluid that may be interpreted as a {\it spacelike} (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While it satisfies the null and strong energy conditions in the black hole case, it violates all the standard energy conditions in the wormhole case. The metric on the horizon is not analytic but at least $C^{1,1}$ in the single-null coordinates in both cases, so it is regular and there is no lightlike massive thin shell on the horizon.</description>

      <title>Dynamic shadow of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We research dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field $\psi$ evolves with time $t$, whose magnitude on apparent horizon $|\psi_{h}|$ starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation of the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$ is similar to that of the magnitude $|\psi_{h}|$. The emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the apparent horizon radius $r_{h}$ to start increasing sharply, and smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius $R_{sh}$ of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with $t_{o}$ the time at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius $R_{sh}$ is larger and also increases as $t_{o}$ increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points $t$. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the apparent horizon $r_{h}$, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the photon sphere $r_{ps}$, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. Since the variation of $r_{ps}$ is induced by $\psi$, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is likewise caused by the change of $\psi$. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the radius $R_{sh}$ of the shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay $\Delta t$ of lights propagating from light sources to observer. These findings not only enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modified first law of charged dilaton black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a charged dilaton black hole arising from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, where the dilaton couples exponentially to the Maxwell field via a dimensionless parameter a. Treating a as a continuous solution parameter, we extend the black hole first law to include a term Psi^A da, where Psi^A is the thermodynamic potential conjugate to a. We derive Psi^A explicitly through a differential analysis of the mass, charge, and entropy, and confirm its form via an independent Hamiltonian calculation. Additionally, by promoting a to a spacetime-dependent scalar and introducing auxiliary gauge fields, we provide a geometric interpretation of Psi^A as a conserved Noether charge. We further analyze the implications of treating a as a thermodynamic variable within the extended phase space. Despite the modification to the first law, we demonstrate that the Smarr relation remains unaffected due to the dimensionless nature of a, highlighting the distinction between variational and scaling symmetries. Our analysis supports the thermodynamic relevance of coupling constants and enriches the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Vector-Tensor Gravity and Its Spherically Symmetric Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamiltoinian analysis of the vector-tensor theory of gravity is performed. The resulting geometrical dynamics is reformulated into the connection dynamics, with the real SU(2)-connection serving as one of the configuration variables. This formulation allows us to extend the loop quantization scheme of general relativity to the vector-tensor theory, thereby rigorously constructing its quantum kinematical framework. The scalar constraint is promoted to a well-defined operator in the vertex Hilbert space, to represent quantum dynamics. Moreover, the spherically symmetric model of the vector-tensor theory is obtained by the symmetric reduction. Following the general deparametrization strategy for theories with diffeomorphism invariance, the spherically symmetric model can be fully deparametrized in terms of the degrees of freedom of the vector field. The corresponding reduced phase space quantization is carried out. The physical Hamiltonian generating relative evolution is promoted to a well-defined operator on the physical Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory of gravity provides a natural extension of general relativity by incorporating spacetime torsion to account for the intrinsic spin of matter. In this work, we investigate Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes supported by three distinct Yukawa-Casimir energy density profiles within the framework of EC gravity. The resulting shape functions are shown to satisfy all the fundamental requirements for traversable wormhole geometries. Our analysis reveals that the presence of exotic matter is unavoidable in sustaining these wormholes, and we quantify its total amount through the volume integral quantifier. Furthermore, the equilibrium of the wormhole configurations is established by examining the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. To enhance the physical relevance of the present work, we study several key features of the wormholes, including the embedding surface, proper radial distance, tidal forces, and total gravitational energy. In addition, we analyze the optical properties of wormholes by examining both the shadow and the strong deflection angle. All the findings collectively demonstrate the physical plausibility of Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes within the EC gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck, and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may be relevant in refining inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale.
  This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

Abstract: Tetrads are introduced in order to study the relationship between tetrad gauge states of spacetime and particle interactions, specially in weak processes at low energy. Through several examples like inverse Muon decay, elastic Neutrino-Electron scattering, it is explicitly shown how to assign to each vertex of the corresponding low-order Feynman diagram in a weak interaction, a particular set of tetrad vectors. The relationship between the tetrads associated to different vertices is exhibited explicitly to be generated by a SU(2) local tetrad gauge transformation. We are establishing a direct link between standard gauge and tetrad gauge states of spacetime using the quantum field theories perturbative formulations.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have enabled direct detections of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, their poor sky localisation and the typical lack of observable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts make it difficult to confidently identify their hosts, and study the environments that nurture their evolution. In this work, we show that $\textit{detailed}$ information of the host environment (e.g. the mass and steepness of the host potential) can be directly inferred by measuring the kinematic parameters (acceleration and its time-derivatives) of the binary's center of mass using GWs alone, without requiring an EM counterpart. We consider CBCs in various realistic environments such as globular clusters, nuclear star clusters, and active galactic nuclei disks to demonstrate how orbit and environment parameters can be extracted for CBCs detectable by ground- and space-based observatories, including the LIGO detector at A+ sensitivity, Einstein Telescope of the XG network, LISA, and DECIGO, $\textit{on a single-event basis}$. These constraints on host stellar environments promise to shed light on our understanding of how CBCs form, evolve, and merge.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Initial Data Sets with Vanishing Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Special Relativity, massless objects are characterized as either vacuum states or as radiation propagating at the speed of light. This distinction extends to General Relativity for asymptotically flat initial data sets (IDS) \((M^n, g, k)\), where vacuum is represented by slices of Minkowski space, and radiation is modeled by slices of \(pp\)-wave spacetimes. In contrast, we demonstrate that asymptotically hyperboloidal IDS with zero mass must embed isometrically into Minkowski space, with no possible IDS configurations modeling radiation in this setting. Our result holds under the most general assumptions. The proof relies on precise decay estimates for spinors on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. The largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed gravitational wave transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. We compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, which was previously reported in the literature. This deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of cluster-scale lenses through gravitational wave transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in the task of wide binary classification. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Hilbert spaces: invariant and co-invariant states, inner products, gauge-fixing, and BRST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hilbert spaces in theories of gravity are notoriously subtle due to the Hamiltonian constraints, particularly regarding the inner product. To demystify this subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity, and connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space interpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional (or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual ideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by requiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and explain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate that the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner product. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we explain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group averaging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the BRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and other physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and Gaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in the semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs (forming during radiation-dominated epoch) within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.</description>

      <title>Metric Convergence of Sequences of Static Spacetimes with the Null Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should one define metric space notions of convergence for sequences of spacetimes? Since a Lorentzian manifold does not define a metric space directly, the uniform convergence, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence, and Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat (SWIF) convergence does not extend automatically. One approach is to define a metric space structure, which is compatible with the Lorentzian structure, so that the usual notions of convergence apply. This approach was taken by C. Sormani and C. Vega when defining the null distance. In this paper, we study sequences of static spacetimes equipped with the null distance under uniform, GH, and SWIF convergence, as well as H\"{o}lder bounds. We use the results of the Volume Above Distance Below (VADB) theorem of the author, R. Perales, and C. Sormani to prove an analog of the VADB theorem for sequences of static spacetimes with the null distance. We also give a conjecture of what the VADB theorem should be in the case of sequences of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with the null distance.</description>

      <title>On the Imaginary Part of the Effective Action in de Sitter Spacetime with Different Regularization Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>
