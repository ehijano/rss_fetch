      <title>Enhancing DUNE's solar neutrino capabilities with neutral-current detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) has the potential to make a precise measurement of the total active flux of 8B solar neutrinos via neutral-current (NC) interactions with argon. This would complement proposed precise measurements of solar-neutrino fluxes in DUNE via charged-current (CC) interactions with argon and mixed CC/NC interactions with electrons. Together, these would enable DUNE to make a SNO-like comparison of rates and thus to make the most precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ using solar neutrinos. Realizing this potential requires dedicated but realistic efforts to improve DUNE's low-energy capabilities and separately to reduce neutrino-argon cross section uncertainties. Comparison of mixing-parameter results obtained using solar neutrinos in DUNE and reactor antineutrinos in JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) would allow unprecedented tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>p--$\phi$ femtoscopic correlation analysis using a dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the p--$\phi$ correlation functions in high-multiplicity proton+proton collisions at the LHC using a dynamical model, DCCI2, and discuss the effects of collision dynamics on the p--$\phi$ femtoscopic study. Collision dynamics, such as collective expansion and hadronic rescatterings, leads to the relative momentum-dependent non-Gaussian source functions. This results in deviations in the correlation functions compared to those using the Gaussian source function adopted in existing studies. Our analysis shows the importance of using the source functions that reflect more realistic collision dynamics for future precision analysis of hadron interactions via femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>$^{229}\mathrm{ThF}_4$ thin films for solid-state nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After nearly fifty years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited [1,2] and measured with high spectroscopic precision [3]. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust [4,5] than and may outperform [6,7] current optical atomic clocks. They also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model [5,8,9]. In light of these important advances and applications, a dramatic increase in the need for $^{229}$Th spectroscopy targets in a variety of platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration $^{229}$Th-doped crystals [5] used in previous measurements [1-3,10] are challenging due to the scarcity and radioactivity of the $^{229}$Th material. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by demonstrating laser excitation of the nuclear transition in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films grown with a physical vapor deposition process, consuming only micrograms of $^{229}$Th material. The $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical \thor-doped crystals [1-3,10]. The high nuclear emitter density in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we describe the operation and present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF$_4$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of unpolarized quark Transverse Momentum Distributions from a global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extraction of the unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions that takes into account possible differences between quark flavors and final-state hadrons. The extraction is based on experimental measurements from Drell-Yan processes and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, whose combination is essential to distinguish flavor differences. The analysis is carried out at N$^3$LL accuracy. The extracted flavor-dependent distributions give a very good description of the data ($\chi^2/N_{\rm dat} = 1.08$). The resulting uncertainties take fully into account also the uncertainties in the determination of the corresponding collinear distributions.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators -- arXiv note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note serves as a companion to a Letter, where we introduce a new energy correlator-based observable designed to minimize the impact of selection bias due to energy loss in inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Here, we apply the method outlined in the Letter to the first-ever measurement of energy correlators in heavy-ion collisions, recently released by the CMS Collaboration.</description>
