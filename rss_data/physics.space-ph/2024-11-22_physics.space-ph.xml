      <title>Evidence of potential thermospheric overcooling during the May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During intense geomagnetic storms, the rapid and significant production of NO followed by its associated infrared radiative emission in lower thermosphere contributes crucially to the energetics of the upper atmosphere. This makes NO infrared radiative cooling a very important phenomenon which needs to be considered for accurate density forecasting in thermosphere. This study reports the investigation of variations in thermospheric density, and NO radiative cooling during the recent geomagnetic superstorm of May 2024. A very rare post-storm thermospheric density depletion of about -23% on May 12 was observed by Swarm-C in northern hemisphere in comparison to the prestorm condition on May 9. This overcooling was observed despite the continuous enhancement in solar EUV (24-36 nm) flux throughout the event. The thermospheric NO infrared radiative emission in the recovery phase of the storm seems to be the plausible cause for this observed post-storm density depletion. The TIMED/SABER observed thermospheric density between 105 and 110 km altitude shows an enhancement during this thermospheric overcooling. Our analysis also suggests an all time high thermospheric NO radiative cooling flux up to 11.84 ergs/cm2/sec during May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm, which has also been compared with famous Halloween storms of October 2003.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>
