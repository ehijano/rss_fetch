      <title>On Sesquilinear Forms for Lower Semibounded (Singular) Sturm-Liouville Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any self-adjoint extension of a (singular) Sturm-Liouville operator bounded from below uniquely leads to an associated sesquilinear form. This form is characterized in terms of principal and nonprincipal solutions of the Sturm-Liouville operator by using generalized boundary values. We provide these forms in detail in all possible cases (explicitly, when both endpoints are limit circle, when one endpoint is limit circle, and when both endpoints are limit point).</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of anisotropic geodesics in the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a lower semicontinuous, 1-homogeneous positive function defined on $\mathbf{R}^n$. We provide a characterization of absolutely continuous paths that minimize the anisotropic $F$-length between two points. The characterization is achieved by establishing a connection between the minimizing paths and the geometry of the anisotropic $F$-isoperimetric set.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Ces\'aro General Fourier Sums of Functions with Derivatives of Lipschitz Class Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Ces\'aro means of Fourier series with respect to general orthonormal systems (ONS), when the function \( f \) belongs to a certain differentiable class of functions. 
  It is well known that the membership of a function \( f \not\equiv 0 \) in a differentiable class does not, in general, guarantee the summability of its Fourier series with respect to an arbitrary ONS.
  Therefore, in order for the Fourier series with respect to a given ONS to be summable, one must impose additional conditions on the system functions \( \{\varphi_n\} \). 
  The main objective of this work is to determine such conditions on the functions \( \varphi_n \) of the ONS under which the Ces\'aro means of the Fourier series of any function whose derivative belongs to the Lipschitz class \( \mathrm{Lip}_1 \) are uniformly bounded. 
  The results obtained are sharp in the sense that the conditions cannot be essentially weakened.</description>

      <title>Families of self-inverse functions and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a self-inverse function via an integral equivalent to a two-term combination of dilogarithms. We refer to this function as a fundamental form, since there is a family of extensions of this function that satisfy similar self-inverse and symmetric properties. We also construct a family of functions generalizing the fundamental form via two auxiliary parameters, which we refer to as shape and scale factors. Through new integration techniques, we introduce and prove a number of dilogarithm identities and dilogarithm ladders, and we provide new proofs for all the known analytic real values for the dilogarithm function, apart from the unity argument case. Corresponding results can also be derived in the complex domain. The functions $\gemini_{a}^{b}(x)$ we introduce are referred to as gemini functions and may be seen as providing a broad framework in the derivation of and application of dilogarithm identities.</description>

Abstract: In this expository article, we briefly survey the main known schemes of proof of sparse domination principles within harmonic analysis. We then use the one based on the Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition to prove a dual sparse domination estimate for Calder\'on-Zymgund operators with Dini-smooth kernels, with an eye on the difficulties that arise when trying to transfer the argument to spaces with nondoubling measures.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism theorem for sums of translates on the real axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study sums of translates on the real axis. These functions generalize logarithms of weighted algebraic polynomials. Namely, we are dealing with the following functions \[ F(\mathbf{y},t) := J(t) + \sum \limits_{j=1}^n K_j(t-y_j), \quad \mathbf{y} := (y_1,\ldots,y_n), \ y_1 \le \ldots \le y_n, \] where the field function $J$ is a function defined on $\mathbb{R}$, which is "admissible" for the kernels $K_1,\ldots,K_n$ concave on $(-\infty,0)$ and on $(0,\infty)$ and having a singularity at $0.$ We consider "local maxima" \begin{gather*} \begin{aligned} m_0(\mathbf{y}) &amp; := \sup \limits_{t \in (-\infty, y_1]} F(\mathbf{y}, t), \quad m_n(\mathbf{y}) := \sup \limits_{t \in [y_n, \infty)} F(\mathbf{y}, t),\\ m_j(\mathbf{y}) &amp; := \sup \limits_{t \in [y_j, y_{j+1}]} F(\mathbf{y}, t), \quad j = 1,\ldots,n-1, \end{aligned} \end{gather*} and the difference function \[ D(\mathbf{y}) := (m_1(\mathbf{y})-m_0(\mathbf{y}), m_2(\mathbf{y})-m_1(\mathbf{y}),\ldots,m_n(\mathbf{y})-m_{n-1}(\mathbf{y})). \] We prove that, under certain assumptions on monotonicity of the kernels, $D$ is a homeomorphism between its domain and $\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <title>A Baseline $T\log^2 T$ Upper Bound for KL-Regularized Prime--Zero Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathsf{OT}_\eta(T)\ll T\log^2 T$ unconditionally via a band-limited test scheme with Fej\'er averaging. The approach normalizes $\|\widehat f\|_1=\Theta(T^{-1})$ to ensure $\|h\|_1\asymp T$ and $\|\widehat h\|_1\ll 1$, and applies an $L^1$-controlled smoothed explicit formula to bound the error terms. As a result, the prime--zero optimal transport distance admits the baseline $T\log^2 T$ upper bound without additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>

      <title>Variable Matrix-Weighted Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, applying matrix ${\mathcal A}_{p(\cdot),\infty}$ weights introduced in our previous work, we introduce the matrix-weighted variable Besov space via the matrix weight $W$ or the reducing operators ${\mathbb{A}}$ of order $p(\cdot)$ for $W$, Then we show that, defined either by the matrix weight $W$ or the reducing operators ${\mathbb{A}}$ of order $p(\cdot)$ for $W$, the matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces (respectively, the matrix-weighted variable Besov sequence spaces) are both equal. Next, we establish the $\varphi$-transform theorem for matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces and, using this, find that the definition of matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces is independent of the choice of $\varphi$. After that, for the further discussion of variable Besov spaces, we establish the theorem of almost diagonal operators and then, by using this, we establish the molecular characterization. Then, with applying the molecular characterization, we obtain the wavelet and atomic characterizations of matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces. Finally, as an application, we consider some classical operators. By using the wavelet characterization, we establish the trace operator and obtain the theorem of trace operators. Moreover, with applying the molecular characterization, we establish the theorem of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>On exponential separation of analytic self-conformal sets on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, Rapaport showed that the there is no dimension drop for exponentially separated analytic IFSs on the real line. We show that the set of such exponentially separated IFSs in the space of analytic IFSs contains an open and dense set in the $\mathcal{C}^2$ topology. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the IFS to be exponentially separated which allows us to construct explicit examples which are exponentially separated. The key technical tool is the introduction of the \textit{dual IFS} which we believe has significant interest in its own right. As an application we also characterise when an analytic IFS can be conjugated to a self-similar IFS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sums of translates generalize logarithms of weighted algebraic polynomials. The paper presents the solution to the minimax and maximin problems on the real axis for sums of translates. We prove that there is a unique function that is extremal in both problems. The key in our proof is a reduction to the problem on a segment. For this, we work out an analogue of the Mhaskar-Rakhmanov-Saff theorem, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is no unconditional basis of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$, for any set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of finite measure. This is a consequence of a more general result due to Gaposhkin, who proved that the space $L^p(\Omega)$ does not admit a seminormalized unconditional basis consisting of uniformly bounded functions. We show that the latter result fails if the word "basis" is replaced with "Schauder frame". On the other hand we prove that if $\Omega$ has nonempty interior then there are no unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$.</description>

      <title>Frostman random variables, entropy inequalities, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent regimes. We prove that for any non-degenerate rational quadratic form $\phi(x, y)$ and parameter $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, there exists a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)$ such that \[ \max\{H_n(X+Y), H_n(\phi(X,Y))\} \geq n(s+\epsilon) \] for sufficiently large $n$, where the precise conditions on $(X,Y)$ depend on the Frostman level. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, and a dense subset $G\subset A\times A$, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\phi_G(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$, $\{A+_GA:=\{x+y\colon (x, y)\in G\}$, and $\phi_G(A):=\{\phi(x, y)\colon (x, y)\in G\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that \[|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.\] This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0&lt;x\le y&lt;2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)&gt;0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</description>

      <title>Radon-type transforms for holomorphic and Hermitian monogenic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard Radon transform of holomorphic functions is not always well defined, as the integration of such functions over planes may not converge. In this paper, we introduce new Radon-type transforms of co-(real)dimension $2$ for harmonic and holomorphic functions on the unit ball. These transforms are abstractly defined as orthogonal projections onto spaces of complex harmonic and holomorphic plane waves, respectively. The inversion formulas are derived based on the dual transform, while the latter is defined as an integration on a complex Stiefel manifold. Our transforms are extended to the Fock space and give rise to a new transform defined on the entire $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ through the Segal-Bargmann transform. Furthermore, we develop these transforms for Hermitian monogenic functions on the unit ball, thereby refining the Szeg\"o-Radon transform for monogenic functions introduced by Colombo, Sabadini and Sommen.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the space SBV$_X$ of special functions with bounded $X$-variation in Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces and study its main properties. Our main outcome is an approximation result, with respect to the BV$_X$ topology, for SBV$_X$ functions.</description>

      <title>Roots of real-valued zero mean maps: Compositions of linear functionals and equivariant maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel topological framework that yields results constraining the distribution of zeros of certain zero mean real-valued maps, namely those obtained from composing a fixed equivariant map with linear functionals. We use this framework to establish upper bounds for the topology of set systems in the domain where (multivariate) trigonometric polynomials do not change their sign, generalizing and, in certain regimes, strengthening results in the literature. Our results more generally contain restrictions on the distribution of zeros of Chebyshev spaces as special cases. Lastly, we apply this framework to derive existence results for efficient cubature rules for compositions of affine functionals and equivariant maps.</description>

      <title>On the properties of alternating invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functions satisfying the functional equation \begin{align*} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$}, \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</description>
