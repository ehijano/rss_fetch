      <title>Quantum nuclear dynamics on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear dynamics with wavepacket time-evolution is classically intractable and viewed as a promising avenue for quantum information processing. Here, we use an IonQ 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, Harmony, to study the quantum wavepacket dynamics of a shared-proton within a short-strong hydrogen-bonded system. We also provide the first application of distributed quantum computing for chemical dynamics problems, where the distributed set of quantum processes is constructed using a tensor network formalism. For a range of initial states, we experimentally drive the ion-trap system to emulate the quantum nuclear wavepacket as it evolves along the potential surface generated from electronic structure. Following the experimental creation of the nuclear wavepacket, we extract measurement observables such as its time-dependent spatial projection and its characteristic vibrational frequencies to good agreement with classical results. Vibrational eigenenergies obtained from quantum computational are in agreement with those obtained from classical simulations to within a fraction of a kcal/mol, thus suggesting chemical accuracy. Our approach opens a new paradigm for studying the quantum chemical dynamics and vibrational spectra of molecules and also provides the first demonstration for parallel quantum computation on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement with neutral atoms in the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum information processing with capabilities beyond that of classical computation. We study the generation and role of entanglement in the dynamics of spin-1/2 models, both for the design of quantum gates for general-purpose quantum computation and for quantum simulation of interacting spin models. We introduce the neutral atom M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, involving rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing interleaved in a spin-echo sequence. We show its robustness to quasi-static experimental imperfections and favorable scaling with the time-energy scales of Rydberg-mediated entanglement generation. In quantum simulation, we consider critical behavior in quench dynamics of transverse field Ising models. Using matrix product states to calculate the dynamics, we find that order parameters, critical point, and critical exponents can be estimated using modest bond dimensions. Considering the role of chaos and equilibration in quenches, we find that local observables are well approximated either due to low global entanglement or the proximity of local marginals to the maximally mixed state. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying relevant quantum phenomena that remain inaccessible to classical descriptions. Understanding the regimes where classical descriptions fail but remain accessible to pre-fault tolerant quantum hardware will help inform the design of future quantum information processors</description>

      <title>A clock with $8\times10^{-19}$ systematic uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an optical lattice clock with a total systematic uncertainty of $8.1 \times 10^{-19}$ in fractional frequency units, representing the lowest uncertainty of any clock to date. The clock relies on interrogating the ultra-narrow ${}^1S_0 \rightarrow {}^3P_0$ transition in a dilute ensemble of fermionic strontium atoms trapped in a vertically-oriented, shallow, one-dimensional optical lattice. Using imaging spectroscopy, we previously demonstrated record high atomic coherence time and measurement precision enabled by precise control of collisional shifts and the lattice light shift. In this work, we revise the black body radiation shift correction by evaluating the $5s4d$ $^3D_1$ lifetime, necessitating precise characterization and control of many body effects in the $5s4d$ $^3D_1$ decay. Lastly, we measure the second order Zeeman coefficient on the least magnetically sensitive clock transition. All other systematic effects have uncertainties below $1 \times 10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>Migdal-type effect in the dark matter absorption process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of absorption of dark matter particles in atoms which resembles the Migdal effect of inelastic dark matter scattering. In this process, atom may be ionized upon absorption of a scalar particle through the scalar-nucleon Yukawa-type interaction. The crucial difference from the inelastic dark matter scattering on atoms is that the total energy of the particle, including its rest mass $mc^2$-term, is transferred to the electron. As a result, the emitted electron kinetic energy is about six orders in magnitude bigger than that in the dark matter scattering process. This absorption process allows one to probe dark matter particles with a relatively small mass, in the range from 1 to 100 keV, that cannot be detected in the scattering process. It is also possible to detect hypothetical scalar particles emitted from the Sun. We calculate absorption cross sections of this process in Na, Si, Ar, Ge, I, Xe, and Tl target atoms and extract limits on the scalar-nucleon interaction constant from null results of XENONnT experiment.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of the atomic mass of $^{84}$Sr and implications to isotope shift studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absolute mass of $^{84}$Sr was determined using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. A more precise value for the mass of $^{84}$Sr is essential for providing potential indications of physics beyond the Standard Model through high-precision isotope shift measurements of Sr atomic transition frequencies. The mass excess of $^{84}$Sr was refined to be -80649.229(37) keV/c$^2$ from high-precision cyclotron-frequency-ratio measurements with a relative precision of 4.8$\times$10$^{-10}$. The obtained mass-excess value is in agreement with the adopted value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020, but is 30 times more precise. With this new value, we confirm the previously observed nonlinearity in the study of the isotope shift of strontium. Moreover, the double-beta ($2\beta^{+}$) decay $Q$ value of $^{84}$Sr was directly determined to be 1790.115(37) keV, and the precision was improved by a factor of 30.</description>
