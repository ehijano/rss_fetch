      <title>Multiplet Supercurrents in a Josephson Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to host synthetic topological phases of matter and Floquet states. However, the energy scales governing topological protection in these devices are on the order of the spacing between Andreev bound states. Recent theories suggest that similar phenomena may instead be explored in circuits composed of two-terminal Josephson junctions, allowing for the topological protection to be controlled by the comparatively large Josephson energy. Here, we explore a Josephson circuit, in which three superconducting electrodes are connected through Josephson junctions to a common superconducting island. We demonstrate the dynamic generation of multiplet resonances, which have previously been observed in multiterminal Josephson junctions. The multiplets are found to be robust to elevated temperatures and are confirmed by exhibiting the expected Shapiro step quantization under a microwave drive. We also find an unexpected novel supercurrent, which couples a pair of contacts that are both voltage-biased with respect to the common superconducting island. We show that this supercurrent results from synchronization of the phase dynamics and pose the question whether it should also carry a topological contribution.</description>

      <title>Phase-Separated Charge Order and Twinning Across Length Scales in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-ray scattering studies resolving structural twinning and phase separation in the charge density wave (CDW) state of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The three-dimensional CDW state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is reported to form a complex superposition of Star of David (SoD) or Tri-Hexagonal (TrH) patterns of distortion within its kagome planes, but the out-of-plane stacking is marked by metastability. In order to resolve the impact of this metastability, we present reciprocal space mapping and real-space images of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ collected across multiple length scales using temperature-dependent high-dynamic range mapping (HDRM) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). The experimental data provide evidence for a rich microstructure that forms in the CDW state. Data evidence metastability in the formation of $2\times 2\times 4$ and $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW supercells dependent on thermal history and mechanical deformation. We further directly resolve the real space phase segregation of both supercells as well as a real-space, structural twinning driven by the broken rotational symmetry of the CDW state. Our combined results provide insights into the role of microstructure and twinning in experiments probing the electronic properties of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ where rotational symmetry is broken by the three-dimensional charge density wave order but locally preserved for any single kagome layer.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a Fibonacci quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodicity has recently been proposed to enhance superconductivity and its proximity effect. At the same time, there has been significant experimental progress in the fabrication of quasiperiodic structures, also in reduced dimensions. Motivated by these developments, we use microscopic tight-binding theory to investigate the DC Josephson effect through a ballistic Fibonacci chain attached to two superconducting leads. The Fibonacci chain is one of the most studied examples of quasicrystals, hosting a rich multifractal spectrum, containing topological gaps with different winding numbers. We study how the Andreev bound states (ABS), current-phase relation, and the critical current depend on the quasiperiodic degrees of freedom, from short to long junctions. While the current-phase relation shows a traditional $2\pi$ sinusoidal or sawtooth profile, we find that the ABS obtain quasiperiodic oscillations and that the Andreev reflection is qualitatively altered, leading to quasiperiodic oscillations in the critical current as a function of junction length. Surprisingly, despite earlier proposals of quasiperiodicity enhancing superconductivity compared to crystalline junctions, we do not in general find that it enhances the critical current. However, we find significant current enhancement for reduced interface transparency due to the modified Andreev reflection. Furthermore, by varying the chemical potential, e.g. by an applied gate voltage, we find a fractal oscillation between superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) and superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) behavior. Finally, we show that the winding of the subgap states leads to an equivalent winding in the critical current, such that the winding numbers, and thus the topological invariant, can be determined.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>
