      <title>Predictive Accuracy versus Interpretability in Energy Markets: A Copula-Enhanced TVP-SVAR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether structural econometric models can rival machine learning in forecasting energy--macro dynamics while retaining causal interpretability. Using monthly data from 1999 to 2025, we develop a unified framework that integrates Time-Varying Parameter Structural VARs (TVP-SVAR) with advanced dependence structures, including DCC-GARCH, t-copulas, and mixed Clayton--Frank--Gumbel copulas. These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics. This synthesis offers a pathway where AI accuracy and economic interpretability jointly inform energy policy and risk management.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Trade Execution with Market and Limit Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework for optimal trade execution in a limit order book. We formulate the trade execution problem as a dynamic allocation task whose objective is the optimal placement of market and limit orders to maximize expected revenue. By modeling market and limit order allocations with multivariate logistic-normal distributions, the framework enables efficient training of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional benchmark strategies in simulated limit order book environments featuring noise traders submitting random orders, tactical traders responding to order book imbalances, and a strategic trader seeking to acquire or liquidate an asset position.</description>
