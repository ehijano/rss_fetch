      <title>The sound of quintessence: analogue Kiselev acoustic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the geometry of a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by a Kiselev anisotropic fluid can be effectively mimicked by an experimental setup as the ones used to investigate some physical phenomena associated with acoustic black holes. Thus, we construct the metric describing Kiselev acoustic black holes by using the Gross--Pitaevskii theory and present a general analytical solution that encompasses, as particular cases, several classes of geometries associated with black holes. This unified framework allows for the description of a wide variety of analogue spacetimes, including new analogue geometries that have not been previously explored in the literature. Then, we examine the behavior of scalar field perturbations in this background by solving the massless Klein--Gordon equation. Depending on the boundary conditions between the acoustic event horizon and infinity, we obtain the quasinormal and quasibound spectra. This study opens up avenues for experimental investigation within the context of analog gravity models, by offering new possibilities to simulate and study black hole phenomena in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Distinct Functions $f$ of the Non-metricity Scalar $Q$ : A Dynamical System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel gravity is one among the general relativistic trinity which deals with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. In the Einstein Hilbert action, a function of $Q$ is chosen to be the main contributory part of the Lagrangian and a modified theory of gravity is constructed. In literature, different structures of the function of $Q$ are found which sustain several astrophysical observations like Big Bang nucleosynthesis, late-time cosmic acceleration etc. Autonomous systems for each such models with different $f(Q)$ structures are constructed. Corresponding fixed points and their stability properties are studied. For every case, stable, unstable and saddle-type fixed points are found to exist. These points on the phase portraits are cosmologically analyzed. It is tried to justify which way the corresponding state may lead if the initial state is perturbed. A comparative study of different models is represented.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quasinormal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift modes. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Four $f(Q)$ Gravity Models : A Cosmological Review in the Background of Bianchi-I Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the non-metricity scalar $Q$ as the functional argument, several $f(Q)$ gravity models is found to be proposed which are perfectly able to mimic the late time accelerated expansion as pointed out by the type Ia supernovae observations. Temperature fluctuation differences for two celestial hemispheres, Hubble tension, voids, dipole modulation, anisotropic inflation etc motivates us to think beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model and cosmological principle. Bianchi-I model portrays anisotropic universe imposing shear. $f(Q)$ model also enables us to produce early inflation to late deSitter universe without the requirement of $\Lambda$CDM. Embarrassment regarding fine tuning or coincidences can be avoided alongwith. So, this article finds different stationary points of cosmic evolution with $f(Q)$ models habilitating in Bianchi-I anisotropic universe. Depending on models' nature, fixed points with different categories are found. Perturbations are followed wherever are applicable. While pursuing cosmological implications towards these fixed points, some are found to be formed only for the consideration of $f(Q)$ gravity and Bianchi-I both. Besides different prediction towards early inflation to late time expansion which are available in existing literature of dynamical system studies, occurances of ultra slow roll inflation is predicted. For particular $f(Q)$ model, shear is predicted to decay leaving behind a constant valued residue. This models a universe that gradually turns more homogeneous. In some other models, depending on initial conditions, a final isotropic leftover is marked as the future fate of anisotropic world. More than one stable points are marked for special cases and are cosmologically interpreted.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Complex Gravity as a Geometric Resolution of the Black Hole Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the black hole information paradox in the setting of pseudo-complex gravity, a covariant geometric extension of general relativity that introduces a minimal length scale by deforming the spacetime manifold. In this framework, curvature invariants stay finite, and the classical singularity is geometrically regularized via a smooth core. We show that the correction term B/(6r**4) alters the Schwarzschild metric, generating the regularized geometry above, yielding a finite Hawking temperature, and inducing subleading corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Crucially, we demonstrate that the pseudo-complex geometric structure obstructs a clean factorization of the Hilbert space into interior and exterior regions, thereby removing the key assumption behind the standard derivation of the paradox. This structural reinterpretation of entanglement flow offers a new geometric route to unitarity preservation and information recovery. We examine the resulting effects on evaporation dynamics, entropy flow, and thermodynamic behavior. Our predictions are compared with those of generalized uncertainty principles (GUP), loop quantum gravity (LQG), and island-based models, and are summarized in a comparative table. Observable signatures-such as shifts in quasi-normal mode frequencies and the appearance of gravitational wave echoes from the regularized core-suggest that pseudo-complex gravity is a testable, covariant approach to resolving the paradox without invoking firewalls, holography, or exotic quantum states.</description>

      <title>High-frequency backreaction for the Einstein equations under $\mathbb U(1)$ symmetry: from Einstein-dust to Einstein-Vlasov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given suitable small, localized, $\mathbb U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in an elliptic gauge, we prove that they can be approximated by high-frequency vacuum spacetimes. This extends previous constructions where the limiting spacetime solves the Einstein-(multiple) null dust system (i.e., where the limiting massless Vlasov field can be written as a finite sum of delta measures). The proof proceeds by first approximating solutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system by solutions to the Einstein-(multiple) null dust system, then approximating solutions to the Einstein-null dust system by vacuum solutions. In the process, we take the number of families of dusts to infinity.</description>

      <title>Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum orbital period in the background of 5-dimensional charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the upper and lower bounds on the minimum orbital period of 5-dimensional charged black holes. Our results indicate that the upper bound of the minimum orbital period corresponds to non-charged black holes, while the lower bound is achieved in the case of maximally charged black holes. We further establish precise analytical expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the minimum orbital period. Our findings provide valuable insights into 5-dimensional charged black holes and help constrain theoretical gravity models.</description>

      <title>Black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter with a background Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an intent to explore the interplay between the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) and the presence of dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution in the background of nonminimally coupled Kalb-Ramond (KR) field surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). The KR field is frozen to a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) that breaks the particle Lorentz symmetry spontaneously. We explore scalar invariants, Ricci Scalar, Ricci squared, and Kretschmann Scalar, to probe the nature of singularities in the obtained solution. We then study strong gravitational lensing in the background of our BH, i.e., KRPFDM BH, revealing the adverse impact of LSB parameter $\alpha$ and PFDM parameter $\beta$ on the lensing coefficients. The significant effect of our model parameters is evident in strong lensing observables. Bounds on the deviation from Schwarzschild, $\delta$, for supermassive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ from the EHT, Keck, and VLTI observatories are then utilized to put our BH model to the test and extract possible values of model parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that generate theoretical predictions in line with experimental observations within $1\sigma$ confidence level. Our study sheds light on the combined effect of LSB and PFDM and may be helpful in finding their signature.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the Deviation of Kerr Metric via Bumpy Parameterization and Particle Swarm Optimization in Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy" spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.</description>

      <title>Analogy of space-time as an elastic medium -- Study of the perturbation tensor of the metric $h_{\mu\nu}$ through the prism of the analogy of the theory of elasticity -- Analysis and potential consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state of the art of the different deformations of space-time measured for more than a hundred years in the case of general relativity in the weak field is carried out. The phenomena of general relativity in low fields targeted are gravitational waves, Lense-thirring effects, gravitational lensing, gravitation around the earth or the sun. The overview of these different deformations highlights the different active components of the perturbation tensor of the metric $h_{\mu\nu}$. The authors show that each phenomenon corresponds to one or more very specific components of this tensor. They also show that the various components of the latter have as an image, within the framework of the elastic analogy of space-time, various coherent components of an associated strain tensor epsilon munu in terms of elongation, shortening or angular distortion of an equivalent elastic medium, modeling the behavior of space-time. By this synthetic ensemble approach and this elastic analogy, it appears clearly for the first time that some components of this tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$ remain to be determined and measured in adequacy with potential new phenomena or modified versions of general relativity in a weak field.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Coincident GR in Internal STEGR Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Coincident General Relativity (CGR) in the gauge approach to gravity based on Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the {\it internal-space formulation}, which one of the authors recently proposed in Ref.~[J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025) 5, 052505]. First, we review the standard formulation of STEGR theories in the Palatini approach to gravity, in which formulation we impose the teleparallel and torsion-free conditions by using Lagrange multipliers. Second, we introduce the STEGR theories in the gauge approach to gravity, which is formulated in the internal space, and derive its field equations. We briefly discuss whether the Ostrogradski ghost instability exists and find that the theory may require a degenerate condition to be imposed. Finally, assuming the coincident gauge, we derive CGR in both terms of the action integral and the field equation. Discussing the possible kinematics of the STEGR theory, we formulate a motion of a test scalar particle in the spacetime with non-metricity.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate Dark Matter in the Core of Neutron Stars: Implications for Gravitational-wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We thoroughly investigate the scenario where dark matter is admixed with the ordinary nuclear matter in a neutron star, focusing on the finite temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as the dark matter candidate. These hybrid configurations yield masses and radii that match observed values of pulsar mass-radius observation and adhere to dimensionless tidal Love number constraints from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. By analyzing possible, stable mass-radius configurations and the dimensionless tidal Love number constraints, we determine the dark matter content in a nuclear matter whose masses and radii comply with these astrophysical limits. We perform our analyses with three models for the ordinary nuclear matter equation of state (EoS), APR4, MPA1, and SLy. Our analyses suggest that if APR4 is the correct nuclear matter EoS governing neutron stars in the Universe, and the components of this event were indeed dark matter admixed neutron stars, then the most likely dark matter fractions in their cores are approximately 5.65% and 7.97%, respectively. In contrast, for the other two EoSs considered, the predicted dark matter fractions are significantly higher, exceeding 12%. We also consider finite temperature BEC stars. We find that temperature has negligible effect on the stability criteria or tidal properties of these dark matter admixed neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Binary black holes in the heat of merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole binary approaching merger undergoes changes in its inspiral rate as energy and angular momentum are lost from the orbits into the horizons. This effect strengthens as the black holes come closer. We use numerical relativity data to model this so-called tidal heating in the strong gravity regime. We present a frequency-domain approximant for nonspinning black hole binaries that accounts for tidal heating effects up to the merger frequency. The approximant includes horizon parameters that characterize the nature of the compact objects. By applying this model to a binary black hole baseline that incorporates tidal heating, one can construct a more accurate point-particle waveform, one that is devoid of finite-size effects of the component objects. We also discuss its ramifications in modeling binary neutron star systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical gravity theory predicts a state-dependent gravitational potential for a quantum test mass, leading to nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton (SN) state evolution that contrasts with quantum gravity. Testing the effect of SN evolution can provide evidence for distinguishing quantum gravity and classical gravity, which is challenging to realize in the stationary optomechanical systems as analyzed in previous works [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024004 (2023), Phys. Rev. D 111, 062004 (2025)]. This work is devoted to analyzing the possibility of capturing the signature of SN theory during the non-stationary evolution of the test mass under the optomechanical measurement, where the second-order moments of a test mass can exhibit a distinctive oscillatory behavior. We show that this feature manifest in the non-stationary noise spectrum of outgoing light as additional peaks structures, although resolving these structures in practical experiments requires a larger number of repetitive trials with our sampling parameters, which is cost-prohibitive. To address this issue, we further employ statistical inference methods to extract more comprehensive information, thereby reducing the required number of experimental repetitions. Through Mock-Data simulations, we demonstrate that only 10 experimental trials of 40 seconds each are sufficient to reduce the false alarm rate for distinguishing between the two models to below one percent.</description>

      <title>Testing the quantum nature of gravity through interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.</description>

      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry I: Catalogue of totally symmetric rank-three field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically obtain all linear models which propagate a totally symmetric rank-three field without parity violation on a flat background. Each such model is defined exclusively by its gauge symmetry, a necessary property of effective field theories in the infrared limit. By comparison, models obtained by other means (tuning couplings or cherry-picking operators) may be unstable against radiative corrections. For each model, we compute the spectrum of massless and massive particles, and the no-ghost-no-tachyon constraints on the couplings. We conclude that foundational models exist which can propagate one massless particle of spin one or spin three in isolation, or both particles simultaneously, generalising the model of Campoleoni and Francia. Our algorithm for detecting symmetric models is grounded in particle physics methods, being based directly on the Wigner decomposition of the field. Compared to our recent analysis of the totally symmetric rank-three field (whose results we confirm and extend) our new algorithm does not require an ansatz for the symmetry transformation, and is not restricted to so-called 'free' symmetries.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field-driven anisotropies on the equation of state probed in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers can produce extreme magnetic fields, some of which can lead to strong magnetar-like remnants. While strong magnetic fields have been shown to affect the dynamics of outflows and angular momentum transport in the remnant, they can also crucially alter the properties of nuclear matter probed in the merger. In this work, we provide a first assessment of the latter, determining the strength of the pressure anisotropy caused by Landau level quantization and the anomalous magnetic moment. To this end, we perform the first numerical relativity simulation with a magnetic polarization tensor and a magnetic-field-dependent equation of state using a new algorithm we present here, which also incorporates a mean-field dynamo model to control the magnetic field strength present in the merger remnant. Our results show that -- in the most optimistic case -- corrections to the anisotropy can be in excess of $10\%$, and are potentially largest in the outer layers of the remnant. This work paves the way for a systematic investigation of these effects.</description>

      <title>New Exceptional EFTs in de Sitter Space from Generalised Energy Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a surprising relationship between exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in de Sitter space and a notion of \textit{generalised energy conservation} (GEC) of an S-matrix defined in an extended Poincar\'{e} patch of four-dimensional de Sitter. By demanding that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal, we constrain the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars living in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations. We rediscover the theories of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon, and when increasing the conformal dimension we find evidence for new exceptional theories where the four-point scalar self interactions are uniquely fixed in terms of a single coupling constant. We conjecture that for each integer conformal dimension $\Delta \geq 4$, there is at least one exceptional EFT that can be entirely fixed by GEC.</description>

      <title>Probing the peak of star formation with the stochastic background of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to map kinetic theories for spinning particles in curved space to flat space through choice of inertial frame that eliminate forces acting on momentum and spin, thus putting the idea of mimicking off-equilibrium state by metric perturbation to equilibrium state on firm ground. The equivalence has been shown for hydrodynamic and elastic regimes. In the latter case, we predict spin polarization induced by time-variation of strain in elastic matter.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on Regge-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Regge-Teitelboim model, gravity is described by embedding the space-time manifold in a (usually flat) fixed higher-dimensional background, where the embedding coordinates, rather than the metric tensor, are the dynamical degrees of freedom. Stern \&amp; Xu extended the Regge-Teitelboim framework to encompass scenarios where the background embedding space is not flat, noting that when the background is a five-dimensional de Sitter space, the Robertson-Walker manifold undergoes a transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one. Previously, we constrained this model using only low-redshift observations. Here we further explore the observational constraints on this scenario, and report significantly more stringent constraints by including high-redshift data, specifically from the cosmic microwave background. Our results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, with the putative model-specific energy component responsible for the recent acceleration being constrained to $\Omega_{RT}&lt;0.006$ and the de Sitter curvature radius in units of the Hubble constant being constrained to $LH_0&gt;1.45$, both at the 95 percent confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the less understood interaction-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Atomic Dirac energy-level dynamics and redshift in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational interaction unavoidably influences atoms and their electromagnetic radiation field in strong gravitational fields. Theoretical description of such effects using the curved metric of general relativity is limited due to the classical nature of the metric and the assumption of the local inertial frame, where gravitational interaction is absent. Here we apply unified gravity extension of the Standard Model [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] to solve the Dirac equation for hydrogen-like atoms in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field, which appears alongside all other quantum fields. We show that the gravity gauge field shifts the atomic Dirac energy levels by an amount that agrees with the experimentally observable gravitational redshift. Our result for the redshift follows directly from quantum field theory and is strictly independent of the metric-based explanation of general relativity. Furthermore, we present how gravitational potential gradient breaks the symmetry of the electric potential of the atomic nucleus, thus leading to splitting of otherwise degenerate spectral lines in strong gravitational fields. Enabling detailed spectral line analysis, our work opens novel possibilities for future investigations of quantum photonics phenomena in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>A pipeline to search for signatures of line-of-sight acceleration in gravitational wave signals produced by compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.</description>

      <title>Exploring modified Kaniadakis entropy: MOND-related theory, the Bekenstein bound conjecture, and Hawking evaporation within the Landauer principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the description of black-hole thermodynamics in terms of a recently proposed modified version for Kaniadakis entropy. We discuss the role of that proposal within the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory, a generalization of Newton's second law aimed at explaining galaxy rotation curves without resorting to dark matter. We posit a conjecture that the Kaniadakis entropy precisely describes the Bekenstein-Hawking black-hole entropy. Furthermore, we consider the Bekenstein bound conjecture which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems. We analyze that conjecture in the context of the modified Kaniadakis entropy and find that it holds for typical values of $\kappa$, as evidenced by our numerical investigation. Finally, using the Landauer principle from information theory, we derive an expression for mass loss in black hole evaporation. Our exploration underscores the potential relevance of a modified Kaniadakis statistics in understanding diverse physical phenomena, from gravitational systems to quantum mechanics, offering a promising direction for future research at the intersection among statistical mechanics and a continually increasing number of other important areas of physics.</description>

      <title>Real modes and null memory contributions in effective-one-body models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to describe real-valued $m=0$ modes from inspiral to merger and ringdown in effective-one-body models, including both oscillatory and null memory contributions. A crucial aspect of the modelization of the oscillatory part is the complexification of the real modes via a Hilbert transform. This procedure allows for an accurate description of the merger-ringdown waveform by applying standard approaches employed for the complex $m&gt;0$ modes, which include source-driven effects. The physical signal is then recovered by solely considering the real part. We apply this method in the extreme-mass-ratio regime, considering particle-driven linear gravitational perturbations in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. We then extend our description to spin-aligned, quasi-circular, comparable-mass binaries providing hierarchical fits incorporating the test-mass limit. The post-merger waveform is then matched with an inspiral effective-one-body waveform. By adopting TEOBResumS-GIOTTO as our baseline, we also include the displacement memory in the (2,0) mode through Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws, thus providing a complete effective-one-body model incorporating both oscillatory and null memory effects. The accuracy of this model is validated against the hybrid numerical relativity surrogate NRHybSur3dq8_CCE, finding, for the quadrupole of the equal mass nonspinning case, a LIGO noise-weighted mismatch of $\bar{{\cal F}} = 6\cdot 10^{-4}$ at $50 M_\odot$ for the inclination that maximizes the contribution of the (2,0) mode.</description>

      <title>Null Stream Based Third-generation-ready Glitch Mitigation for Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors routinely encounter transient noise bursts, known as glitches, which are caused by either instrumental or environmental factors. Due to their high occurrence rate, glitches can overlap with GW signals, as in the notable case of GW170817, the first detection of a binary neutron star merger. Accurate reconstruction and subtraction of these glitches is a challenging problem that must be addressed to ensure that scientific conclusions drawn from the data are reliable. This problem will intensify with third-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET) due to their higher detection rates of GWs and the longer duration of signals within the sensitivity band of the detectors. Robust glitch mitigation algorithms are, therefore, crucial for maximizing the scientific output of next-generation GW observatories. For the first time, we demonstrate how the null stream inherent in ET's unique triangular configuration can be leveraged by state-of-the-art glitch characterization methodology to essentially undo the effect of glitches for the purpose of estimating the parameters of the source. The null stream based approach enables characterization and subtraction of glitches that occur arbitrarily close to the peak of the signal without any significant effect on the quality of parameter measurements, and achieves an order of magnitude computational speed-up compared to when the null stream is not available. By contrast, without the null stream, significant biases can occur in the glitch reconstruction, which deteriorate the quality of subsequent measurements of the source parameters. This demonstrates a clear edge which the null stream can offer for precision GW science in the ET era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon propagators for power-law inflation are constructed in two one-parameter families of noncovariant gauges, in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. In both gauges photon propagators take relatively simple forms expressed in terms of scalar propagators and their derivatives. These are considerably simpler compared to their general covariant gauge counterpart. This makes feasible performing dimensionally regulated loop computations involving massless vector fields in inflation.</description>

      <title>The accretion disk and neutrino propagation of Barrow-modified Black Hole</title>

Abstract: This paper attempts to clarify the deep consequences of Barrow fractal black hole spacetime configurations caused by quantum gravity on neutrino pair annihilation and accretion disk dynamics. We systematically derive the analytical expression for the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius ($r_{\text{ISCO}}\propto M^{2/(2+\Delta)}$) by building a Barrow-modified static spherically symmetric metric ($r\rightarrow r^{1+\Delta/2}$), and we find that increasing $\Delta$ significantly shifts the ISCO inward. We numerically solve the radiation flux, effective temperature, and differential luminosity distribution under the modified metric based on the Novikov-Thorne relativistic thin accretion disk model. For $\Delta=1$, the results show that the temperature increases by $62.5\%$, the peak disk radiation flux increases by $22.5\%$, and the spectral radiance increases by around $50\%$. Fractal horizons enhance neutrino trajectory bending effects, according to further study of neutrino pair annihilation ($\nu\bar{\nu}\rightarrow e^+e^-$) energy deposition processes using local Lorentz transformations and null geodesic equations. The energy deposition rate for $\Delta=1$ is $8-28$ times higher than classical estimates when the black hole radius is $R/M\sim3-4$. This work provides important theoretical insights into the influence of quantum spacetime geometry on high-energy astrophysical phenomena in extreme gravitational fields by establishing, for the first time, quantitative relationships between the Barrow parameter $\Delta$ and neutrino pair annihilation energy and accretion disk radiative efficiency.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This letter explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a \texttt{BCO Phase Space} trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the \texttt{BCO Phase Space} can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Is the formation of primordial black holes from single-field inflation compatible with standard cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the framework of single-field inflationary models and their compatibility with the cosmological history of the Universe. Our results suggest that, depending on the masses of the formed PBHs, single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll; it necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. As an explicative example, we introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs, whose merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment.</description>

      <title>Twistorial chiral algebras in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras, which emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. We show that there are similar chiral algebras associated to integrable sectors of gauge theory and gravity whenever the spacetime dimension is an integer multiple of four. In particular, the hyperk\"ahler sector of gravity and the hyperholomorphic sector of gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions have well-known twistor descriptions giving rise to chiral algebras. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that the chiral algebras in higher-dimensions also arise as soft symmetry algebras under a certain notion of collinear limit. Interestingly, the chiral algebras and collinear limits in higher-dimensions are defined on the 2-sphere, rather than the full celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>
