      <title>Generation of Grothendieck topologies, provability and operations on subtoposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After reviewing the multiple roles of toposes - as generalized topological spaces, as universal invariants, as categorical analogues of the set-theoretic universe, and as semantic environments for first-order theories - we recall the notion of subtopos and its dual expression: both in terms of Grothendieck topologies and in terms of first-order logic. We emphasize the significance of this duality, which enables the translation of provability problems in first-order logic into problems concerning the generation of Grothendieck topologies. We also introduce the natural geometric operations, both inner and outer, on subtoposes.
  Building on these foundations, we present a new formulation of the duality between Grothendieck topologies and subtoposes, as well as the duality between topologies and closedness properties of subpresheaves. This presentation relies on general categorical principles and aims to clarify the structural relationships involved.
  We then provide two general formulas for the Grothendieck topology generated by an arbitrary family of sieves or covering families of morphisms. In addition, we refine the constructive procedures that translate logical provability into topology generation, highlighting their role in bridging logic and geometry within the topos-theoretic framework.
  Finally, we study the inner geometric operations on subtoposes: union, intersection, and difference, along with the outer adjoint operations of pushforward and pullback along topos morphisms. We prove that pullback operations preserve not only arbitrary intersections but also finite unions of subtoposes, and that pullbacks along locally connected morphisms even preserve arbitrary unions.</description>

      <title>Sites and Grothendieck toposes: an introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topos theory occupies a singular place in contemporary mathematics: born from Grothendieck's algebraic geometry, it has emerged as a unifying language for geometry, topology, algebra, and logic. This book offers a progressive introduction that moves from familiar ground - groups and their actions, topological spaces, categories, and sheaves - to Grothendieck topologies and sites, then to the axiomatic and categorical foundations of toposes (via Giraud's theorem), to their geometry (morphisms, points, subtoposes, localizations) and finally to their deep ties with geometric logic through classifying toposes. Aimed at readers with a basic familiarity with algebra, general topology, and category theory, the book emphasizes reversible viewpoints - external/internal, local/global, syntactic/semantic - guided by canonical examples, key theorems, and universal constructions. It equips the reader with a workable language in which spaces become categories of sheaves and theories become places classified by toposes. Future chapters will present "toposes as bridges" and relative toposes.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantum symmetries and ribbon tensor 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a companion work on the combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory, the author has constructed the Hopf category of quantum 2-gauge transformations $\tilde{C}=\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G}$ acting on the discrete surface-holonomy configurations on a lattice. We prove in this article that the 2-$\mathsf{Hilb}$-enriched 2-representation 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$ of finite semisimple $\mathbb{C}$-linear $\tilde C$-module categories is braided, planar-pivotal, and lax rigid, hence $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$ provides an example of a ribbon tensor 2-category. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and exhibit their coherence conditions against the rigid dagger structures. This allows one to refine the various notions of \textit{framing} in a 2-category with duals that have been previously studied in the literature. Following the 2-tangle hypothesis of Baez-Langford, framed invariants of 2-tangles can then be constructed from ribbon 2-functors into $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$, analogous to the definition of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction. We will also prove that, in the classical limit $q\rightarrow 1$, the 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_{q=1}\mathfrak{G})$ becomes strict pivotal in the sense of Douglas-Reutter.</description>
