      <title>A Space-Time Fluid (Unabridged)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This essay is a retelling of general relativity in a language in which space-time geometry is expressed as a fluid. This trivial and useful reformulation gives 1) a non-perturbative covariant description of cosmological inhomogeneities and 2) a simple formula describing how cosmic inhomogeneities are generated on super-horizon scales.
  Methods: Equating the Ricci curvature with the associated matter stress-energy gives a description of space-time geometry in terms of fluid properties. These locally measurable (covariant) non-perturbative quantities are in some ways superior to commonly used "gauge invariant" quantities. The dynamics of a quantity (kurvature) which describes cosmological inhomogeneities is described in detail. A detailed comparison is made of space-time fluid dynamics with that of a classical (Newtonian physics) fluid.
  Results: The fluid lexicon permits an unambiguous definition of the velocity of space-time. The evolution of the space-time fluid is in many ways identical with that of the classical fluid when expressed in Lagrangian coordinates. Kurvature is a measure of the specific binding energy of the fluid and is a most useful covariant measure of cosmological inhomogeneities. For plausible matter models kurvature will increase, even on super-horizon scales, due to non-linear hydrodynamic effects rather than gravity. This phenomena is also exhibited by classical fluids.
  Conclusion: The space-time fluid representation of geometrodynamics gives a simple and useful description of the evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>On the Invariant and Geometric Structure of the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the invariant structure of a Holomorphic Unified Field Theory in which gravity and gauge interactions arise from a single geometric framework. The theory is formulated using a product principal bundle, with one connection, and curvature equipped with a Hermitian field on a complexification of spacetime. From a single $\mathrm{Diff}(M)\times G$-invariant action, variation yields the Einstein and Yang-Mills equations together with their paired Bianchi identities. A compatibility condition is implemented either definitionally or through an auxiliary penalty functional. It enforces that the antisymmetric part of our Hermitian field is the gauge field's exact curvature on the real slice.</description>
