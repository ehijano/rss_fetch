      <title>Physics-based super-resolved simulation of 3D elastic wave propagation adopting scalable Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a Diffusion Transformer (referred as to DiT1D) for synthesizing realistic earthquake time histories. The DiT1D generates realistic broadband accelerograms (0-30 Hz resolution), constrained at low frequency by 3-dimensional (3D) elastodynamics numerical simulations, ensuring the fulfillment of the minimum observable physics. The DiT1D architecture, successfully adopted in super-resolution image generation, is trained on recorded single-station 3-components (3C) accelerograms. Thanks to Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) layers, we guide the DiT1D inference by enforcing the low-frequency part of the accelerogram spectrum into it. The DiT1D learns the low-to-high frequency map from the recorded accelerograms, duly normalized, and successfully transfer it to synthetic time histories. The latter are low-frequency by nature, because of the lack of knowledge on the underground structure of the Earth, demanded to fully calibrate the numerical model. We developed a CNN-LSTM lightweight network in conjunction with the DiT1D, so to predict the peak amplitude of the broadband signal from its low-pass-filtered counterpart, and rescale the normalized accelerograms rendered by the DiT1D. Despite the DiT1D being agnostic to any earthquake event peculiarities (magnitude, site conditions, etc.), it showcases remarkable zero-shot prediction realism when applied to the output of validated earthquake simulations. The generated time histories are viable input accelerograms for earthquake-resistant structural design and the pre-trained DiT1D holds a huge potential to integrate full-scale fault-to-structure digital twins of earthquake-prone regions.</description>

      <title>Dargana: fine-tuning EarthPT for dynamic tree canopy mapping from space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series foundation model that achieves specialisation using &lt;3% of its pre-training data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall, UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space, providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and conservation.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of TELEMAC-2D Models on Agricultural Flood Damage Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct economic impacts of flooding are essential for flood mitigation policies, and are based upon multiple tools, among which 2D hydrodynamic models. These models are dependent on multiple parameters and data, such as topography, and can yield considerably different results depending on their values, ultimately changing the resultant damage estimation. To help in understanding some of the underlying drivers of this variation, this conference paper compares damage estimations issued by two different hydrodynamic models of the Garonne River, near Marmande, in France. The influence of a topo-bathymetry projection method, which aims at reducing some interpolation incoherencies, was also studied. The general conclusion is that these two factors, i.e., a change in the model parameters and the topo-bathymetry projection method, do matter but their influence on the total cost estimation is highly dependent on the description of a few high-vulnerability agricultural fields. Indeed, the latter often account for the majority of the total damage even if occupying a fraction of the total area. This paper then advocates for a more vulnerability-based modelling approach, with a focus on the few high-vulnerability areas.</description>

      <title>Deep Reparameterization for Full Waveform Inversion: Architecture Benchmarking, Robust Inversion, and Multiphysics Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution subsurface imaging technique, but its effectiveness is limited by challenges such as noise contamination, sparse acquisition, and artifacts from multiparameter coupling. To address these limitations, this study develops a deep reparameterized FWI (DR-FWI) framework, in which subsurface parameters are represented by a deep neural network. Instead of directly optimizing the parameters, DR-FWI optimizes the network weights to reconstruct them, thereby embedding structural priors and facilitating optimization. To provide benchmark guidelines for the design of DR-FWI, we conduct a comparative analysis of three representative architectures (U-Net, CNN, MLP) combined with two initial model embedding strategies: one pretraining the network to generate predefined initial models (pretraining-based), while the other directly adds network outputs to the initial models. Extensive ablation experiments show that combining CNN with pretraining-based initialization significantly enhances inversion accuracy, offering valuable insights into network design. To further understand the mechanism of DR-FWI, spectral bias analysis reveals that the network first captures low-frequency features and gradually reconstructs high-frequency details, enabling an adaptive multi-scale inversion strategy. Notably, the robustness of DR-FWI is validated under various noise levels and sparse acquisition scenarios, where its strong performance with limited shots and receivers demonstrates reduced reliance on dense observational data. Additionally, a backbone-branch structure is proposed to extend DR-FWI to multiparameter inversion, and its efficacy in mitigating cross-parameter interference is validated on a synthetic anomaly model and the Marmousi2 model. These results suggest a promising direction for joint inversion involving multiple parameters or multiphysics.</description>

      <title>On the workflow, opportunities and challenges of developing foundation model in geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence, have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years, particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>HydroStartML: A combined machine learning and physics-based approach to reduce hydrological model spin-up time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training, and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management and understanding complex environmental interactions.</description>
