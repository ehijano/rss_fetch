      <title>Slope zero tensors, uniformizing variations of Hodge structure and quotients of tube domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an equivalence between two approaches to characterizing complex-projective varieties $X$ with klt singularities and ample canonical divisor that are uniformized by bounded symmetric domains. In order to do so, we show how to construct a uniformizing variation of Hodge structure from a slope zero tensor and vice versa. As a consequence, we generalize various uniformization results of Catanese and Di Scala to the singular setting. For example, we prove that $X$ is a quotient of a bounded symmetric domain of tube type by a group acting properly discontinuously and freely in codimension one if and only if $X$ admits a slope zero tensor. As a key step in the proof, we establish the compactness of the holonomy group of the singular K\"{a}hler--Einstein metric on $X_{\mathrm{reg}}$.</description>

      <title>Weakly strongly regular uniform algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a uniform algebra A on a compact Hausdorff space X and a point x in X, denote by M_x the ideal of functions in A that vanish at x and by J_x the ideal of functions in A that vanish on a neighborhood of x. It is shown that for each integer m greater than or equal to 2, there exists a compact plane set K containing the origin such that in R(K) the closure of J_x contains M_x for every x in K minus {0} and the closure of J_0 contains M_0^m but does not contain M_0^{m-1}. This result establishes a recent conjecture of Alexander Izzo. For the proof we introduce a construction that could be described as taking square roots of Swiss cheeses.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed as models for random dendritic growth in two dimensions, and as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra in problems in classical function theory. These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <title>From amoebas to pluripotential theory on hybrid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>
