      <title>Histopathology-centered Computational Evolution of Spatial Omics: Integration, Mapping, and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial omics (SO) technologies enable spatially resolved molecular profiling, while hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) imaging remains the gold standard for morphological assessment in clinical pathology. Recent computational advances increasingly place H&amp;E images at the center of SO analysis, bridging morphology with transcriptomic, proteomic, and other spatial molecular modalities, and pushing resolution toward the single-cell level. In this survey, we systematically review the computational evolution of SO from a histopathology-centered perspective and organize existing methods into three paradigms: integration, which jointly models paired multimodal data; mapping, which infers molecular profiles from H&amp;E images; and foundation models, which learn generalizable representations from large-scale spatial datasets. We analyze how the role of H&amp;E images evolves across these paradigms from spatial context to predictive anchor and ultimately to representation backbone in response to practical constraints such as limited paired data and increasing resolution demands. We further summarize actionable modeling directions enabled by current architectures and delineate persistent gaps driven by data, biology, and technology that are unlikely to be resolved by model design alone. Together, this survey provides a histopathology-centered roadmap for developing and applying computational frameworks in SO.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Pooling and Explainability in Graph Neural Networks for Tumor and Tissue-of-Origin Classification Using RNA-seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical pooling and multiple convolution layers for cancer classification based on RNA-seq data. We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures. Overall, while deeper GNN architectures did not improve performance, the hierarchical pooling structure provided valuable insights into tumor biology, making GNNs a promising tool for cancer biomarker discovery and interpretation</description>

      <title>Estimators for Substitution Rates in Genomes from Read Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the mutation rate between two sequences from noisy sequencing reads. Existing alignment-free methods typically assume direct access to the full sequences. We extend these methods to the sequencing framework, where only noisy reads from the sequences are observed. We use a simple model in which both mutations and sequencing errors are substitutions. We propose multiple estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for one of them, and evaluate the others through simulations.</description>

      <title>Central Dogma Transformer: Towards Mechanism-Oriented AI for Cellular Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding cellular mechanisms requires integrating information across DNA, RNA, and protein - the three molecular systems linked by the Central Dogma of molecular biology. While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene. These results suggest that AI architectures aligned with biological information flow can achieve both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability.</description>
