      <title>Molecular Similarity in Machine Learning of Energies in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting molecular properties in chemical reaction networks with reduced computational cost. However, accurately predicting energies of transition state (TS) structures remains a challenge due to their distinct electronic characteristics compared to stable intermediates. In this work, we investigate the limitations of structural descriptors in capturing electronic differences between minima and TS structures. We explore $\Delta$-machine learning approaches to predict correlation energy corrections using both Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) as reference methods. Our results demonstrate that learning the energy difference between DFT and coupled cluster methods outperforms direct learning and HF-based $\Delta$-learning. We also assess the effectiveness of combining electronic descriptors with structural ones but find that simple electronic features do not significantly enhance the prediction of TS energies. These findings highlight the need for more sophisticated descriptors or integrated approaches to accurately predict the electronic energies of TS structures within chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Does chemistry need more physics ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this mini-review I look into the physics underlying the theory of electronic structure of atoms and molecules. Quantum mechanics is needed to understand the structure of the periodic table. Special relativity is indispensable for a correct description of the chemistry of the heavy elements. With increased accuracy of quantum chemical calculations, it is natural to ask if chemistry needs more physics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Two-Electron Contributions within Exact Two-Component Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of relativistic exact two-component (X2C) theory is briefly reviewed, with an emphasis on cost-effective treatments of relativistic two-electron contributions by means of model potential (MP) techniques and closely related atomic mean-field (AMF) approaches. The correct MP or AMF contribution to the electronic energy is elucidated. The performance of one-center approximations to relativistic two-electron contributions is carefully assessed using benchmark calculations of molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a plain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall Single-crystal Gold Nanoelectrodes towards Advanced Chemical Probing and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-wall metal ultramicro- and nanoelectrodes (UMEs/NEs), especially gold NEs, are indispensable for high-resolution electrochemical microscopy, biosensing, and fundamental research. However, their damage susceptibility and the lack of scalable fabrication methods hinder broader adoption. We present a versatile wet-chemical approach for high-throughput fabrication of thin-wall Au NEs/UMEs and multifunctional NEs with ~80% reproducibility. This method is based on a unique template-assisted 1D growth of single-crystalline Au in borosilicate nanopipettes followed by electrochemical contacting with tungsten microwires, and focused ion beam milling, ensuring precise control over NEs dimensions. Adaptable to various metals and integrable in multifunctional probes, the method facilitates batch production of high-quality NEs with standardized electrical connections. Structural and electrochemical characterization reveals a twinned single-crystalline Au core, a seamless Au/glass interface, and highly stable electrochemical performance. Notably, smaller electrodes exhibit higher current densities, enhancing chemical detection sensitivity. Specifically, we demonstrate outstanding spatial (&lt; 200 nm) and current (&lt; 1 pA) resolutions, low limit of detection (~11.0 {\mu}M) and high stability (7 h) in scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM), by detecting photo-oxidation reaction on atomically smooth Au micro-flakes. We also demonstrate growth in double-barrel pipettes for SECM/SICM probes as well as Pt NEs. Overall, this scalable method addresses longstanding challenges in NEs, paving the way for advanced electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical microscopy, including SERS/TERS integration. With single-crystalline surfaces, these electrodes open new frontiers in catalysis, interfacial electrochemistry, biosensing, and molecular-scale investigations.</description>

      <title>Molecular Determinants of Orthosteric-allosteric Dual Inhibition of PfHT1 by Computational Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.</description>

      <title>Classifying destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions: Towards molecular quantum rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.</description>

      <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen-doped GNRs (O-doped chevron-GNR and O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O-doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron-GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)-GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2-hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Coil-Globule Transitions and Aggregation in Homopolymer Aqueous Solutions: Simulation and Topological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and topological behavior of interacting hydrophobic polymer chains in aqueous solutions by combining molecular dynamics simulations with circuit topology (CT) analysis. Combining geometric observables such as the radius of gyration and degree of aggregation with CT data we are able to capture the relationship between the coil-globule and aggregation transitions, resolving the underlying organizational changes of the system. Our results uncover a clear temperature-driven collective transition from isolated coiled polymers to aggregated globular clusters. This transition is reflected not only in conventional geometric descriptors but also in a striking reorganization of CT motifs: from dominant intrachain motifs at low temperatures to a rich ensemble of multichain motifs as temperature increases. We demonstrate that CT motif enumeration reproduces standard contact statistics via combinatorics while simultaneously providing a higher-order, topologically informed view of polymer organization. These findings highlight the power of CT as a structural descriptor for complex soft-matter systems and suggest broad applicability to biologically relevant phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we first provided a brief overview of cellulose structures, categorizing various types of nanocellulose based on their production methods, and discussed different photonic structures such as cholesteric phases, photonic crystals, distributed Bragg reflectors, and inverse photonic structures. We then reviewed some models that predict optical properties, including refractive index, scattering, reflection, and birefringence, highlighting factors that can influence these properties, such as electric field, surface roughness, temperature, and density, among others. Following this, we explored recent advancements in predicting optical properties, particularly the use of AI-driven algorithms to enhance the prediction of optical behaviors in nanomaterials. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the latest developments in nonlinear optical phenomena and chiroptical responses in nanocellulose-based materials, focusing on circularly polarized luminescence, structural colors, structural correlations, the impact of enantiomers, and more.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Role of Transition Metals and Polyanionic Frameworks in Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing research in the area of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), providing more affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. Polyanionic compounds have emerged as promising options due to their stable structure and ability to withstand high-voltage conditions as well as fast charging capabilities. This review offers a thorough discussion of phosphate-based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs, exploring their structure, electrochemical performance with various transition metals, and existing challenges. We discuss different polyanionic frameworks, such as ortho-phosphates, fluoro-phosphates, pyro-phosphates, mix pyro-phosphates, and NASICON-based phosphates, highlighting their unique structural characteristics and ability to perform well across a wide potential range. Further, we delve into the mechanisms governing sodium storage and tunability of redox potentials in polyanionic materials, providing insights into the factors that affect their electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential avenues for the practical applications of polyanionic high-voltage cathodes in sodium-ion battery technologies.</description>

      <title>Dimer in the Hubbard model. Exact and approximate solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Vib2Mol: from vibrational spectra to molecular structures-a versatile deep learning model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There will be a paradigm shift in chemical and biological research, to be enabled by autonomous, closed-loop, real-time self-directed decision-making experimentation. Spectrum-to-structure correlation, which is to elucidate molecular structures with spectral information, is the core step in understanding the experimental results and to close the loop. However, current approaches usually divide the task into either database-dependent retrieval and database-independent generation and neglect the inherent complementarity between them. In this study, we proposed Vib2Mol, a general deep learning model designed to flexibly handle diverse spectrum-to-structure tasks according to the available prior knowledge by bridging the retrieval and generation. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, even for the most demanding Raman spectra, over previous models in predicting reaction products and sequencing peptides as well as analyzing experimental spectra and integrating multi-modal spectral data. Vib2Mol enables vibrational spectroscopy a real-time guide for autonomous scientific discovery workflows.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids</title>

Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction for large-scale electronic structure calculations with a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is an approach for quantum chemical calculations using current quantum computers. In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM Quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.75\% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1\% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.</description>

      <title>Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions</title>

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Complexity and Computational Capabilites of Proteinoid Spike Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteinoids, as soft matter fluidic systems, are computational substrates that have been recently proposed for their analog computing capabilities. Such systems exhibit oscillatory electrical activity because of cationic and anionic exchange inside and outside such gels. It has also been recently shown that this (analog) electrical activity, when sampled at fixed time intervals, can be used to reveal their underlying information-theoretic, computational code. This code, for instance, can be expressed in the (digital) language of Boolean gates and QR codes. Though, this might seem as a good evidence that proteinoid substrates have computing abilities when subjected to analog-to-digital transition, the leap from their underlying computational code to computing abilities is not well demonstrated. In this work, we analyse the electrical activity patterns of proteinoid substrates using computational methods including deep ReLU networks. Our findings suggest intriguing parallels between these patterns and certain computational frameworks, hinting at the possibility that such chemical systems might possess inherent information-processing and computational capabilities. To demonstrate the computational ability, we construct a prediction algorithm which acts as a binary classification model and extract 16-dimensional vector data from the proteinoid spike, in order to perform predictions with 70.41% accuracy. This model in its core has a unique transformation modality, inspired from number-theoretic sieve theory, and is combination of two functions: spiral sampling F1 and significant digit extraction F2 functions. The complexity of the transformed data is measured using eight distinct metrics, and effectively, using a single meta-metric.</description>
