      <title>Odd Active Solids: Vortices, Velocity Oscillations and Dissipation-Free Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of physical and biological systems, including colloidal magnets, granular spinners, and starfish embryos, are characterized by strongly rotating units that give rise to odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These active systems can be described using a coarse-grained model in which the pairwise forces between particles include a transverse component compared to standard interactions due to a central potential. These non-potential, additional forces, referred to as odd interactions, do not conserve energy or angular momentum and induce rotational motion. Here, we study a two-dimensional crystal composed of inertial Brownian particles that interact via odd forces and are in thermal contact with their environment. In the underdamped regime, the energy injected by odd forces can counteract dissipation due to friction, leading to quasi-dissipation-free excitations with finite frequency and wavelength. In the resulting non-equilibrium steady state, the system exhibits angular momentum and velocity correlations. When the strength of the odd forces exceeds a certain threshold or friction is too low, a crystal with only harmonic springs becomes linearly unstable due to transverse fluctuations. This instability can be mitigated by introducing nonlinear central interactions, which suppress the divergence of short-wavelength velocity fluctuations and allows us to numerically explore the linearly unstable regime. This is characterized by pronounced temporal oscillations in the velocity featuring the existence of vortex structures and kinetic temperature values larger than the thermal temperature.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Long-range Hard-wall Repulsion between Polymers in Solvent Mixtures and Its Implication for Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of polymers in solvent mixtures is a widely-used model to represent biomolecular condensates in intracellular environments. Here, we apply a variational theory to control the center-of-mass of two polymers and perform the first quantification of their interactions in solvent mixtures. Even both solvent and cosolvent are good to the polymer, we demonstrate that strong polymer-cosolvent affinity induces the formation of a single-chain condensate. Even though all the molecular interactions are soft, the potential of mean force between two condensates exhibits an anomalous feature of long-range hard-wall repulsion, which cannot be categorized into any existing types of inter-chain interactions. This repulsion is enhanced as either the affinity or the bulk cosolvent fraction increases. The underlying mechanism is cosolvent regulation manifested as a discontinuous local condensation of cosolvent. The hard-wall repulsion provides a kinetic barrier to prevent coalescence of condensates and hence highlights the intrinsic role of proteins as a cosolvent in stabilizing biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Confined colloidal droplets dry to form circular mazes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During drying, particle-laden sessile droplets will leave so-called coffee-stain rings behind. This phenomenon is well-known and well-understood (Deegan et al., Nature {\bf 389},827-829 (1997)). Here we show that when particle-laden droplets confined in a slit are allowed to evaporate very slowly, they do not deposit coffee rings, but form a surprisingly intricate, circular maze-like pattern. We present experiments that illustrate this pattern formation and discuss the factors that determine when such patterns can form. We are not aware of reports of natural examples of the formation of such beautiful patterns under confinement, although it seems likely that they exist.</description>

      <title>Translational diffusion in supercooled water at and near the glass transition temperature -- 136 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of amorphous solid water at and near the calorimetric glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$, of 136 K have been debated for years. One hypothesis is that water turns into a "true" liquid at $T_{g}$ (i.e., it becomes ergodic) and exhibits all the characteristics of an ergodic liquid, including translational diffusion. A competing hypothesis is that only rotational motion becomes active at $T_{g}$, while the "real" glass transition in water is at a considerably higher temperature. To address this dispute, we have investigated the diffusive mixing in nanoscale water films, with thicknesses up to ~100 nm, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The experiments used films that were composed of at least 90% $H_{2}O$ with $D_{2}O$ making up the balance and were conducted in conditions where H/D exchange was essentially eliminated. Because the IR spectra of multilayer $D_{2}O$ films (e.g., thicknesses of ~3 - 6 nm) embedded within thick $H_{2}O$ films are distinct from the spectrum of isolated $D_{2}O$ molecules within $H_{2}O$, the diffusive mixing of (initially) isotopically layered water films could be followed as a function of annealing time and temperature. The results show that water films with total thicknesses ranging from ~20 to 100 nm diffusively mixed prior to crystallization for temperatures between 120 and 144 K. The translational diffusion had an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of 40.8 kJ/mol, which indicates that water at and near $T_{g}$ is a strong liquid. The measured diffusion coefficient at 136 K is 6.25 x 10$^{-21} m^{2}/s$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Bottom-Heavy Janus Particle Near a Wall Under Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, Brownian Dynamics simulations are implemented to investigate the motion of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall under varying shear flow conditions and at small P\'eclet (Pe) numbers. The stochastic motion of the Janus particle impacted by surface forces is described using a set of coupled Langevin equations that takes into account the Janus particle orientation. Interactions arising from surface potentials are found to depend on the separation distance between the Janus particle and the wall, the properties of the surfaces involved, and the thickness of the Janus particle cap. When shear flow is introduced in the system, the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle is also governed by the strain rate. Furthermore, the effect of friction on the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle under shear flow is investigated and reveals that the rotational motion of the Janus particle slows down slightly when the particle is close to the surface. In summary, we demonstrate the ability to utilize Brownian Dynamics simulations to capture the rich dynamical behavior of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall and under a range of shear flow conditions, cap thicknesses, and surface charges.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Mechanics of Non-Euclidean Curved-Crease Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.</description>

      <title>Silver(I) complexes with nitrile ligands: new materials with versatile applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, the structure, thermal stability, conductive properties, and antimicrobial activity of silver(I) complexes with nitrile ligands were investigated. For the construction of the materials, 2 cyanopyridine (2-cpy), 4-cyanopyridine (4-cpy), 1,2-dicyanobenzene (1,2-dcb), and 1,3 dicyanobenzene (1,3-dcb) were used in addition to the silver nitrite and nitrate. Four new compounds were isolated and structurally characterized: one molecular complex [Ag4(1,2-dcb)4(NO3)4], two 1-D coordination polymers [Ag2(2-cpy)2(NO2)2], [Ag3(1,3-dcb)2(NO3)2] and one 3-D coordination polymer [Ag(4-cpy)(NO2)]. The results indicate that the nitrite complexes display good antimicrobial properties against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. The presence of weakly coordinating CN groups increases the release of silver ions into the bacterial and yeast cell environments. Moreover, these materials exhibit unusual electrical properties in thin-layer devices. On the other hand, the nitrite and nitrate counterions give rise to the low thermal stability of the complexes.</description>

      <title>Experimental Modeling of Chiral Active Robots and a Minimal Model of Non-Gaussian Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design 3D-printed motor-driven active particles and find that their dynamics can be characterized using the model of overdamped chiral active Brownian particles (ABPs), as demonstrated by measured angular statistics and translational mean squared displacements (MSDs). Furthermore, we propose a minimal model that reproduces the double-peak velocity distributions and further predicts a transition from the single-peak to the double-peak displacement distributions in short-time regimes. The model provides a clear physics picture of these phenomena, originating from the competition between the active motion and the translational diffusion. Our experiments confirm such picture. The minimal model enhances our understanding of activity-driven non-Gaussian phenomena. The designed particles could be further applied in the study of collective chiral motions.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of wave-propelled capillary spinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</description>

      <title>Shape of a membrane on a liquid interface with arbitrary curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. Working first at small slopes, we determine the shape of the sheet analytically in the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Numerical energy minimization confirm our predictions and show that this behavior holds for finite slopes. Experiments on a thin polystyrene film at an anisotropic air-water interface show consistent behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral active particles are able to draw energy from the environment to self-propel in the form of rotation. We describe an experimental arrangement wherein chiral objects, spinners, floating on the surface of a vibrated fluid rotate due to emitted capillary waves. We observe that pairs of spinners can assemble at quantized distances via the mutually generated wavefield, phase synchronize and, in some circumstances, globally rotate about a point midway between them. A mathematical model based on wave-mediated interactions captures the salient features of the assembly and synchronization while a qualitative argument is able to rationalize global rotations based on interference and radiation stress associated with the wavefield. Extensions to larger collections are demonstrated, highlighting the potential for this tabletop system to be used as an experimental system capable of synchronizing and swarming.</description>

      <title>Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>
