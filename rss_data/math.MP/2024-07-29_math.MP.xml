      <title>Cubic algebras, induced representations and general solution of the exceptional Laguerre equation $X_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the case of exceptional Laguerre polynomials $X_1$ of type I, II and III, their ordinary differential equations and the problem of finding general solution beside the polynomial part. We will develop an algebraic approach based on the Schrodinger form of the problem and associate representations of the underlying spectrum generating algebra. We use the Darboux-Crum transformation to construct ladder operators of fourth order for the case of the exceptional Laguerre polynomials $X_1$ of type I, II and III. We then obtain all zero modes for the lowering and raising operators. We construct the induced representation for the linearly independent solutions, including the polynomial states. Those states forming the general solution are important non only in the construction of wider set of physical states satisfying different boundary conditions, but also in context of getting isospectral deformations. Our approach, allows to provide a completely algebraic construction of the two linearly independent solutions of the ordinary differential equation of the exceptional orthogonal polynomials of Laguerre type $X_1$ ( case I, II and III). The analogue of Rodrigues formulas for the general solution are constructed. The set of finite states from which the other states can be obtained algebraically is not unique but the vanishing arrow and diagonal arrow from the diagram of the 2-chain representations can be used to obtain minimal sets. These Rodrigues formulas are then exploited, not only to construct all the states (polynomial and non-polynomial), in a purely algebraic way, but also to obtain coefficients from the action of the ladder operators also in an algebraic manner. Those results are established via higher commutation relations related to the cubic Heisenberg Weyl algebra.</description>

      <title>On the energy transfer towards large values of wavenumbers for solutions of 4-wave kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the fundamental work of Escobedo and Velazquez \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB,EscobedoVelazquez:2015:OTT}, we prove that solutions of 4-wave kinetic equations, under very general forms of the dispersion relations, exhibit the transfer of energy towards large values of wavenumbers as time evolves. We also provide a global well-posedness theory for mild solutions of the equation under general forms of the dispersion relations.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the pioneering work of Escobedo and Velazquez \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB,EscobedoVelazquez:2015:OTT}, we prove that solutions of 4-wave kinetic equations, under very general forms of dispersion relations, develop condensation at the origin in finite time, under weaker conditions on the initial data than the ones considered in \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB,EscobedoVelazquez:2015:OTT}. We also provide some estimates on the non-condensation times of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Point Charges Interacting with Quasi-classical Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study effective models describing systems of quantum particles interacting with quantized (electromagnetic) fields in the quasi-classical regime, i.e., when the field's state shows a large average number of excitations. Once the field's degrees of freedom are traced out on factorized states, the reduced dynamics of the particles' system is described by an effective Schr\"{o}dinger operator keeping track of the field's state. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the latter, such effective models are well-posed even if the particles are point-like, that is no ultraviolet cut-off is imposed on the interaction with quantum fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work we showcased the factorization method to find the symmetries of superintegrable systems with spherical separability in flat spaces. Here we analyze the same problem, but in constant curvature spaces along the examples of curved Kepler-Coulomb and Harmonic Oscillator systems. We also show how this procedure can also be directly extended to the curved Smorodinsky-Winternitz (SW) and Evans systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamilton spaces: new developments and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we make new developments in generic cotangent bundle geometries, depending on all phase-space variables. In particular, we will focus on the so-called generalized Hamilton spaces, discussing how the main ingredients of this geometrical framework, such as the Hamiltonian and the nonlinear and affine connections, can be derived from a given metric. Several properties of this kind of spaces are demonstrated for autoparallel Hamiltonians. Moreover, we study the spacetime and momentum isometries of the metric. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of cotangent bundle geometries in quantum gravity, such as the construction of deformed relativistic kinematics and non-commutative spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Knotted optical fields: Seifert fibrations, braided open books and topological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for studying knotted and braided configurations of optical fields, moving beyond the conventional Hopfion solution based on the Hopf fibration. By employing the Seifert fibration, a preferred framing is introduced to characterize the ``knottiness" of tubular neighbourhoods of knots embedded in the 3-sphere. This approach yields a specific presentation of Seifert surfaces and facilitates the description of knotted optical fields, drawing on an enriched version of Ra\~{n}ada's formulation. The relation between knots and braids enables one to explore the connections between configurations generated experimentally through the controlled over- and under-crossings of light beams, and concepts from geometric group theory and algebraic topology. This framework, emphasizing the significance of ``braided open books", sheds light on topological constraints inherent in classes of braids suitable for representing interlaced optical fields. These constraints primarily pertain to braids with $n\leq3$ strands -- aligning with existing experimental implementations -- and homogeneous braids with any number of strands. This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and manipulating knotted optical fields, suggesting potential applications and avenues for further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Exponentially fast selection of sectors for quantum trajectories beyond non demolition measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in long time, quantum trajectories select an invariant subspace of the Hilbert space of the system being indirectly measured. This selection is shown to be exponentially fast in an almost sure sense and in average. This result generalizes a known result for non demolition measurements to arbitrary repeated indirect measurements. Our proofs are based on the introduction of a deformation of the original instrument to an equivalent one with a unique invariant state.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter (D. Nakamura et al., arXiv:2407.09458), we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Entanglement Generation and Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the generating and transfer of entanglement during adiabatic interactions can be traced to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps of eigenvectors weave the entanglement in multi-partite systems. The efficiency of this weaving of entanglement depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and it is, therefore, constraining the speed of adiabatic evolution. This relates an adiabatic quantum computation's complexity, as measured by its minimum duration, to that quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement. To derive these results, we employ the spectral theorem to decompose interaction Hamiltonians into rank-one projectors and we then use the adiabatic theorem to successively adiabatically introduce these projectors. For each projector activation, using recent exact results on the behaviour of eigensystems under the addition of Hamiltonians, we can then non-perturbatively calculate the entanglement dynamics. Our findings provide new tools for the analysis and control of the dynamics of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Integral Regulators on Mirror Curves with Mass Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18356v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Codesido-Grassi-Marino laid the foundation of a connection between local CY 3-folds and the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves in the context of Topological String Theory. In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and M. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>IDEAL characterization of vacuum pp-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An IDEAL characterization of a particular spacetime metric, $g_0$, consists of a set of tensorial equations $T[g] = 0$ arising from expressions constructed from the metric, $g$, its curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives and which are satisfied if and only if $g$ is locally isometric to the original metric $g_0$. Earlier applications of the IDEAL classification of spacetimes relied on the construction of particular scalar polynomial curvature invariants as an important step in the procedure.
  In this paper we investigate the well-known class of vacuum pp-wave spacetimes, where all scalar polynomial curvature invariants vanish, and determine the applicability of an IDEAL classification for these spacetimes. We consider a modification of the IDEAL approach which permits a corresponding extension of the Stewart-Walker lemma. With this change, we are able to construct invariants and IDEAL-ly classify all of the vacuum pp-wave solutions which admit a two- or higher-dimensional isometry group, with the exception of one case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify spin ALE ancient Ricci flows and spin ALE expanding solitons with suitable groups at infinity. In particular, the only spin ancient Ricci flows with groups at infinity in $SU(2)$ and mild decay at infinity are hyperk\"ahler ALE metrics. The main idea of the proof, of independent interest, consists in showing that the large-scale behavior of Perelman's $\mu$-functional on any ALE orbifold with non-negative scalar curvature is controlled by a renormalized $\lambda_{\mathrm{ALE}}$-functional related to a notion of weighted mass.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The states are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. Our results give a geometric meaning to the Hill-Wootters concurrence C since L coincides with C. Furthermore, unlike C, the measure L distinguishes the rank of states with maximum entanglement. We construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</description>

      <title>Random normal matrices: eigenvalue correlations near a hard wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pair correlation functions for planar Coulomb systems in the pushed phase, near a ring-shaped impenetrable wall. We assume coupling constant $\Gamma=2$ and that the number $n$ of particles is large. We find that the correlation functions decay slowly along the edges of the wall, in a narrow interface stretching a distance of order $1/n$ from the hard edge. At distances much larger than $1/\sqrt{n}$, the effect of the hard wall is negligible and pair correlation functions decay very quickly, and in between sits an interpolating interface that we call the ``semi-hard edge''.
  More precisely, we provide asymptotics for the correlation kernel $K_{n}(z,w)$ as $n\to\infty$ in two microscopic regimes (with either $|z-w| = \mathcal{O} (1/\sqrt{n})$ or $|z-w| = \mathcal{O} (1/n)$), as well as in three macroscopic regimes (with $|z-w| \asymp 1$). For some of these regimes, the asymptotics involve oscillatory theta functions and weighted Szeg\H{o} kernels.</description>

Abstract: By twisting the spectral triple of a riemannian spin manifold, we show how to generate an orthogonal and geodesic preserving torsion from a torsionless Dirac operator. We identify the group of twisted unitaries as the generator of torsion with co-exact three form. Through the fermionic action, the torsion term identifies with a Lorentzian energy-momentum 4-vector. The Lorentz group turns out to be a normal subgroup of the twisted unitaries. We also investigate the spectral action related to this model.</description>

      <title>Canonical Lifts in Multisymplectic De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define canonical lifts of vector fields to the multisymplectic multimomentum bundles of De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian first-order field theories and to the appropriate premultisymplectic embedded constraint submanifolds on which singular field theories are studied. These new canonical lifts are used to study the so-called natural Noether symmetries present in both regular and singular Hamiltonian field theories along with their associated conserved quantities obtained from Noether's theorem. The Klein-Gordon field, the Polyakov bosonic string, and Einstein-Cartan gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions are analyzed in depth as applications of these concepts; as a peripheral result obtained in the analysis of the bosonic string, we provide a new geometrical interpretation of the well-known Virasoro constraint.</description>

      <title>Which symmetry group for elementary particles with an electric charge today and in the past?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding $G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some idea, which leads to a non-trivial solution of the quantum four-simplex equation, is exposed in this paper. We call this idea "pentagonal algebra". Few examples of the realisation of this idea are given here, and thus few examples of $R$-matrix for the quantum four-simplex equation are presented.</description>

      <title>On the Support of Anomalous Dissipation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of a unifying measure-theoretic approach, we establish lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the space-time set which can support anomalous dissipation for weak solutions of fluid equations, both in the presence or absence of a physical boundary. Boundary dissipation, which can occur at both the time and the spatial boundary, is analyzed by suitably modifying the Duchon &amp; Robert interior distributional approach. One implication of our results is that any bounded Euler solution (compressible or incompressible) arising as a zero viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes solutions cannot have anomalous dissipation supported on a set of dimension smaller than that of the space. This result is sharp, as demonstrated by entropy-producing shock solutions of compressible Euler and by recent constructions of dissipative incompressible Euler solutions, as well as passive scalars. For $L^q_tL^r_x$ suitable Leray-Hopf solutions of the $d-$dimensional Navier-Stokes equation we prove a bound of the dissipation in terms of the Parabolic Hausdorff measure soon as the solution lies in the Prodi-Serrin class. In the three-dimensional case, this matches with the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg partial regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give series solutions to single insertion place propagator-type systems of Dyson--Schwinger equations using binary tubings of rooted trees. These solutions are combinatorially transparent in the sense that each tubing has a straightforward contribution. The Dyson--Schwinger equations solved here are more general than those previously solved by chord diagram techniques, including systems and non-integer values of the insertion parameter $s$. We remark on interesting combinatorial connections and properties.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of Legendre-type transformations for a Frobenius manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional Frobenius manifold. Fix $\kappa\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. Assuming certain invertibility, Dubrovin introduced the Legendre-type transformation $S_\kappa$, which transforms $M$ to an $n$-dimensional Frobenius manifold $S_\kappa(M)$. In this paper, we show that these $S_\kappa(M)$ share the same monodromy data at the Fuchsian singular point of the Dubrovin connection, and that for the case when $M$ is semisimple they also share the same Stokes matrix and the same central connection matrix. A straightforward application of the monodromy identification is the following: if we know the monodromy data of some semisimple Frobenius manifold $M$, we immediately obtain those of its Legendre-type transformations. Another application gives the identification between the $\kappa$th partition function of a semisimple Frobenius manifold $M$ and the topological partition function of $S_{\kappa}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Strong decay of correlations for Gibbs states in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems in thermal equilibrium are described using Gibbs states. The correlations in such states determine how difficult it is to describe or simulate them. In this article, we show that if the Gibbs state of a quantum system satisfies that each of its marginals admits a local effective Hamiltonian with short-range interactions, then it satisfies a mixing condition, that is, for any regions $A$, $C$ the distance of the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ on these regions to the product of its marginals,
  $$\| \rho_{AC} \rho_A^{-1} \otimes \rho_C^{-1} - 1_{AC}\|\, ,$$
  decays exponentially with the distance between regions $A$ and $C$. This mixing condition is stronger than other commonly studied measures of correlation. In particular, it implies the exponential decay of the mutual information between distant regions. The mixing condition has been used, for example, to prove positive log-Sobolev constants. On the way, we prove that the the condition regarding local effective Hamiltonian is satisfied if the Hamiltonian of the system is commuting and also commutes with every marginal of the Gibbs state. The proof of these results employs a variety of tools such as Araki's expansionals, quantum belief propagation and cluster expansions.</description>

      <title>Quandles as pre-Lie skew braces, set-theoretic Hopf algebras &amp; universal R-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present connections between left non-degenerate solutions of the set-theoretic braid equation and left shelves using Drinfel'd homomorphisms. We generalize the notion of affine quandle, by using heap endomorphisms and metahomomorphisms, and identify the underlying Yang-Baxter algebra for solutions of the braid equation associated to a given quandle. We introduce the notion of the pre-Lie skew brace and identify certain affine quandles that give rise to pre-Lie skew braces. Generalisations of the braiding of a group, associated to set-theoretic solutions of the braid equation are also presented. These generalized structures encode part of the underlying Hopf algebra. We then introduce the quasi-triangular (quasi) Hopf algebras and universal R-matrices for rack and set-theoretic algebras. Generic set-theoretic solutions coming from heap endomorphisms are also identified.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of the monomial Uglov matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a resolution to the problem of $\beta$-deforming the non-Gaussian monomial matrix models. The naive guess of substituting Schur polynomials with Jack polynomials does not work in that case, therefore, we are forced to look for another basis for superintegrability. We find that the relevant symmetric functions are given by Uglov polynomials, and that the integration measure should also be deformed. The measure appears to be related to the Uglov limit as well, when the quantum parameters $(q,t)$ go to a root of unity. The degree of the root must be equal to the degree of the potential. One cannot derive these results directly, for example, by studying Virasoro constraints. Instead, we use the recently developed techniques of $W$-operators to arrive at the root of unity limit. From the perspective of matrix models this new example demonstrates that even with a rather nontrivial integration measure one can find a superintegrability basis by studying the hidden symmetry of the moduli space of deformations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a higher-dimension Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Coupled Sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling the fields may lead to the emergence of new phenomena. In the realm of classical fields and nonlinear systems, extensive research has been conducted on their solitary and soliton solutions. In the conducted studies, typically two $\phi^4$ systems, or two sine-Gordon systems, have been coupled. The sine-Gordon system exhibits diverse solutions, all well-behaved, with its soliton solutions fully understood. On the other hand, the $\phi^4$ system, which is significant in field theory, has solitary solutions, but these solutions are not solitonic. For example, from a pair of kink and antikink, we cannot construct a bound state; or that after a collision, these two solutions do not revert to their initial status and become disrupted. In this study, we couple a $\phi^4$ system with a sine-Gordon system to impart stability from the sine-Gordon system to the $\phi^4$ system. We have demonstrated that for a coupled $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon system, this expectation is somewhat met.</description>
