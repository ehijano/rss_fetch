      <title>FASTR: Reimagining FASTQ via Compact Image-inspired Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables population-scale genomics but generates massive datasets, creating bottlenecks in storage, transfer, and analysis. FASTQ, the standard format for over two decades, stores one byte per base and one byte per quality score, leading to inefficient I/O, high storage costs, and redundancy. Existing compression tools can mitigate some issues, but often introduce costly decompression or complex dependency issues. Results: We introduce FASTR, a lossless, computation-native successor to FASTQ that encodes each nucleotide together with its base quality score into a single 8-bit value. FASTR reduces file size by at least 2x while remaining fully reversible and directly usable for downstream analyses. Applying general-purpose compression tools on FASTR consistently yields higher compression ratios, 2.47, 3.64, and 4.8x faster compression, and 2.34, 1.96, 1.75x faster decompression than on FASTQ across Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads. FASTR is machine-learning-ready, allowing reads to be consumed directly as numerical vectors or image-like representations. We provide a highly parallel software ecosystem for FASTQ-FASTR conversion and show that FASTR integrates with existing tools, such as minimap2, with minimal interface changes and no performance overhead. By eliminating decompression costs and reducing data movement, FASTR lays the foundation for scalable genomics analyses and real-time sequencing workflows.

      <title>Motif Diversity in Human Liver ChIP-seq Data Using MAP-Elites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motif discovery is a core problem in computational biology, traditionally formulated as a likelihood optimization task that returns a single dominant motif from a DNA sequence dataset. However, regulatory sequence data admit multiple plausible motif explanations, reflecting underlying biological heterogeneity. In this work, we frame motif discovery as a quality-diversity problem and apply the MAP-Elites algorithm to evolve position weight matrix motifs under a likelihood-based fitness objective while explicitly preserving diversity across biologically meaningful dimensions. We evaluate MAP-Elites using three complementary behavioral characterizations that capture trade-offs between motif specificity, compositional structure, coverage, and robustness. Experiments on human CTCF liver ChIP-seq data aligned to the human reference genome compare MAP-Elites against a standard motif discovery tool, MEME, under matched evaluation criteria across stratified dataset subsets. Results show that MAP-Elites recovers multiple high-quality motif variants with fitness comparable to MEME's strongest solutions while revealing structured diversity obscured by single-solution approaches.</description>

      <title>LaCoGSEA: Unsupervised deep learning for pathway analysis via latent correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18604v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Pathway enrichment analysis is widely used to interpret gene expression data. Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.
  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes. Overall, LaCoGSEA provides state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised pathway enrichment analysis.
