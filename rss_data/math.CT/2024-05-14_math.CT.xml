      <title>A simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,1)$-categories were introduced by Lurie, and they have various applications in higher category theory. Abell\'{a}n Garc\'{i}a and Stern gave a generalization to twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories. In this paper we introduce another simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractible monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$ and characterise fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal structures. Next, we give sufficient conditions for the monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{L}$ of a Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$. Our analysis is a generalization of G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, and it relies on a novel notion of $\Sigma$-tractible monoidal structure. As we will see, $\Sigma$-tractible coproducts simultaneously generalize cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts and extensive coproducts. We analyse when the closed structure is fibred -- usually it is not.</description>

      <title>A formal categorical approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a bicategory which refines the localization of the category of dg categories with respect to quasi-equivalences and investigate its properties via formal category theory. Concretely, we first introduce the bicategory of dg categories $\mathsf{DBimod}$ whose Hom categories are the derived categories of dg bimodules and then define the desired bicategory as the sub-bicategory $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr}$ consisting only of right quasi-representable dg bimodules. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of adjunctions and equivalences in these bicategories. We then show that the embedding $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{DBimod}$ is a proarrow equipment in the sense of Richard J. Wood, which is a framework for formal category theory and makes it possible to talk about (weighted) (co)limits in an abstract way. Thus we obtain the notion of homotopical (co)limits in a dg category, including homotopical shifts and cones, by which we obtain a formal categorical characterization of pretriangulated dg categories. As an immediate application we give a conceptual proof of the fact that the pretriangulatedness is preserved under the gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.
  This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>Schreier split extensions of quantale enriched monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Schreier split extensions of monoids enriched with a relation taking values on a quantale, to which we call quantale enriched monoids. Schreier split extensions play, in the setting of monoids, the role of split extensions of groups. As such, they are closely related to semidirect products of monoids. In this paper, we investigate the possible quantale-enriched structures on semidirect products of monoids appearing in a Schreier split extension. We then restrict our study to a class of quantale enriched monoids whose behavior mimics the fact that the preorder on a preordered group is completely determined by the its of positive elements. Finally, we instantiate our results for preordered monoids and compare them with existing literature.</description>

      <title>On representation categories of $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the language of monads, comonads and Eilenberg-Moore categories to describe a categorical framework for $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras, as well as $A_\infty$-modules and $A_\infty$-comodules over them respectively. The resulting formalism leads us to investigate relations between representation categories of $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras. In particular, we relate $A_\infty$-comodules and $A_\infty$-modules by considering a rational pairing between an $A_\infty$-coalgebra $C$ and an $A_\infty$-algebra $A$. The categorical framework also motivates us to introduce $A_\infty$-contramodules over an $A_\infty$-coalgebra $C$.</description>

      <title>The local-to-global principle via topological properties of the Balmer-Favi support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the theory of stratification of tensor triangulated categories via Balmer-Favi support inaugurated by Barthel, Heard and Sanders, we prove the local versions of the well-known statements that the Balmer spectrum being noetherian or profinite scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  That is, given an object $t$ of a tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ we show that if the Balmer-Favi support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is a noetherian space, then the local-to-global principle holds for $t$. In the case where the Balmer spectrum $\text{Spc}(\mathcal{T}^c)$ is profinite, if the support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is scattered then the local-to-global principle holds for the object $t$.
  We conclude with an application of the last result to the examination of the support of injective superdecomposable modules in the derived category of an absolutely flat ring which is not semi-artinian.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a purely derivator theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, we explain how our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded cochain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realised as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infinitesimal counterpart to the notion of braided category. The corresponding infinitesimal braidings are natural transformations which are compatible with an underlying braided monoidal structure in the sense that they constitute a first-order deformation of the braiding. This extends previously considered infinitesimal symmetric or Cartier categories, where involutivity of the braiding and an additional commutativity of the infinitesimal braiding with the symmetry are required. The generalized pre-Cartier framework is then elaborated in detail for the categories of (co)quasitriangular bialgebra (co)modules and we characterize the resulting infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices (resp. $\mathcal{R}$-forms) on the bialgebra. It is proven that the latter are Hochschild $2$-cocycles and that they satisfy an infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation, while they are Hochschild $2$-coboundaries under the Cartier (co)triangular assumption in the presence of an antipode. We provide explicit examples of infinitesimal braidings, particularly on quantum $2\times 2$-matrices, $\mathrm{GL}_q(2)$, Sweedler's Hopf algebra and via Drinfel'd twist deformation. As conceptual tools to produce examples of infinitesimal braidings we prove an infinitesimal version of the FRT construction and we provide a Tannaka-Krein reconstruction theorem for pre-Cartier coquasitriangular bialgebras. We comment on the deformation of infinitesimal braidings and construct a quasitriangular structure on formal power series of Sweedler's Hopf algebra.</description>
