      <title>Discrete Topological Complexities of Simplical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into the discrete TC of surjective simplicial fibrations, aiming to unravel the interplay between topological complexity, discrete geometric structures, and computational efficiency. Moreover, we examine the properties of the discrete TC number in higher dimensions and its relationship with scat. We also touch on the basic properties of the notion of higher contiguity distance, and show that it is possible to consider discrete TC computations in a simpler sense.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Persistent Homology and Spectral Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between the persistent homology and the spectral sequence of a filtered chain complex over a field. Our method is based on a decomposition of the persistent homology. We demonstrate that, under fairly general assumptions, these two algebraic structures capture the same information from the filtered chain complex.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy links of stratified cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homotopy links haven proven to be one of the most powerful tools of stratified homotopy theory. In previous work, we described combinatorial models for the generalized homotopy links of a stratified simplicial set. For many purposes, in particular to investigate the stratified homotopy hypothesis, a more general version of this result pertaining to stratified cell complexes is needed. Here we prove that, given a stratified cell complex $X$, the generalized homotopy links can be computed in terms of a certain subcomplex of a subdivision of $X$. As a consequence, it follows that homotopy links map certain pushout diagrams of stratified cell complexes into homotopy pushout diagrams. This result is crucial to the development of (semi)model structures for stratified homotopy theory in which geometric examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces, are bifibrant.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial models for stratified homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is part of a series of three articles with the objective of investigating a stratified version of the homotopy hypothesis in terms of semimodel structures that interact well with classical examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces. To this end, we prove the existence of several combinatorial simplicial model structures in the combinatorial setting of stratified simplicial sets. One of these we show to be Quillen equivalent to the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that presents the $(\infty,1)$-category of layered $(\infty,1)$-categories, i.e., such $(\infty,1)$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>A note on the Segal conjecture for large objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segal conjecture for $C_p$ (as proved by Lin and Gunawardena) asserts that the canonical map from the $p$-complete sphere spectrum to the Tate construction for the trivial action of $C_p$ on the $p$-complete sphere spectrum is an isomorphism. In this article we extend the collection of spectra for which the canonical map $X \to X^{tC_p}$ is known to be an isomorphism to include any $p$-complete, bounded below spectrum whose mod $p$ homology, viewed a module over the Steenrod algebra, is complete with respect to the maximal ideal $I \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <title>4-torsion classes in the integral cohomology of oriented Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of 4-torsion in the integral cohomology of oriented Grassmannians. We prove a general criterion for the appearance of 4-torsion classes based on (twisted) Steenrod squares and show that there are many cases where this criterion is satisfied for minimal-degree anomalous classes, assuming a conjecture on the characteristic rank. We also establish the upper bound in the characteristic rank conjecture for oriented Grassmannians $\tilde{Gr}_k(n)$, and prove the equality in the cases $k=5, n=2^t-1,2^t$ and $k=6, n=2^t$. This provides infinitely many examples of oriented Grassmannians having 4-torsion in their integral cohomology. On the way, we clarify the relation between minimal-degree anomalous classes and results of Stong on the height of the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1$ in the mod 2 cohomology of real Grassmannians, for which we give an independent proof. We also establish some bounds on torsion exponents for the integral cohomology of oriented flag manifolds. Based on these findings and further computational evidence, we formulate a conjectural relationship between the torsion exponent in the integral cohomology of homogeneous spaces and their deficiency.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified $p$-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of tropical unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$ where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify a contractible subcomplex of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected for all $g$ and $p$. In the case of genus $2$ we fully determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that commutative semirings in a cartesian closed presentable $\infty$-category, as defined by Groth, Gepner, and Nikolaus, are equivalent to product-preserving functors from the $(2,1)$-category of bispans of finite sets. In other words, we identify the latter as the Lawvere theory for commutative semirings in the $\infty$-categorical context. This implies that connective commutative ring spectra can be described as grouplike product-preserving functors from bispans of finite sets to spaces. A key part of the proof is a localization result for $\infty$-categories of spans, and more generally for $\infty$-categories with factorization systems, that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Universal Distances for Extended Persistence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.01834v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended persistence diagram is an invariant of piecewise linear functions, which is known to be stable under perturbations of functions with respect to the bottleneck distance as introduced by Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Harer. We address the question of universality, which asks for the largest possible stable distance on extended persistence diagrams, showing that a more discriminative variant of the bottleneck distance is universal. Our result applies more generally to settings where persistence diagrams are considered only up to a certain degree. We achieve our results by establishing a functorial construction and several characteristic properties of relative interlevel set homology, which mirror the classical Eilenberg--Steenrod axioms. Finally, we contrast the bottleneck distance with the interleaving distance of sheaves on the real line by showing that the latter is not intrinsic, let alone universal. This particular result has the further implication that the interleaving distance of Reeb graphs is not intrinsic either.</description>

      <title>Integral cohomology rings of weighted Grassmann orbifolds and rigidity properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce `Pl\"{u}cker weight vector' and establish the definition of a weighted Grassmann orbifold $\mbox{Gr}_{\mathbf{b}}(k,n)$, corresponding to a Pl\"{u}cker weight vector `$\mathbf{b}$'. We achieve an explicit classification of weighted Grassmann orbifolds up to certain homeomorphism in terms of the Pl\"{u}cker weight vectors. We study the integral cohomology of $\mbox{Gr}_{\bf b}(k,n)$ and provide some sufficient conditions such that the integral cohomology of $\mbox{Gr}_{\bf b}(k,n)$ has no torsion. We describe the integral equivariant cohomology ring of divisive weighted Grassmann orbifolds and compute all the equivariant structure constants with integer coefficients. Eminently, we compute the integral cohomology rings of divisive weighted Grassmann orbifolds explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a stratification tower for the equivariant slice filtration. This tower stratifies the slice spectral sequence of a $G$-spectrum $X$ into distinct regions. Within each of these regions, the differentials are determined by the localized slice spectral sequences, which compute the geometric fixed points along with their associated residue group actions. Consequently, the stratification tower offers an inductive method of understanding the entirety of the equivariant slice spectral sequence of $X$ by examining each of its distinct stratification regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discover a connection between the Milnor fibration theory and current research trends in topological robotics. The configuration space and workspace are often described as subspaces of some Euclidean spaces. The work map is a continuous map which assigns to each state of the configuration space the position of the end-effector at that state. The tasking planning problem consists in study the complexity and design of algorithms controlling the task performed by the robot manipulator. We present a characterisation of the existence of cross-sections for Milnor fibrations in terms of homotopy groups of the fiber. Then, we study the tasking planning problem for the Milnor fibration of analytic function-germs. We see that the tasking planning algorithms strongly depend of the Milnor fibration theorem. We conjecture that the topological complexity of Milnor fibration coincidences with the topological complexity of its base (a sphere).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11180v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly globular double categories are a model of weak $2$-categories based on the notion of weak globularity, and they are known to be suitably equivalent to Tamsamani $2$-categories. Fair $2$-categories, introduced by J. Kock, model weak $2$-categories with strictly associative compositions and weak unit laws. In this paper we establish a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair $2$-categories and prove they are equivalent after localisation with respect to the $2$-equivalences. This comparison sheds new light on weakly globular double categories as encoding a strictly associative, though not strictly unital, composition, as well as the category of weak units via the weak globularity condition.</description>

      <title>Internal sums for synthetic fibered $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give structural results about bifibrations of (internal) $(\infty,1)$-categories with internal sums. This includes a higher version of Moens' Theorem, characterizing cartesian bifibrations with extensive aka stable and disjoint internal sums over lex bases as Artin gluings of lex functors.
  We also treat a generalized version of Moens' Theorem due to Streicher which does not require the Beck--Chevalley condition.
  Furthermore, we show that also in this setting the Moens fibrations can be characterized via a condition due to Zawadowski.
  Our account overall follows Streicher's presentation of fibered category theory \`{a} la B\'{e}nabou, generalizing the results to the internal, higher-categorical case, formulated in a synthetic setting.
  Namely, we work inside simplicial homotopy type theory, which has been introduced by Riehl and Shulman as a logical system to reason about internal $(\infty,1)$-categories, interpreted as Rezk objects in any given Grothendieck--Rezk--Lurie $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>Trainable and Explainable Simplicial Map Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial map neural networks (SMNNs) are topology-based neural networks with interesting properties such as universal approximation ability and robustness to adversarial examples under appropriate conditions. However, SMNNs present some bottlenecks for their possible application in high-dimensional datasets. First, SMNNs have precomputed fixed weight and no SMNN training process has been defined so far, so they lack generalization ability. Second, SMNNs require the construction of a convex polytope surrounding the input dataset. In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing an SMNN training procedure based on a support subset of the given dataset and replacing the construction of the convex polytope by a method based on projections to a hypersphere. In addition, the explainability capacity of SMNNs and an effective implementation are also newly introduced in this paper.</description>
