      <title>Searching for Transit Timing Variations in young transiting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of young (&lt;800 Myr) transiting planets has provided a new avenue to explore how planets form and evolve over their lifetimes. Mass measurements for these planets would be invaluable, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by stellar activity. Transit timing variations (TTVs) offer an alternative route to measure masses that are less impacted by signals from the host star. Here we search for candidate TTVs in a sample of 39 young systems hosting 53 transiting planets using data from Kepler, K2, and TESS. We recover previously reported TTVs for 11 planets, including those in V1298 Tau, TOI-2076, Kepler-51, and TOI-1227, and identify new candidate TTVs for four planets (DS Tuc Ab, HD 63433b, K2-101b, and Kepler-1643b). In total, 28.3 +/- 6.2% of young planets in our sample show evidence of TTVs, which is higher than the rate from Kepler on mostly older systems (7.3 +/- 0.6%). Accounting for differences in data coverage and quality between Kepler and TESS only increases this difference (&gt; 4$\sigma$), although differences in methodology make a totally fair comparison challenging. We show that spots have a weak-to-negligible impact on our results, and similarly cannot explain the higher TTV fraction. Longer-term monitoring will be required to validate these TTVs as planetary in nature and confirm the high TTV rate. While the candidate TTV signals detected here are sparsely sampled, our work provides a clear priority list for additional ground-based observations, and for multi-planet TTVs, attempt to measure the masses and eccentricities of these planets.</description>

      <title>An Ancient Brown Dwarf Transiting a Metal-Poor Thick Disk Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of TOI-7019b, the first transiting brown dwarf (BD) known to orbit a star that is part of the Milky Way's ancient thick disk, as defined chemically ([Fe/H] $= -0.79 \pm 0.05$ dex, [$\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.26 \pm 0.05$ dex, [M/H] $= -0.59 \pm 0.06$ dex) and kinematically ($v_{\perp} \approx 150 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$). We estimate a system age $\tau = 12 \pm 2$ Gyr by fitting the host star's spectrum and spectral energy distribution to alpha-enhanced isochrones, and independently using the age-metallicity relation of the thick disk. This makes TOI-7019 by far the most metal-poor and ancient BD host known to date. We measure a BD mass of $61.3 \pm 2.1$ $M_{\rm J}$ and radius of $0.82 \pm 0.02$ $R_{\rm J}$ from a joint analysis of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements, along with an orbital period of $48.2592 \pm 0.0001$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.403 \pm 0.002$. The measured radius appears $12.3\% \pm 2.8\%$ larger than predicted relative to standard evolutionary models for old, metal-poor brown dwarfs, hinting at missing physics like the magnetic inhibition of convection. TOI-7019b lowers the probed metallicity regime for transiting BDs by over a factor of two, making it a benchmark system to test evolutionary models in the low-metallicity regime. Future measurements of TOI-7019b's atmosphere will test whether a brown dwarf's atmospheric composition tracks its host star's abundances, as expected for binary-like co-formation.</description>

      <title>Formation of cold giant planets around late M dwarfs via core accretion and the fate of inner rocky worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the formation of cold giant planets around M dwarfs is difficult because their disks may not contain enough solids to form massive cores and because forming giants are expected to migrate inward through disk interactions. It is also unclear whether inner rocky planets can survive in systems hosting a cold giant, with implications for the habitability of close-in worlds. We investigated the conditions that allow giant planets to form at 1-3 au around a 0.1 M$_\odot$ star and explored when a close-in rocky planet can survive. We perform N-body simulations in which embryos grow through pebble and gas accretion in a disk with a local turbulent viscosity of $\alpha_t = 10^{-4}$. Planet-disk interactions are included using a prescription that triggers outward migration when the planet-to-star mass ratio ($q$) exceeds 0.002. We find that a cold giant can form even in a disk with an initial pebble mass of 6 M$_\oplus$ if the disk gas mass is 10$\%$ of the stellar mass. This requires a compact 20 au disk with a dense inner region set by $\alpha_g = 10^{-4}$, the assembly of a $\sim$5 M$_\oplus$ core within 1 Myr, and a disk lifetime of 10 Myr. A close-in rocky planet can survive if it reaches the inner cavity before the outer body becomes a giant. Thus, giant planet formation around very low-mass stars does not require high dust masses as previously thought. A combination of planet-planet collisions, efficient pebble accretion, and a long disk lifetime plays a key role in enabling the formation of cold giant planets with masses between those of Saturn and Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Exploring Exoplanet Dynamics with JWST: Tides, Rotation, Rings, and Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although nearly 6,000 exoplanets are currently known, in most cases our knowledge is limited to a handful of the planet's orbital characteristics and bulk properties such as radius and mass. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can expand our knowledge not only by probing exoplanet atmospheres, but also by measuring additional orbital and physical properties of exoplanets, thanks to its superior light-gathering power and measurement precision. Here, we describe the potential of JWST to unveil dynamical phenomena that were previously beyond our reach, such as tidal distortion and inflation, rotational flattening, planetary rings, and moons.</description>

      <title>ExoNAMD: Leveraging the spin-orbit angle to constrain the dynamics of multiplanetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplanetary systems are excellent laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of exoplanets inside the same stellar environment. The number of known multiplanetary systems is expected to skyrocket with the advent of PLATO and the Roman space telescope. The spin-orbit angle is a key context information for the systems' dynamical history, and in recent years a growing number of planets had their spin-orbit angle measured, revealing a large diversity in orbital configurations, from well-aligned to polar, and even retrograde, orbits. Still, observers lack a robust tool to compare the dynamical state of different systems and to select the most suitable ones for future avenues of exploration, such as investigating the evolutionary pathways and their links to the atmospheric composition. Here, we present ExoNAMD, an open source code aimed at evaluating the dynamical state of multiplanetary systems via the Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit (NAMD) metric. The NAMD measures the deficit in angular momentum with respect to circular, co-planar orbits. It is normalized to compare systems with different architectures and provides a lower limit on the past dynamical excitation of the system. We find that using the spin-orbit angle parameter in the NAMD calculation (A-NAMD) improves the dynamical state's description, compared to using only the relative inclinations (R-NAMD). Comparison of A-NAMD and R-NAMD also yields powerful insights into the interplay between eccentricity and spin-orbit angle. ExoNAMD is a timely tool for easy and fast comparison of the myriad of exoplanetary systems to be discovered by PLATO and Roman, and to optimize the target selection and scientific output for future atmospheric characterization using ELTs, JWST, and Ariel.</description>

      <title>Modelling dust coagulation, dynamical drag and turbulent mixing during star and disc formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation in the discs around young stars involves the coagulation of sub-micron sized dust grains into much larger grains that may be mixed by turbulence and migrate through the disc. In this paper, we describe how we have combined a method for modelling the coagulation of a population of dust grains with the MULTIGRAIN algorithm for modelling the dynamical evolution of a population of dust grains that are subject to strong gas drag. We solve the dynamical evolution of the dust grains due to gas drag using a recently-developed implicit integration method, and we introduce a new implicit method to model the diffusion of the dust due to unresolved hydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code allows us, for the first time, to model the growth, mixing and migration of dust grain populations during the early stages of star formation and the formation, growth and evolution of a young protoplanetary disc using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In doing so, we find that including turbulent dust diffusion within the disc provides a substantial enhancement of the rate of dust grain growth due to the fact that the turbulent diffusion provides a source of small and intermediate dust grains to the regions in which the largest dust grains are growing.</description>

      <title>Water vapor emission at the warm cavity wall of the HD 100546 disk as revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</description>

      <title>Deciphering transmission spectra by exploring the solar paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy probes exoplanet atmospheres via the wavelength dependence of transit depths, but stellar contamination from magnetic activity can significantly bias these measurements. Activity-induced changes in the chromatic apparent stellar radius represent a major challenge for atmospheric characterisation. As surface distributions of magnetic features are generally unknown for stars other than the Sun, we adopt the Sun as a benchmark to study how the chromatic effect depends on the distribution of spots and faculae. Using spot and facular masks derived from SDO/HMI magnetograms and intensitygrams, combined with the SATIRE model, we compute the chromatic dependence of the Sun's apparent radius. We test different methods of convolving surface coverage with spectra the identify physical drivers of the effect. We find that simplified approaches, which neglect the CLV, underestimate the apparent radius, particularly for faculae, whose surface coverage dominates at near-solar activity levels. Proper treatment of facular CLV is therefore essential. The activity-induced variation between solar minimum and maximum reaches around 40 ppm for a Jupiter-like transit, exceeding JWST's expected 10 ppm noise floor, while remaining at around 0.4 ppm for an Earth-like transit.</description>

      <title>Venus as an exoplanet analog: extended UV transit signatures and coronal occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar activity manifests differently across wavelengths, causing flux variability that can obscure planetary transits. While transit observations are typically performed in the visible and infrared bands, where stellar flux is relatively stable, short-wavelength regimes exhibit high variability, complicating reliable detections. Here, we analyze the 2012 transit of Venus as an exoplanet analog using multiwavelength observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in five channels: 6173~\AA\ (continuum), 1700~\AA\ (broadband), and three extreme-UV (EUV) narrowbands at 304~\AA, 171~\AA, and 94~\AA. We find that the disk-integrated transit signal is clearly detectable in the 6173~\AA\ band, whereas strong solar activity-induced fluctuations obscure the transit in the EUV channels. Notably, the 1700~\AA\ UV transit is noisier but significantly longer ($\approx 9.2$~hrs) than the visible-band transit ($\approx 6.7$~hrs), because Venus began occulting the extended coronal features before ingress onto the visible disk. This observation highlights the potential of UV transits to probe the spatial extent of stellar coronae in exoplanetary systems. Numerical simulations further suggest that limb-brightened stars in quiescence phase may exhibit distinctive UV/EUV transit signatures, opening new possibilities for exoplanet detection and characterization in these spectral regimes.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets synchronization: Learning from Venus' retrograde rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Planets in the HZ can have dense atmospheres affecting their rotations. Over time, the rotation tends to stationary solutions that can be synchronous or asynchronous. Aims: Our understanding of Venus's rotational dynamics is revisited to look at what might happen to exoplanets in the habitable zone of a solar-type star. Methods. The creep tide theory is used to calculate the gravitational tidal torque. Mathematical analysis is used to study the differential equation resulting from the joint contributions of tidal and atmospheric torques. Results. The formation of a dense atmosphere can alter the primordial rotation of the planet. One possibility is that it gradually becomes retrograde. The rotation of Venus is an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2022 EB5, 2023 CX1 and 2024 BX1: these are the three recent imminent impactor discoveries from the Piszk\'estet\H{o} Mountain Station of the Konkoly Observatory. They make up about one percent of all NEO discoveries from our observatory and here we provide a detailed description of our approach and methodology that led to this noticeable observational sensitivity to these meter-sized impactors. After outlining the historical background of astronomical discoveries from Hungary, we introduce our recently upgraded survey instrumentation and outline the observational strategy and its implementation. We highlight the importance of strong feedback between analysis and ongoing data collection, maximizing the value of immediate follow-up. Finally, we discuss plans for moving forward to increase the sensitivity and the temporal coverage of our survey.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Parallelized, GPU-Accelerated Photochemical Model, XODIAC, with Built-in Equilibrium Chemistry and Multiple Chemical Networks for Exoplanetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has delivered high-quality atmospheric observations and expanded the known chemical inventory of exoplanetary atmospheres, opening new avenues for atmospheric chemistry modeling to interpret these data. Here, we present XODIAC, a fast, GPU-accelerated, one-dimensional photochemical model with a built-in equilibrium chemistry solver, an updated thermochemical database, and three chemical reaction networks. This framework enables comparative atmospheric chemistry studies, including the newly developed XODIAC-2025 network, a state-of-the-art C-H-O-N-P-S-Metals network, linking 594 species through 7,720 reactions. The other two are existing, publicly available C-H-O-N-S and C-H-O-N-S-Metals networks, from the established photochemical models VULCAN and ARGO, respectively, which are commonly used in the community. The XODIAC model has been rigorously benchmarked on the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, with results compared against these two models. Benchmarking shows excellent agreement and demonstrates that, when the same chemical network and initial conditions are used, the numerical scheme for solving atmospheric chemistry does not significantly affect the results. We also revisited the atmospheric chemistry of HD 189733 b and performed a comparative analysis across the three networks. Sulfur chemistry shows the least variation across networks, carbon chemistry shows slightly more, and phosphorus chemistry varies the most, primarily due to the introduction of unique PHO and PN pathways comprising 390 reactions in the XODIAC-2025 network. These findings highlight XODIAC's capability to advance exoplanetary atmospheric chemistry and provide a robust framework for comparative exoplanetology.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the atmosphere of HAT-P-70b with CARMENES high-resolution transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention. Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of HAT-P-70b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\rm Age&lt;1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})/P_{\rm Age\geq1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.</description>

      <title>Multicolour Validation of Two Temperate Mini-Neptunes Around M-dwarf Habitable Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For small planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their host stars, multicolour validation via photometric transit observations offers an efficient alternative to prioritize targets before intensive radial-velocity follow-up, thereby expanding the sample of habitable-zone exoplanets amenable for atmospheric characterisation. In this study, we validate two exceptional habitable-zone TESS candidates, orbiting around M-dwarfs, as genuine planets, precisely determining their transit and physical parameters. We perform Bayesian model comparison by jointly fitting multicolour light curves from TESS and ground-based follow-up, including observations with HiPERCAM at the 10.4-m GTC. Our approach uses wavelength-dependent transit depth variations and precise transit geometry to reject false positives. We validate TOI-2094 b and TOI-7166 b as two new benchmark temperate mini-Neptunes. TOI-2094 b (1.90 $R_{\oplus}$) orbits its M3V star with a period of $\sim$18.79 days, well within the habitable zone ($\sim$0.98 Earth insolation). TOI-7166 b (2.39 $R_{\oplus}$) orbits its M4.5V host star with a period of $\sim$12.92 days, placing it near the inner edge of the habitable zone ($\sim$1.93 Earth insolation). Statistical mass and density estimates suggest that TOI-2094 b may be a volatile-rich planet, such as a water world or a gaseous planet, and is less likely to be rocky, while TOI-7166 b is likely to be volatile-rich. Both planets are of great interest for detailed atmospheric characterisation with the JWST and future ELTs, which requires further precise mass measurements.</description>

      <title>TOI-7166 b: A Habitable Zone mini-Neptune planet around a nearby low-mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and validation of TOI-7166b, a 2.01+/-0.05R_Earth planet orbiting a nearby low-mass star. We validated the planet by combining TESS and multi-color high-precision photometric observations from ground-based telescopes, together with spectroscopic data, high-contrast imaging, archival images, and statistical arguments. The host star is an M4-type dwarf at a distance of ~35 pc from the Sun. It has a mass and a radius of Ms=0.190+/-0.004M_Sun and Rs=0.222+/-0.005R_Sun, respectively. TOI-7166b has an orbital period of 12.9 days, which places it close to the inner edge of the Habitable Zone of its host star, receiving an insolation flux of Sp=1.07+/-0.08S_Earth and an equilibrium temperature of Teq=249+/-5K (assuming a null Bond albedo). The brightness of the host star makes TOI-7166 a suitable target for radial velocity follow-up to measure the planetary mass and bulk density. Moreover, the physical parameters of the system including the infrared brightness (Kmag = 10.6) of the star and the planet-to-star radius ratio (0.0823+/-0.0012) make TOI-7166b an exquisite target for transmission spectroscopic observations with the JWST, to constrain the exoplanet atmospheric compositions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Planetary Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters(UPiC)-II: Catalog of planets/candidates in Open Clusters and Moving Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting planets in open clusters offers a unique opportunity to test planet formation theories in clustered environments. The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Pre-Perihelion Mapping of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ in Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 01- to 15-Aug-2025 UT, the SPHEREx spacecraft observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Using $R = 40$-$130$ spectrophotometry at $\lambda = 0.7$-$5\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of 3I were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7$-$2.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ and CO$_2$ gas at $4.23$-$4.27\,\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}$CO$_2$ and CO gas were found. A slightly extended H$_2$O coma was detected, and a huge CO$_2$ atmosphere extending out to at least $4.2\times10^{5}\,$km was discovered. Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\times10^{26} \pm 20\%$, $1.6\times10^{27} \pm 10\%$, $1.3\times10^{25} \pm 25\%$, and $1.0\times10^{26} \pm 25\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\lambda = 1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m scattered light continuum images produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\lesssim 15\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of 3I at $1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m is consistent with a $&lt; 2.5\,$km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5$-$4.0\,\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM.</description>

      <title>Systematic determination of dust properties for a sample of 133 spatially resolved debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determination of the composition and size distribution of dust grains in debris discs is strongly dependent on constraining the underlying spatial distribution of that dust through multi-wavelength, spatially resolved imaging spanning near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs. Finally, we identify samples of debris discs suitable for further characterisation at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, expanding the number of spatially resolved systems upon which future studies of these statistics can be based.</description>

      <title>Determining the Detectability of H2O with Photometric Observations using Bayesian Analysis for Remote Biosignature Identification on exoEarths (BARBIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the detectability of water (H2O) in the reflected-light spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet assuming a photometric observational approach rather than spectroscopic. By quantifying the detectability as a function of normalized exposure time, resolving power (R), and amount of spectral points, we can constrain whether spectroscopy or photometry is the more efficient observing procedure to detect H2O at varying abundances by measuring the broad 0.94 microns absorption feature using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We simulate low-resolution spectroscopy (R = 10, 20, 30, presented as photometric bandwidth fraction 10%, 5%, 3% herein) as a proxy for narrow-band photometric observations, and constrain the wavelength range from 0.85 - 1.05 microns, to narrow focus on the 0.9 microns feature. We then constrain the number of spectral points to 2 or 3 points at each bandwidth fraction to investigate the impact of spectral point placement on detectability. Additionally, we take the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for strong H2O detection and calculate the resultant exoplanet yields assuming photometric observation and compare to the yields from higher-resolution spectroscopic observations under different noise instances, characterization wavelength, noise floors, and aperture sizes. We find that H2O is strongly detectable at all bandwidth fractions depending on the spectral point placement, requiring a minimum of 3 spectral points, at a variety of normalized exposure time depending on the abundance of H2O. We also find that the detector noise is the main driver in determining whether photometry or spectroscopy results in higher yields. Photometry is the preferred observational method in high-noise cases, while spectroscopy is preferred in low-noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>JWST TRAPPIST-1 e/b Program: Motivation and first observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the forefront goals in the field of exoplanets is the detection of an atmosphere on a temperate terrestrial exoplanet, and among the best suited systems to do so is TRAPPIST-1. However, JWST transit observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets show significant contamination from stellar surface features that we are unable to confidently model. Here, we present the motivation and first observations of our JWST multi-cycle program of TRAPPIST-1 e, which utilize close transits of the airless TRAPPIST-1 b to model-independently correct for stellar contamination, with the goal of determining whether TRAPPIST-1 e has an Earth-like mean molecular weight atmosphere containing CO$_2$. We present our simulations, which show that with the 15 close transit observations, we will be able to detect this atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e at $\Delta\ln\,Z=5$ or greater confidence assuming we are able to correct for stellar contamination using the close transit observations. We also show the first three observations of our program. We find that our ability to correct for stellar contamination can be inhibited when strong stellar flares are present, as flares can break the assumption that the star does not change meaningfully between planetary transits. The cleanest observation demonstrates the removal of stellar contamination contribution through an increased preference for a flat line over the original TRAPPIST-1 e spectrum, but highlights how minor data analysis assumptions can propagate significantly when searching for small atmospheric signals. This is amplified when using the signals from multiple planets, which is important to consider as we continue our atmospheric search.</description>

      <title>A 43 day transiting Neptune and two 25 day Saturns from TESS, NGTS and ASTEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond orbital periods of 10 days, there is a dearth of known transiting gas giants. On longer orbits, planets are less affected by their host star, and become ideal probes of planet formation, migration and evolution. We report the discovery of a long period Neptune and two Saturns, each initially identified as single transits in the TESS photometry, and solved through additional transits from ground-based follow-up photometric observations by NGTS and ASTEP. High-resolution radial velocity mass measurements using CORALIE and HARPS confirm their planetary nature. From joint modelling of the photometric and spectroscopic data, we determine an orbital period of $43.12655_{-0.00017}^{+0.00012}~$days, radius of $3.65\pm0.22~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, and mass of $19.1_{-4.5}^{+4.9}~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ for NGTS-34b, making it one of the longest period well-characterized transiting Neptunes. Orbiting a late F-type star, bright in the K-band (Kmag$~\simeq7.9$), it is amenable for cool atmosphere studies using JWST or Ariel. TOI-4940b is a small Saturn on a $25.867811_{-0.000056}^{+0.000058}~$day orbit with a radius of $6.61\pm0.37~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and an upper mass limit $&lt;89~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$. NGTS-35b(=TOI-6669b) is a larger Saturn on a $25.241192\pm0.000022~$day, moderately eccentric orbit ($e = 0.192_{-0.033}^{+0.037}$), with a radius of $10.90\pm0.65~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and a mass of $152_{-19}^{+22}~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$. With an assumed albedo $A=0.3$, each of these planets has an equilibrium temperature below 700K, with NGTS-35b especially cold at $450~$K. These three giants add to the small but growing population of long period planets that can further our understanding of planet formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Test of Substellar Evolutionary Models with High-Precision Ages from Asteroseismology and Gyrochronology for the Benchmark System HR 7672AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision measurements for HR 7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L dwarf companion. Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR 7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\pm0.65$ Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$ $M_\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. Finally, we detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</description>

      <title>yieldplotlib: A unified library for exoplanet yield code visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's next flagship observatory, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), aims to detect and charaterize ~25 habitable zone planets. The total number of habitable zone planets detected is referred to as the exo-Earth "yield'' and accurate yield estimates will be critically important to the mission's success. Tools like the Altruistic Yield Optimizer (AYO) and EXOSIMS provide these yield estimates but differ in language, methods, and outputs. yieldplotlib provides a unified library that can visualize the inputs and outputs of these yield codes in a complete, descriptive, and accessible way.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of circumstellar disk lifetimes: Disk evolution in a single star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining how long circumstellar disks last is key to understanding the timescale of planet formation. Typically, this is done by measuring the fraction of young stars with infrared-excess, a sign of circumstellar material, in stellar clusters of different ages. However, comparing data from different star-forming regions at different distances introduces uncertainties and biases because of the different sample completeness and environment. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\odot$. By using $\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines.</description>

      <title>Shock trapping and inertial escape: Dust-particle clustering in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Escaping Cosmic Rays and Interstellar Medium: Driving of Galactic Winds and Shaping the Local Proton Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of escaping cosmic rays (CRs) on the interstellar medium (ISM) around their source with spherically symmetric CR-hydrodynamical simulations taking into account the evolution of the CR energy spectrum, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I.</description>

      <title>Detecting False Positives With Derived Planetary Parameters: Experimenting with the KEPLER Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas. Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous detection of the size and velocity of the largest ejecta particles with velocities exceeding 1 km s$^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impact ejecta with velocities exceeding the escape velocity of planetary bodies become meteorites and dust particles in interplanetary space. We present a new method that allows simultaneous measurement of the size and velocity of the largest high-velocity ejecta. High-speed camera images revealed the time required for the ejecta to reach the secondary target, and ejecta size was determined after the experiment by analyzing the craters formed upon their impact on the secondary target. We defined the size-velocity relationships of sub-millimeter ejecta with velocities exceeding 1 km s$^{-1}$, focusing on the largest detectable ejecta in our experiments. The results show that millimeter-sized meteoroids impacting the rocky surfaces of planetary bodies at 7 km s$^{-1}$ eject particles up to a few tens of micrometers in size toward interplanetary space at velocities exceeding the escape velocity of the body, even when it is greater than 1 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for technosignatures--remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology--draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of 10 self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy, beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to eight of the 10 scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrowband directed transmissions, as occur in two of the scenarios. Further study involving direct detections at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combinations of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts, such as a solar-gravitational-lens mission, could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that would otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary flyby or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of a Superjovian Planet 3--4 lambda/D from the Accelerating Star HIP 54515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a superjovian planet around the young A5 star HIP 54515, detected using precision astrometry from the Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS from the recently-commenced OASIS program. SCExAO/CHARIS detects HIP 54515 b in five epochs 0\farcs{}145--0\farcs{}192 from the star ($\sim$3--4 $\lambda$/D at 1.65 $\mu m$), exhibiting clockwise orbital motion. HIP 54515 b lies near the M/L transition with a luminosity of log(L/L$_{\rm \odot}$) $\sim$ -3.52 $\pm$ 0.03.
  Dynamical modeling constrains its mass and mass ratio to be ${17.7}_{-4.9}^{+7.6}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and ${0.0090}_{-0.0024}^{+0.0036}$ and favors a $\sim$25 au semimajor axis. HIP 54515 b adds to a growing list of superjovian planets with moderate eccentricities (e $\approx$ 0.4). Now the third planet discovered from surveys combining high-contrast extreme adaptive optics imaging with precision astrometry, HIP 54515 b should help improve empirical constraints on the luminosity evolution and eccentricity distribution of the most massive planets. It may also provide a key technical test of the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument's performance in the low stellar flux, small angular separation limit and a demonstration of its ability to yield constrainable planet spectral properties.</description>

      <title>JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Cherenkov Photon Background for Low-Noise Silicon Detectors in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and single-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon band gap (~1.1 $\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic cosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov photon production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise silicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends on detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of heavy cosmic ray species (Z &gt; 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors, such as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths, the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background model to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we find that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at longer wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we find that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos of Cherenkov photons.</description>
