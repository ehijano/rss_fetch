      <title>List strong and list normal edge-coloring of (sub)cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which the edges of every path of length 3 receive distinct colors; in other words, every pair of edges at distance at most 2 must be colored differently. The least number of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong chromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that the list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10. This bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.
  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list strong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting an infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the special case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic index equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs with distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.
  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of the normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors or to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture. 
  Similarly to the strong edge-coloring, the list normal edge-coloring is much more restrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is greater than the normal chromatic index. In particular, we show that there are cubic graphs with the list normal chromatic index at least 9, there are bridgeless cubic graphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with value at least 7.</description>

      <title>On maximum graphs in Tutte polynomial posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boesch, Li, and Suffel were the first to identify the existence of uniformly optimally reliable graphs (UOR graphs), graphs which maximize all-terminal reliability over all graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The all-terminal reliability of a graph, and more generally a graph's all-terminal reliability polynomial $R(G;p)$, may both be obtained via the Tutte polynomial $T(G;x,y)$ of the graph $G$. Here we show that the UOR graphs found earlier are in fact maximum graphs for the Tutte polynomial itself, in the sense that they are maximum not just for all-terminal reliability but for a vast array of other parameters and polynomials that may be obtained from $T(G;x,y)$ as well. These parameters include, but are not limited to, enumerations of a wide variety of well-known orientations, partial orientations, and fourientations of $G$; the magnitudes of the coefficients of the chromatic and flow polynomials of $G$; and a wide variety of generating functions, such as generating functions enumerating spanning forests and spanning connected subgraphs of $G$. The maximality of all of these parameters is done in a unified way through the use of $(n,m)$ Tutte polynomial posets.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial proof of an identity involving Eulerian numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of an identity that involves Eulerian numbers and was obtained algebraically by Brenti and Welker (2009). To do so, we study alcoved triangulations of dilated hypersimplices. As a byproduct, we describe the dual graph of the triangulation in the case of the standard simplex, conjecture its structure for general hypersimplices, and prove combinatorially that the Eulerian numbers coincide with the normalized volumes of the hypersimplices.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the number of edges in DP-critical graphs. II. Four colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-critical (list $k$-critical, DP $k$-critical) if $\chi(G)= k$ ($\chi_\ell(G)= k$, $\chi_\mathrm{DP}(G)= k$) and for every proper subgraph $G'$ of $G$, $\chi(G')&lt;k$ ($\chi_\ell(G')&lt; k$, $\chi_\mathrm{DP}(G')&lt;k$). Let $f(n, k)$ ($f_\ell(n, k), f_\mathrm{DP}(n,k)$) denote the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $k$-critical (list $k$-critical, DP $k$-critical) graph. The main result of this paper is that if $n\geq 6$ and $n\not\in\{7,10\}$, then $$f_\mathrm{DP}(n,4)&gt;\left(3 + \frac{1}{5} \right) \frac{n}{2}. $$ This is the first bound on $f_\mathrm{DP}(n,4)$ that is asymptotically better than the well-known bound $f(n,4)\geq \left(3 + \frac{1}{13} \right) \frac{n}{2}$ by Gallai from 1963. The result also yields a better bound on $f_{\ell}(n,4)$ than the one known before.</description>

      <title>Uniform generation of large traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the uniform generation of infinite traces, i.e., infinite words up to commutation of some letters. The algorithm outputs on-the-fly approximations of a theoretical infinite trace, the latter being distributed according to the exact uniform probability measure. The average size of the approximation grows linearly with the time of execution of the algorithm, hence its output can be effectively used while running. Two versions of the algorithm are given. A version without rejection has a good production speed, provided that some precomputations have been done, but these may be costly. A version with rejection requires much fewer computations, at the expense of a production speed that can be small. We also show that, for some particular trace monoids, one or the other version of the algorithm can actually be very good: few computations for a good production speed.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of graphs of Hyperbinary Expansions and Efficient Algorithms for Stern's Diatomic Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate hyperbinary expansions of a nonnegative integer $n$, an edge-labelled directed graph $A(n)$ has recently been introduced. After pointing out some new simple facts about its cyclomatic number, we give a relatively simple description of its structure and prove that if $m,n$ are even numbers for which $A(n)$ and $A(m)$ are isomorphic as edge-labelled graphs, then $m=n$. From the structure of $A(n)$ we also derive a formula and an efficient algorithm for the Stern's diatomic sequence.</description>

      <title>Disproofs of four Gallai-Ramsey-type conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a significant variation of Ramsey numbers, the Gallai-Ramsey number $GR_k(H)$ refers to the smallest positive integer $r$ such that, by coloring the edges of $K_r$ with at most $k$ colors, there exists either a monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to $H$ or a rainbow triangle. Mao, Wang, Magnant, and Schiermeyer [Discrete Math., 2023], Song, Wei, Zhang, and Zhao [Discrete Math., 2020], and Zhao and Wei [Discrete Appl. Math., 2021] each proposed one conjecture on the Gallai-Ramsey numbers for fans, wheels, and kipases, respectively. We establish new lower bounds that disprove all three conjectures. Su and Liu [Graphs Combin., 2022] studied the Gallai-Ramsey-full property of graphs and conjectured that a graph is Ramsey-full if and only if it is Gallai-Ramsey-full. We present two classes of graphs that are Ramsey-full, but neither is Gallai-Ramsey-full.</description>

      <title>Large Cuts in Hypergraphs via Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple probabilistic argument shows that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges contains an $r$-partite subhypergraph with at least $\frac{r!}{r^r}m$ edges. The celebrated result of Edwards states that in the case of graphs, that is $r=2$, the resulting bound $m/2$ can be improved to $m/2+\Omega(m^{1/2})$, and this is sharp. We prove that if $r\geq 3$, then there is an $r$-partite subhypergraph with at least $\frac{r!}{r^r} m+m^{3/5-o(1)}$ edges. Moreover, if the hypergraph is linear, this can be improved to $\frac{r!}{r^r} m+m^{3/4-o(1)},$ which is tight up to the $o(1)$ term. These improve results of Conlon, Fox, Kwan, and Sudakov. Our proof is based on a combination of probabilistic, combinatorial, and linear algebraic techniques, and semidefinite programming.
  A key part of our argument is relating the energy $\mathcal{E}(G)$ of a graph $G$ (i.e. the sum of absolute values of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix) to its maximum cut. We prove that every $m$ edge multigraph $G$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+\Omega(\frac{\mathcal{E}(G)}{\log m})$, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Ehrhart $h^*$-polynomial of positroid polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A positroid is a matroid realized by a matrix such that all maximal minors are non-negative. Positroid polytopes are matroid polytopes of positroids. In particular, they are lattice polytopes. The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope counts the number of integer points in the dilation of that polytope. The Ehrhart series is the generating function of the Ehrhart polynomial, which is a rational function with numerator called the $h^*$-polynomial. We compute the $h^*$-polynomial of positroid polytopes in two ways. The first method produces coefficients that are given by cover relations in a poset. The second method gives a positive formula and a fast algorithm based on breadth first search. Our result generalizes that of Early, Kim, and Li for hypersimplices.</description>

      <title>Efficient $1$-bit tensor approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially efficient decomposition of matrices and arbitrary-order tensors as linear combinations of tensor products of $\{-1, 1\}$-valued vectors. For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $$A - R_w = S_w C_w T_w^\top = \sum_{j=1}^w c_j \cdot \mathbf{s}_j \mathbf{t}_j^\top$$ is a {\it $w$-width signed cut decomposition of $A$}. Here $C_w = "diag"(\mathbf{c}_w)$ for some $\mathbf{c}_w \in \mathbb{R}^w,$ and $S_w, T_w$, and the vectors $\mathbf{s}_j, \mathbf{t}_j$ are $\{-1, 1\}$-valued. To store $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$, we may pack $w \cdot (m + n)$ bits, and require only $w$ floating point numbers. As a function of $w$, $\|R_w\|_F$ exhibits exponential decay when applied to #f32 matrices with i.i.d. $\mathcal N (0, 1)$ entries. Choosing $w$ so that $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$ has the same memory footprint as a \textit{f16} or \textit{bf16} matrix, the relative error is comparable. Our algorithm yields efficient signed cut decompositions in $20$ lines of pseudocode. It reflects a simple modification from a celebrated 1999 paper [1] of Frieze and Kannan. As a first application, we approximate the weight matrices in the open \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} Large Language Model to a $50\%$ spatial compression. Remarkably, all $226$ remainder matrices have a relative error $&lt;6\%$ and the expanded model closely matches \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} on the {\it huggingface} leaderboard [2]. Benchmark performance degrades slowly as we reduce the spatial compression from $50\%$ to $25\%$. We optimize our open source \textit{rust} implementation [3] with \textit{simd} instructions on \textit{avx2} and \textit{avx512} architectures. We also extend our algorithm from matrices to tensors of arbitrary order and use it to compress a picture of the first author's cat Angus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further explore the notion of Ulam words considered by Bade, Cui, Labelle, and Li. We find that when interpreted as integers in a natural way, Ulam words appear to follow a new, unexplained distribution. Gaps between words and words of special type also reveal remarkable structure. By substantially increasing the number of computed terms, we are also able to sharpen some of the conjectures made by Bade et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier publication, the last two authors showed that a finite-dimensional module for a quantum affine algebra of type $A$ whose $q$-factorization graph is totally ordered is prime. In this paper, we continue the investigation of the role of totally ordered pseudo $q$-factorization graphs in the study of the monoidal structure of the underlying abelian category. We introduce the notions of modules with (prime) snake support and of maximal totally ordered subgraphs decompositions. Our main result shows that modules with snake support have unique such decomposition and that it determines the corresponding prime factorization. Along the way, we also prove that prime snake modules (for type $A$) can be characterized as the modules for which every pseudo $q$-factorization graph is totally ordered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we aim to classify monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay. We especially focus our attention on edge ideals. The Cohen-Macaulayness of the last matching power of an edge ideal is characterized, providing an algebraic analogue of the famous Tutte theorem regarding graphs having a perfect matching. For chordal graphs, very well-covered graphs and Cameron-Walker graphs, we completely solve our problem.</description>

      <title>The local weak limit of $k$-dimensional hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$ be the set of $k$-dimensional simplicial complexes $C$ over a fixed set of $n$ vertices such that:
  (1) $C$ has a complete $k-1$-skeleton;
  (2) $C$ has precisely ${{n-1}\choose {k}}$ $k$-faces;
  (3) the homology group $H_{k-1}(C)$ is finite.
  Consider the probability measure on $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$ where the probability of a simplicial complex $C$ is proportional to $|H_{k-1}(C)|^2$. For any fixed $k$, we determine the local weak limit of these random simplicial complexes as $n$ tends to infinity.
  This local weak limit turns out to be the same as the local weak limit of the $1$-out $k$-complexes investigated by Linial and Peled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary functions are a generalisation of the cocircuit spaces of binary matroids to arbitrary functions. Every rank function is assigned a binary function, and the deletion and contraction operations of binary functions generalise matroid deletion and contraction. We give the excluded minor characterisations for the classes of binary functions with well defined minors, and those with an associated rank function. Within these classes, we also characterise the classes of binary functions corresponding to polymatroids, matroids and binary matroids by their excluded minors. This gives a new proof of Tutte's excluded minor characterisation of binary matroids in the more generalised space of binary functions.</description>

      <title>On Generalizations of Pairwise Compatibility Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08503v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an edge-weighted tree and an interval $I$, such that each leaf of the tree is a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge $\{ x, y \}$ in $G$ if and only if the weight of the path in the tree connecting $x$ and $y$ lies within the interval $I$. Originating in phylogenetics, PCGs are closely connected to important graph classes like leaf-powers and multi-threshold graphs, widely applied in bioinformatics, especially in understanding evolutionary processes. In this paper we introduce two natural generalizations of the PCG class, namely $k$-OR-PCG and $k$-AND-PCG, which are the classes of graphs that can be expressed as union and intersection, respectively, of $k$ PCGs. These classes can be also described using the concepts of the covering number and the intersection dimension of a graph in relation to the PCG class. We investigate how the classes of OR-PCG and AND-PCG are related to PCGs, $k$-interval-PCGs and other graph classes known in the literature. In particular, we provide upper bounds on the minimum $k$ for which an arbitrary graph $G$ belongs to $k$-interval-PCGs, $k$-OR-PCG or $k$-AND-PCG classes. For particular graph classes we improve these general bounds. Moreover, we show that, for every integer $k$, there exists a bipartite graph that is not in the $k$-interval-PCGs class, proving that there is no finite $k$ for which the $k$-interval-PCG class contains all the graphs. This answers an open question of Ahmed and Rahman from 2017. Finally, using a Ramsey theory argument, we show that for any $k$, there exists graphs that are not in $k$-AND-PCG, and graphs that are not in $k$-OR-PCG.</description>

      <title>Structure and algorithms for graphs excluding grids with small parity breaks as odd-minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a structural generalisation of treewidth we call $\mathcal{A}$-blind-treewidth where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes an annotated graph class. This width parameter is defined by evaluating only the size of those bags $B$ of tree-decompositions for a graph $G$ where ${(G,B) \notin \mathcal{A}}$. For the two cases where $\mathcal{A}$ is (i) the class $\mathcal{B}$ of all pairs ${(G,X)}$ such that no odd cycle in $G$ contains more than one vertex of ${X \subseteq V(G)}$ and (ii) the class $\mathcal{B}$ together with the class $\mathcal{P}$ of all pairs ${(G,X)}$ such that the "torso" of $X$ in $G$ is planar. For both classes, $\mathcal{B}$ and ${\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{P}}$, we obtain analogues of the Grid Theorem by Robertson and Seymour and FPT-algorithms that either compute decompositions of small width or correctly determine that the width of a given graph is large. Moreover, we present FPT-algorithms for Maximum Independent Set on graphs of bounded $\mathcal{B}$-blind-treewidth and Maximum Cut on graphs of bounded ${(\mathcal{B}\cup\mathcal{P})}$-blind-treewidth.</description>

      <title>A positional statistic for 1324-avoiding permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class $S_n(1324)$ of permutations of size $n$ that avoid the pattern 1324 and examine the subset $S_n^{a\prec n}(1324)$ of elements for which $a\prec n\prec [a-1]$, $a\ge 1$. This notation means that, when written in one line notation, such a permutation must have $a$ to the left of $n$, and the elements of $\{1,\dots,a-1\}$ must all be to the right of $n$. For $n\ge 2$, we establish a connection between the subset of permutations in $S_n^{1\prec n}(1324)$ having the 1 adjacent to the $n$ (called primitives), and the set of 1324-avoiding dominoes with $n-2$ points. For $a\in\{1,2\}$, we introduce constructive algorithms and give formulas for the enumeration of $S_n^{a\prec n}(1324)$ by the position of $a$ relative to the position of $n$. For $a\ge 3$, we formulate some conjectures for the corresponding generating functions.</description>

      <title>All cycle-chords are $e$-positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the $e$-positivity of all cycle-chord graphs by using the composition method that is developed by Zhou and the author very recently. Our method is much simpler than the $(e)$-positivity approach that is used for handling cycle-chords with girth at most $4$. We also provide a combinatorial interpretation of the $e_I$-coefficients of the chromatic symmetric functions of cycle-chords.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers and extremal structures in polar spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use $p$-rank bounds on partial ovoids and the classical bounds on Ramsey numbers to obtain upper bounds on the size of partial $m$-ovoids in finite classical polar spaces. These bounds imply non-existence of $m$-ovoids for new infinite families of polar spaces. We also give a probabilistic construction of large partial $m$-ovoids when $m$ grows linearly with the rank of the polar space.
  In the special case of the symplectic spaces over the binary field, we prove an equivalence between partial $m$-ovoids and a generalisation of Oddtown families from extremal set theory that has been studied under the name of $m$-nearly orthogonal sets. We give a new construction for large partial $2$-ovoids in these spaces and thus $2$-nearly orthogonal sets over the binary field. This construction uses triangle-free graphs associated to certain BCH codes whose complements have low $2$-rank and it gives an asymptotic improvement over the previous best construction. We give another construction of triangle-free graphs using a binary projective cap, which has low complementary rank over the reals. This improves the bounds in the recently introduced rank-Ramsey problem and it gives better constructions of large partial $m$-ovoids for $m &gt; 2$ in the binary symplectic space.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's star-product up to order 7 for affine Poisson brackets: where are the Riemann zeta values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kontsevich star-product admits a well-defined restriction to the class of affine -- in particular, linear -- Poisson brackets; its graph expansion consists only of Kontsevich's graphs with in-degree $\leqslant 1$ for aerial vertices. We obtain the formula $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with harmonic propagators for the graph weights (over $n\leqslant 7$ aerial vertices); we verify that all these weights satisfy the cyclic weight relations by Shoikhet--Felder--Willwacher, that they match the computations using the $\textsf{kontsevint}$ software by Panzer, and the resulting affine star-product is associative modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$.
  We discover that the Riemann zeta value $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$, which enters the harmonic graph weights (up to rationals), actually disappears from the analytic formula of $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ \textit{because} all the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combinations of Kontsevich graphs near $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$ represent differential consequences of the Jacobi identity for the affine Poisson bracket, hence their contribution vanishes. We thus derive a ready-to-use shorter formula $\star_{\text{aff}}^{\text{red}}$ mod~$\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with only rational coefficients.</description>

      <title>Polynomial growth in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the iid part of the transmission times we allow any nonnegative distribution with regularly varying behaviour at $0$. For the underlying graph models we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We prove that upon increasing the penalty exponent, the transmission time between two far away vertices $x,y$ sweeps through four universal phases even for a single underlying graph: explosive (tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear ($|x-y|^{\eta_0+o(1)}$ for an explicit $\eta_0&lt;1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. Further, none of these phases are restricted to phase boundaries, and those are non-trivial in the main model parameters: the tail of the degree-distribution, a long-range parameter, and the exponent of regular variation of the iid part of the transmission times. In this paper we present proofs of lower bounds for the latter two phases and the upper bound for the linear phase. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Critical Thresholds for Maximum Cardinality Matching on General Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant work has been done on computing the ``average'' optimal solution value for various $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems using the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to establish \emph{critical thresholds}. Critical thresholds define narrow bounds for the optimal solution of a problem instance such that the probability that the solution value lies outside these bounds vanishes as the instance size approaches infinity. In this paper, we extend the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to general hypergraphs on $n$ vertices and $M$ hyperedges. We consider the problem of determining critical thresholds for the largest cardinality matching, and we show that for $M=o(1.155^n)$ the size of the maximum cardinality matching is almost surely 1. On the other hand, if $M=\Theta(2^n)$ then the size of the maximum cardinality matching is $\Omega(n^{\frac12-\gamma})$ for an arbitrary $\gamma &gt;0$. Lastly, we address the gap where $\Omega(1.155^n)=M=o(2^n)$ empirically through computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Simple Random Walks With a Deck of Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When we want to simulate the realization of a symmetric simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, we use $(2d)$-side fair dice to decide to which neighbor it jumps at each step if $d\geq 2$ or we simply use a fair coin when $d=1$. Assume that instead of using a dice or a coin we want to do a simulation using a well shuffled deck with $K$ cards of each of the $2d$ suits. In the first step the probability of jumping to each neighbor is $(2d)^{-1}$, but from the second step it becomes biased. Of course if we continue performing this simulation, the total variation distance between its law and the law of the random walk will increase until all cards are used. In this paper we investigate the minimum number of cards $N=2d K$ that a deck must contain so that the total variation distance between the law of a $n$-step simulation and the law of a $n$-step realization of the random walk is smaller than a chosen threshold $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. More generally, we prove that when $N=cn$ this distance converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a Gaussian profile which depends on $c\geq 2d$. Furthermore, our analysis shows that this Gaussian profile vanishes as $c \to \infty$, proving the convergence of a multivariate hypergeometric distribution to a multinomial distribution in total variation.</description>
