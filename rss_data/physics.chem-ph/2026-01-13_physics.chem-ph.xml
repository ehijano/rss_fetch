      <title>Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of non-F\"{o}rster exciton transfer mechanisms in perylene diimide donor, phenylene bridge, and terrylene diimide acceptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of F\"{o}rster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from F\"{o}rster's spectral overlap expression.</description>

      <title>Cation Dominated but Negatively Charged Na2SO4,aq-Graphene Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Characterization of C2H4N2 Isomers: Structures, electronic energies, spectroscopic parameters and formation pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of key isomers of C2H4N2 using state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods. The objective is to characterize their molecular structures, spectroscopic constants, and electronic energies, and to elucidate plausible formation and destruction pathways, providing data critical for astrochemical and atmospheric detection. High-accuracy ab initio methods were employed, notably CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 for optimized geometries. Additional calculations were performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CIS levels. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore reaction pathways. Zero-point energy corrections were determined for all isomers considered. Six low-energy C2H4N2 isomers were identified, all within 1 eV of the global minimum. Among them, methylcyanamide (MCA) exhibits the lowest relative energy (~0.2 eV) and a significant electric dipole moment of 5.00 D, making it a strong candidate for gas-phase detection. The rotational constants for MCA, computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level, are Ae = 34932.44 MHz, Be = 4995.31 MHz, and Ce = 4520.30 MHz. The V3 torsional barrier was found to be 631.19 cm^{-1}. Centrifugal distortion constants were computed up to sextic order for all isomers. Formation pathways for MCA, such as CH3N + HCN -&gt; CH3NHCN and related isomers, were characterized. The combination of large dipole moments and distinct rotational signatures supports the detectability of methylcyanamide and related C2H4N2 isomers via radioastronomy, infrared, and microwave spectroscopy. Isomerization and reaction pathways involving radical-neutral and neutral-neutral processes were found to be key to their formation in gas-phase environments. These results provide a robust foundation for future observational and modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Electric field gradient in accurate quantum chemical calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric field gradients (EFGs) at the (non-spherical) nucleus contribute to atomic and molecular hyperfine structure and govern Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) and M\"ossbauer spectra. EFGs provide a highly sensitive probe of local bonding, symmetry, and crystal defect geometry and electronic structure. The EFGs can be obtained from electronic structure calculations and can also be extracted from spectroscopic measurements, thus linking electronic structure theory and spectroscopic observables. In this work, we present a methodological study of EFGs for a range of molecules and crystalline materials, using both periodic boundary conditions and embedded cluster models, and compare the results with reported experimental data. We analyze the sensitivity of EFG values to details of the calculations, such as the selection of the model Hamiltonians, basis sets, and the geometries of molecules and crystals. We also address persistent differences in EFG sign conventions and tensor definitions employed in the literature and in widely used quantum chemistry codes. While the EFG sign does not affect zero B-field NQR spectra, they can become critical in Mossbauer spectroscopy or when the quadrupolar interactions are combined with other interactions of the nucleus with the environment. Together, our systematic study results provide practical guidelines for computing, interpreting, and exploiting EFGs as quantitative descriptors of electronic structure and chemical environment.</description>

      <title>Full symmetry-breaking of electronic and nuclear dynamics for low attosecond timescale electronic chirality reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science is an emerging topic where chirality plays a central role. Here we demonstrate that subjecting iodoacetylene,a geometrically achiral molecule, to a pair of simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses induces the fastest reversals of the continuously-valued S and R electronic chirality assignments to date, by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds). We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting 'easy' and 'hard' directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards. Future research directions include determination of the underlying mechanism governing chiral induced spin selectivity, in addition to application to chiral spin selective phenomena in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors, partnered with orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT).</description>

      <title>A directly observable, Zeeman-insensitive nuclear spin coherence in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clock transitions are well known in atomic and solid-state systems, but are largely unexplored in molecular liquids. Here we demonstrate a clock-like, nuclear-spin avoided crossing in [1--$^{13}$C]-fumarate that supports long-lived and directly observable coherences at ultralow magnetic field: a three-spin transition $|S_0\alpha\rangle \leftrightarrow |T_{+1}\beta\rangle$ near 400 nT exhibits a shallow crossing with a frequency minimum of 2 Hz. The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.</description>

      <title>Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an explicit basis for the $\operatorname{SU}(2)$-invariant space of the exterior power $\wedge_{2k} \mathbb{C}^{2m}$ via the combinatorics of plane partitions. In quantum chemistry, this is the space of spin adapted quantum states of an electronic system with $m$ spin orbitals and $k$ electron pairs. We construct our basis by identifying the invariant space with an Artinian commutative ring called the excitation ring. We compute a Gr\"obner basis and enumerate its standard monomials via an explicit bijection to Dyck paths counted by the Narayana numbers.</description>

      <title>Creation and precise spectroscopy of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ halo molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the creation of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ molecules in the halo state and neighboring weakly bound states. Efficient molecule production via one-photon photoassociation relies on sufficient wavefunction overlap between the target vibrational states in the electronic excited- and ground-state potentials. Using Autler-Townes spectroscopy, transition strengths are measured to identify optimal pathways for production of weakly bound molecules. Vibrational splittings for the three least-bound vibrational states are measured, and dominant systematic uncertainties are evaluated with uncertainties below 100 Hz. From these splittings, absolute binding energies for these weakly bound vibrational states are determined. The results pave the way to a molecular isotope shift measurement with Sr$_2$.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate mismatch, orientation, and flexibility on heterogeneous ice nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice.</description>

      <title>Size Dependent Ternary Halide Solid Solutions in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline solid solutions incorporate guest atoms by substituting host lattice sites up to a solubility limit dictated by solute host similarity. Solid solutions enable tuning various material properties, such as the optoelectronic behavior of halide perovskites. In bulk, incompatibility of Cl:I halide mixtures restricts exploration throughout the ternary halide Cl:Br:I compositional range. However, solubility is extended in nanocrystals which better accommodate a wider range of ions within their lattice. Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility. Smaller nanocrystals, with sufficient Br content, stabilize the Cl:Br:I solid solutions, suppress planar stacking fault defects and prevent halide segregation.</description>

      <title>Case study of an exploratory high voltage NASICON-based Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ cathode material for sodium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.</description>

      <title>Janus Polymeric Giant Vesicles on Demand: A Predictive Phase Separation Approach for Efficient Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Janus particles, with their intrinsic asymmetry, are attracting major interest in various applications, including emulsion stabilization, micro/nanomotors, imaging, and drug delivery. In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers.</description>

      <title>Functionalization of Benzene Ices by Atomic Oxygen</title>

Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of constrained Schr\"odinger dynamics with application to time-dependent density-functional theory on a finite lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\"odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\"odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new formulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) based on the geometric structure of the set of states constrained to have a fixed density. Orbital-free TDDFT is formulated using a hydrodynamics equation involving a new universal density-to-current functional map. In the corresponding Kohn--Sham equation, the density is reproduced using a non-local operator. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional soft-Coulomb systems are provided.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>

      <title>The Photochemical Birth of the Hydrated Electron in Liquid Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrix and tensor approximations for compression of machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is mainly verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50 % compression without any loss of MTP accuracy. We also demonstrate that the developed methodology is universal and can be applied to compress other MLIPs on the example of Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE).</description>

      <title>The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress, or pressure, is a central quantity in engineering and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is invalid for an inhomogeneous fluid, which is essential in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area, yet is derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress1 to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing the incorporation of quantum mechanical (QM) physics into classical simulation. We present the derivation of this local stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving and Kirkwood 2 . For the test case of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show that the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate that this planar definition of stress is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP, is provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Foundation Neural Network Models using Multiple Time-Step and Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. DMTS uses a dual-level neural network where the target accurate potential is coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process. The 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast-varying forces, i.e., mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: nearly 4-fold in homogeneous systems and 3-fold in large solvated proteins through leveraging active learning for enhanced stability. Such a strategy is applicable to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with classical force fields.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge transfer driven complex reaction dynamics: covalent bonding meets van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast charge transfer (CT) processes redistribute electronic charge within and between molecular units and play a central role in many physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. However, the microscopic pathways of multiple CT events, including the coupled structural evolution and energy redistribution, are challenging to disentangle experimentally in complex systems. To obtain controlled insight into such dynamics, well-defined properties are required. Here, we investigate the N2Ar dimer, which combines a covalent bond with a weak van der Waals interaction, using site-selective synchrotron photoionization and coincident detection of electrons and ions. Combined with ab initio calculations, this approach enables step-by-step tracking of ultrafast CT and fragmentation dynamics. We find that the dimer's structural evolution triggers a second CT event, opening complex reaction pathways in which electrons are transferred back and forth between Ar and N2, through two nonadiabatic transitions involving conical intersections. These results demonstrate that sequential multiple CT-induced transitions, even in a simple dimer, provide controlled insight into nonadiabatic reaction mechanisms relevant to complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $\omega-2\omega$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</description>

      <title>Beyond asymptotic reasoning: the practicalities of a quantum ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approaches. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>
