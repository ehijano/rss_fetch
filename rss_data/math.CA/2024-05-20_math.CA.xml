      <title>First Order Linear Proportional Difference Equation with Integration Factor the $(s,t)$-Pantograph Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find solutions to first-order linear proportional difference equations via the $(s,t)$-integration factor method. The $(s,t)$-integration factor involves the $(s,t)$-Pantograph function, which is a generalization of the partial Theta function. Other equations are solved including the $(s,t)$-analog of the Bernoulli equation.</description>

      <title>General Christoffel Perturbations for Mixed Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing both right and left multiplication operations using general regular matrix polynomials, which need not be monic and may possess leading coefficients of arbitrary rank, on a rectangular matrix of measures associated with mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials, reveals corresponding Christoffel formulas. These formulas express the perturbed mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials in relation to the original ones. Utilizing the divisibility theorem for matrix polynomials, we establish a criterion for the existence of perturbed orthogonality, expressed through the non-cancellation of certain $\tau$ determinants.</description>

      <title>The extremal values of the ratio of differences of power mean, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper the maximum and the minimum of the ratio of the difference of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, and the difference of the power mean and the geometric mean of $n$ variables, is studied. A new optimization argument was used which reduces $n$ variable optimization problem to a single variable. All possible cases of the choice of the power mean and the choice of the number of variables of the means is studied. The obtained results generalize and complete the earlier results which were either for specific intervals of power means or for small number of variables of the means. Some of the results are formulated as the best constant inequalities involving interpolation of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean.</description>

      <title>A common zero at the end point of the support of measure for the quasi-natured spectrally transformed polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the explicit expressions of coefficients involved in quasi-type kernel polynomials of order one and quasi-Geronimus polynomials of order one are determined for Jacobi polynomials. These coefficients are responsible for establishing the orthogonality of quasi-spectral polynomials for Jacobi polynomials. Additionally, the orthogonality of quasi-type kernel Laguerre polynomials of order one is derived. In the process of achieving orthogonality, one zero in both cases is located on the boundary of the support of the measure. This allows us to derive the chain sequence and minimal parameter sequence at the point lying at the end point of the support of the measure. Also, this leads to the question of characterizing such spectrally transformed polynomials.
  Furthermore, the interlacing properties among the zeros of quasi-spectral orthogonal Jacobi polynomials and Jacobi polynomials are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Another look at the Matkowski and Weso{\l}owski problem yielding a new class of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following MW--problem was posed independently by Janusz Matkowski and Jacek Weso{\l}owski in different forms in 1985 and 2009, respectively: Are there increasing and continuous functions $\varphi\colon [0,1]\to [0,1]$, distinct from the identity on $[0,1]$, such that $\varphi(0)=0$, $\varphi(1)=1$ and $\varphi(x)=\varphi(\frac{x}{2})+\varphi(\frac{x+1}{2})-\varphi(\frac{1}{2})$ for every $x\in[0,1]$? By now, it is known that each of the de Rham functions $R_p$, where $p\in(0,1)$, is a solution of the MW--problem, and for any Borel probability measure $\mu$ concentrated on $(0,1)$ the formula $\phi_\mu(x)=\int_{(0,1)}R_p(x) d\mu(p)$ defines a solution $\phi_\mu\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ of this problem as well. In this paper, we give a new family of solutions of the MW--problem consisting of Cantor-type functions. We also prove that there are strictly increasing solutions of the MW--problem that are not of the above integral form with any Borel probability measure $\mu$.</description>

      <title>The Landis conjecture via Liouville comparison principle and criticality theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give partial affirmative answers to Landis conjecture in all dimensions for two different types of linear, second order, elliptic operators in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we provide a sharp decay criterion that ensures when a solution of a nonnegative Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a potential $V\leq 1$ is trivial. Moreover, we address the analogue of Landis conjecture for quasilinear problems. Our approach relies on the application of Liouville comparison principles and criticality theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral transformation associated with a perturbed $R_I$ type recurrence relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, orthogonal polynomials satisfying $R_I$ type recurrence relation %$\mathcal{P}_{n+1}(z) = (z-c_n)\mathcal{P}_n(z)-\lambda_n (z-a_n)\mathcal{P}_{n-1}(z),$ with $\mathcal{P}_{-1}(z) = 0$ and $\mathcal{P}_0(z) = 1$ are analyzed when the recurrence coefficients are modified. The structural relationship between the perturbed and the unperturbed polynomials along with the spectral properties and spectral transformation of continued fraction are investigated. It is demonstrated that the transfer matrix method is computationally more efficient than the classical method for obtaining perturbed $R_I$ polynomials. Further, an interesting consequence of co-dilation on the Carath\'eodary function is presented. Finally, the study of co-recursion and co-dilation in connection to the unit circle is carried out with the help of an illustration. The interlacing and monotonicity of zeros between L-Jacobi polynomials and their perturbed forms are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Co-Axial Metrics on the Sphere and Algebraic Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13912v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following curvature equation $$\Delta u+{\rm e}^u=4\pi\biggl((\theta_0-1)\delta_0+(\theta_1-1)\delta_1 +\sum_{j=1}^{n+m}\bigl(\theta_j'-1\bigr)\delta_{t_j}\biggr)\qquad \text{in}\ \mathbb R^2,$$ $$u(x)=-2(1+\theta_\infty)\ln|x|+O(1)\qquad \text{as} \ |x|\to\infty,$$
  where $\theta_0$, $\theta_1$, $\theta_\infty$, and $\theta_{j}'$ are positive non-integers for $1\le j\le n$, while $\theta_{j}'\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$ are integers for $n+1\le j\le n+m$. Geometrically, a solution $u$ gives rise to a conical metric ${\rm d}s^2=\frac12 {\rm e}^u|{\rm d}x|^2$ of curvature $1$ on the sphere, with conical singularities at $0$, $1$, $\infty$, and $t_j$, $1\le j\le n+m$, with angles $2\pi\theta_0$, $2\pi\theta_1$, $2\pi\theta_\infty$, and $2\pi\theta_{j}'$ at $0$, $1$, $\infty$, and $t_j$, respectively. The metric ${\rm d}s^2$ or the solution $u$ is called co-axial, which was introduced by Mondello and Panov, if there is a developing map $h(x)$ of $u$ such that the projective monodromy group is contained in the unit circle. The sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of angles for the existence of such metrics were obtained by Mondello-Panov (2016) and Eremenko (2020). In this paper, we fix the angles and study the locations of the singularities $t_1,\dots,t_{n+m}$. Let $A\subset\mathbb{C}^{n+m}$ be the set of those $(t_1,\dots,t_{n+m})$'s such that a co-axial metric exists, among other things we prove that (i) If $m=1$, i.e., there is only one integer $\theta_{n+1}'$ among $\theta_j'$, then $A$ is a finite set. Moreover, for the case $n=0$, we obtain a sharp bound of the cardinality of the set $A$. We apply a result due to Eremenko, Gabrielov, and Tarasov (2016) and the monodromy of hypergeometric equations to obtain such a bound. (ii) If $m\ge 2$, then $A$ is an algebraic set of dimension $\leq m-1$.</description>

Abstract: We retract the main theorem from the last versions since we have found a mistake. This paper was trying to quantify the methods used by Alexei Poltoratski to prove pointwise convergence of the non-linear Fourier transform. However, the latter also contains the same mistake. We leave the estimates that are still true in the form of Propositions.</description>

      <title>Traces of vanishing H\"older spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and the scales $\Gamma = \textit{small, large, far},$ we introduce and study the $\Gamma$-vanishing subspaces $\dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(E)\subset \dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ of the H\"older spaces. We find a single bounded linear extension operator that maps $\dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(E)\to \dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and works separately for each of the three vanishing scales. In fact, this follows as the zeroth order special case of a more general problem involving higher order derivatives. As a corollary, we obtain complete characterizations of approximability of H\"older functions $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ by Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions, for an arbitrary subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <title>A chronology of continued square roots and other continued compositions, through the year 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the $t_i$ are maps from a set $D$ to itself, the initial value $c$ is a point in $D$, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.
  This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and $f$-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the $t_i$ are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computational methods for the approximation of special functions recurrent in geometric function theory and quasiconformal mapping theory. The functions studied can be expressed as quotients of complete elliptic integrals and as inverses of such quotients. In particular, we consider the distortion function $\varphi_K(r)$ which gives a majorant for $|f(x)|$ when $f: \mathbb{B}^2 \to \mathbb{B}^2, f(0)=0,$ is a quasiconformal mapping of the unit disk $\mathbb{B}^2.$ It turns out that the approximation method is very simple: five steps of Landen iteration is enough to achieve machine precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new vanishing subspaces of the homogeneous H\"{o}lder space $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(X,Y),$ in the generality of a doubling modulus $\omega$ and normed spaces $X$ and $Y.$ For many couples $X,Y,$ we show these vanishing subspaces to completely characterize those H\"older functions that admit approximations, in the H\"{o}lder seminorm, by smooth, Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions. Beyond the intrinsic interest of these results, we also present connections to bi-parameter harmonic analysis on the Euclidean space and in particular to compactness of the bi-commutator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of shallow water wave model called the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (KP-BBM) equation. We firstly consider the unperturbed KP-BBM equation. Then by using the geometric singular perturbation (GSP) theory, especially the invariant manifold theory, method of dynamical system and Melnikov function, the existence of solitary wave solutions of perturbed KP-BBM equation is proved. In other words, we dissuss the equation under different nonlinear terms. Finally, we validate our results with numerical simulations.</description>
