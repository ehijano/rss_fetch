      <title>Ground states of nonlocal elliptic equations with general nonlinearities via Rayleigh quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established ground states and multiplicity of solutions for a nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  $(-\Delta )^s u + V(x) u = \lambda a(x) |u|^{q-2}u + b(x)f(u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N,$ $u \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N),$ where $0&lt;s&lt;\min\{1,N/2\},$ $1&lt;q&lt;2$ and $\lambda &gt;0,$ under general conditions over the measurable functions $a,$ $b$, $V$ and $f.$ The nonlinearity $f$ is superlinear at infinity and at the origin, and does not satisfy any Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type condition. It is considered that the weights $a$ and $b$ are not necessarily bounded and the potential $V$ can change sign. We obtained a sharp $\lambda^*&gt; 0$ which guarantees the existence of at least two nontrivial solutions for each $\lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$. Our approach is variational in its nature and is based on the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient method together with some fine estimates. Compactness of the problem is also considered.</description>

      <title>A sparse resolution of the DiPerna-Majda gap problem for $2$D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question which originates in the celebrated work in the 1980's of DiPerna and Majda asks what is the optimal decay $f &gt; 0$ such that uniform rates $|\omega|(Q) \leq f(|Q|)$ of the vorticity maximal functions guarantee strong convergence without concentrations of approximate solutions to energy-conserving weak solutions of the $2$D Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data. A famous result of Majda (1993) shows $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-1/2}$, $r&lt;1/2$, as the optimal decay for \emph{distinguished} sign vortex sheets. In the general setting of \emph{mixed} sign vortex sheets, DiPerna and Majda (1987) established $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 1$ as a sufficient condition for the lack of concentrations, while the expected gap $\alpha \in (1/2, 1]$ remains as an open question. In this paper we resolve the DiPerna-Majda $2$D gap problem: In striking contrast to the well-known case of distinguished sign vortex sheets, we identify $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-1}$ as the optimal regularity for mixed sign vortex sheets that rules out concentrations.
  For the proof, we propose a novel method to construct explicitly solutions with mixed sign to the $2$D Euler equations in such a way that wild behaviour creates within the relevant geometry of \emph{sparse} cubes (i.e., these cubes are not necessarily pairwise disjoint, but their possible overlappings can be controlled in a sharp fashion). Such a strategy is inspired by the recent work of the first author and Milman \cite{DM} where strong connections between energy conservation and sparseness are established.</description>

      <title>Discrete, Kinetic, and Hydrodynamic Descriptions of the Euler Alignment System with Adaptive Communication Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{s}$-model, introduced in arXiv:2211.00117, is an alignment model with the property that the strength of the alignment force, $\mathrm{s}$, is transported along an averaged velocity field. Inspired by the 1D threshold regularity criterion for the Cucker-Smale model in terms of the so-called $e$-quantity, $e = \partial_x u + \rho \ast \phi$, the transport of the strength in the $\mathrm{s}$-model was designed so that it possesses its own $e$-quantity, $e = \partial_x u + \mathrm{s}$. The $e$-quantity lends the $\mathrm{s}$-model to a similar threshold regularity criterion and long-time behavior in 1D, arXiv:2310.00269.
  The goal of this paper is to put the $\mathrm{s}$-model on more firm physical grounds by formulating and justifying the microscopic and mesoscopic descriptions from which it arises. A distinctive feature of the microscopic system is that it is a discrete-continuous system: the position and velocity of the particles are discrete objects, while the strength is an active continuum scalar function. We establish a rigorous passage from the microscopic to the mesoscopic description via the Mean Field Limit and a passage from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic description in the monokinetic and Maxwellian limiting regimes. We present a survey of such results for the Cucker-Smale model and explain how to extend these arguments to the $\mathrm{s}$-model, where the strength of the alignment force is transported. We also address the long-time behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation by establishing the relaxation to the Maxwellian in 1D when the velocity averaging is the Favre averaging. As a supplement to the numerical results already presented in arXiv:2310.00269, we provide additional numerical evidence, via a particle simulation, that the $\mathrm{s}$-model behaves qualitatively like Motsch-Tadmor.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for second order interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long time behavior of second order particle systems interacting through global Lipschitz kernels. Combining hypocoercivity method in [37] and relative entropy method in [25], we are able to overcome the degeneracy of diffusion in position direction by controlling the relative entropy and relative Fisher information together. This implies the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos through the strong convergence of all marginals. Our method works at the level of Liouville equation and relies on the log Sobolev inequality of equilibrium of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>A global regularity theory for shpere-valued fractional harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider sphere-valued stationary/minimizing fractional harmonic mappings introduced in recent years by several authors, especially by Millot-Pegon-Schikorra \cite{Millot-Pegon-Schikorra-2021-ARMA} and Millot-Sire \cite{Millot-Sire-15}. Based on their rich partial regularity theory, we establish a quantitative stratification theory for singular sets of these mappings by making use of the quantitative differentiation approach of Cheeger-Naber \cite{Cheeger-Naber-2013-CPAM}, from which a global regularity estimates follows.</description>

      <title>The emergence of nonlinear Jeans-type instabilities for quasilinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article contributes a key ingredient to the longstanding open problem of understanding the fully nonlinear version of Jeans instability, as highlighted by A. Rendall [Living Rev. Relativ. 8, 6 (2005)]. We establish a family of self-increasing blowup solutions for the following class of quasilinear wave equations that have not previously been studied: \begin{equation*} \partial^2_t \varrho- \biggl( \frac{ \mathsf{m}^2 (\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{(1+\varrho )^2} + 4(\mathsf{k}-\mathsf{m}^2)(1+\varrho )\biggr) \Delta \varrho = F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho) \end{equation*} where $F$ is given by \begin{equation*} F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho):= \underbrace{\frac{2}{3 } \varrho (1+ \varrho ) }_{ \text{(i) self-increasing}} \underbrace{-\frac{1}{3} \partial_{t}\varrho }_{ \text{(ii) damping}} + \underbrace{\frac{4}{3} \frac{(\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{1+\varrho } }_{\text{(iii) Riccati}} + \underbrace{ \biggl(\mathsf{m}^2 \frac{ (\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{(1+\varrho )^2} + 4(\mathsf{k}-\mathsf{m}^2) (1+\varrho ) \biggr) q^i \partial_{i}\varrho }_{\text{(iv) convection}} - \mathtt{K}^{ij} \partial_{i}\varrho\partial_{j}\varrho . \end{equation*} The result implies the solutions can attain arbitrarily large values over time, leading to self-increasing singularities at some future endpoints of null geodesics provided the inhomogeneous perturbations of data are sufficiently small. This phenomenon is referred to as the \textit{nonlinear Jeans-type instability} because this wave equation is closely related to the nonlinear version of the Jeans instability problem in the Euler--Poisson and Einstein--Euler systems, which characterizes the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe. The growth rate of $\varrho$ is significantly faster than that of the solutions to the classical linearized Jeans instability.</description>

      <title>A host-pathogen coevolution model. Part I: Run straight for your life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel model describing the coevolution between hosts and pathogens, based on a non-local partial differential equation formalism for populations structured by phenotypic traits. Our objective with this model is to illustrate scenarios corresponding to the evolutionary concept of ''Chase Red Queen scenario'', characterized by perpetual evolutionary chases between hosts and pathogens. First, numerical simulations show the emergence of such scenarios, depicting the escape of the host (in phenotypic space) pursued by the pathogen. We observe two types of behaviors, depending on the assumption about the presence of a phenotypic optimum for the host: either the formation of traveling pulses moving along a straight line with constant speed and constant profiles, or stable phenotypic distributions that periodically rotate along a circle in the phenotypic space. Through rigorous perturbation techniques and careful application of the implicit function theorem in rather intricate function spaces, we demonstrate the existence of the first type of behavior, namely traveling pulses moving with constant speed along a straight line. Just as the Lotka-Volterra models have revealed periodic dynamics without the need for environmental forcing, our work shows that, from the pathogen's point of view, various trajectories of mobile optima can emerge from coevolution with a host species.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problems for Screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse scattering from a screen with using only one incoming time--harmonic plane wave but with measurements of the scattered wave done at all directions. Especially we focus on the 2D--case i.e. (inverse) scattering from an open bounded smooth curve. Besides the inverse scattering problem we also study the inverse electrostatic problem. We then show that one Cauchy--data of any continuous and bounded function vanishing on the screen and harmonic outside it, determines the screen uniquely.</description>

      <title>Pointwise and uniform bounds for functions of the Laplacian on non-compact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the distinguished Laplacian on the Iwasawa $AN$ group associated with a semisimple Lie group $G$. Assume $F$ is a Borel function on $\mathbb{R}^+$. We give a condition on $F$ such that the kernels of the functions $F(L)$ are uniformly bounded. This condition involves the decay of $F$ only and not its derivatives. By a known correspondence, this implies pointwise estimates for a wide range of functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on symmetric spaces. In particular, when $G$ is of real rank one and $F(x)={\rm e}^{it\sqrt x}\psi(\sqrt x)$, our bounds are sharp.</description>

      <title>Refined existence theorems for doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption systems with large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the doubly degenerate nutrient model \begin{equation*}\label{AH1} \left\{ \begin{split} &amp;u_t=\nabla\cdot\left(u^{m-1}v\nabla u\right)-\nabla\cdot\left(f(u)v\nabla v\right)+\ell uv,&amp;&amp;x\in\Omega,\,t&gt;0, &amp;v_t=\Delta v-uv, &amp;&amp;x\in\Omega,\,t&gt;0, \end{split} \right. \end{equation*} under no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\le 2$), where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is assumed to satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha&gt;0$ and $C_f&gt;0$ for all $s\ge 1$. When $m=2$, it was shown that a global weak solution exists, either in one-dimensional setting with $\alpha=2$, or in two-dimensional version with $\alpha\in(1,\frac{3}{2})$. The main results in this paper assert the global existence of weak solutions for $1\le m&lt;3$ and classical solutions for $3\le m&lt;4$ to the above system under the assumption \begin{equation*} \alpha\in \left\{ \begin{split} &amp;\left[m-1,\min\left\{m,\frac{m}{2}+1\right\}\right]~~&amp;&amp;\textrm{if}~~n=1,\quad\quad\textrm{and} &amp;\left(m-1,\min\left\{m,\frac{m}{2}+1\right\}\right)~~&amp;&amp;\textrm{if}~~n=2, \end{split} \right. \end{equation*} which extend the range $\alpha\in(1,\frac{3}{2})$ to $\alpha\in(1,2)$ in two dimensions for the case $m=2$. Our proof will be based on a new observation on the coupled energy-type functional and on an inequality with general form.</description>

      <title>Sampling methods for recovering buried corroded boundaries from partial electrostatic Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse shape and parameter problem for detecting corrosion from partial boundary measurements. This problem models the non-destructive testing for a partially buried object from electrostatic measurements on the accessible part of the boundary. The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green's function which is needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the long-wave approximation of solitary waves in cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address justification and solitary wave solutions of the cylindrical KdV equation which is formally derived as a long wave approximation of radially symmetric waves in a two-dimensional nonlinear dispersive system. For a regularized Boussinesq equation, we prove error estimates between true solutions of this equation and the associated cylindrical KdV approximation in the L2-based spaces. The justification result holds in the spatial dynamics formulation of the regularized Boussinesq equation. We also prove that the class of solitary wave solutions considered previously in the literature does not contain solutions in the L2-based spaces. This presents a serious obstacle in the applicability of the cylindrical KdV equation for modeling of radially symmetric solitary waves since the long wave approximation has to be performed separately in different space-time regions.</description>

      <title>Global Solution of a Functional Hamilton-Jacobi Equation associated with a Hard Sphere Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years it has been shown for hard sphere gas that, by retaining the correlation information, dynamical fluctuation and large deviation of empirical measure around Boltzmann equation could be proved, in addition to the classical kinetic limit result by Lanford. After taking low-density limit, the correlation information can be encoded into a functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The results above are restricted to short time. This paper establishes global-in-time construction of a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, by analyzing a system of coupled Boltzmann equations. The global solution converges to a non-trivial stationary solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the long-time limit under proper assumptions.</description>

Previous results in this setting by M.A.H. Al-Jaboori and D. Wirosoetisno (2011) had proved that the global attractor collapses to a single point that depends only the longitudinal coordinate, i.e., zonal flow, when the rotation is sufficiently fast. However, an explicit quantification of the complexity of the global attractor in terms of $\beta$ had remained open. In this paper, such estimates are established which are valid across a wide regime of rotation rates and are consistent with the dynamically degenerate regime previously identified. Additionally, a decomposition of solutions is established detailing the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the limit of large rotation.</description>

      <title>Semi-local behaviour of non-local hypoelliptic equations: Boltzmann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to demonstrate the announced result in [Loher, The Strong Harnack inequality for the Boltzmann equation, S\'eminaire Laurent Schwartz proceeding] by filling the gap in the proof sketch. We prove the semi-local Strong Harnack inequality for the Boltzmann equation for moderately soft potentials without cutoff assumption. The non-local operator in the Boltzmann equation is in non-divergence form, and thus the method developed in [arXiv:2404.05612] does not apply. However, we exploit that the Boltzmann equation is on average in divergence form, and we show that the non-divergent part of the collision operator is of lower order in a suitable sense, which proves to be sufficient to deduce the Strong Harnack inequality. Consequentially, we derive upper and lower bounds on the fundamental solution of the linearised Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>From Finite to Continuous Phenotypes in (Visco-)Elastic Tissue Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a mathematical model for tissue growth focusing on the interplay between multiple cell subpopulations with distinct phenotypic characteristics. The model addresses the dynamics of tissue growth influenced by phenotype-dependent growth rates and collective population pressure, governed by Brinkman's law. We examine two primary objectives: the joint limit where viscosity tends to zero while the number of species approaches infinity, yielding an inviscid Darcy-type model with a continuous phenotype variable, and the continuous phenotype limit where the number of species becomes infinite with a fixed viscosity, resulting in a novel viscoelastic tissue growth model. In this sense, this paper provides a comprehensive framework that elucidates the relationships between four different modelling paradigms in tissue growth.</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the Kerr black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a purely physical-space analysis, we prove the precise oscillatory blow-up asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the interior of a subextremal Kerr black hole. In particular, this work gives a new proof of the blueshift instability of the Kerr Cauchy horizon against linearized gravitational perturbations that was first shown by Sbierski \cite{sbierski}. In that sense, this work supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. The proof is an extension to the Teukolsky equation of the work \cite{scalarMZ} by Ma and Zhang that treats the scalar wave equation in the interior of Kerr. The analysis relies on the generic polynomial decay on the event horizon of solutions of the Teukolsky equation that arise from compactly supported initial data, as recently proved by Ma and Zhang \cite{pricelaw} and Millet \cite{millet} in subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <title>Weak solution for Stochastic Degasperis-Procesi Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the existence of solution to the stochastic Degasperis-Procesi equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with an infinite dimensional multiplicative noise and integrable initial data.
  Writing the equation as a system composed of a stochastic nonlinear conservation law and an elliptic equation, we are able to develop a method based on the conjugation of kinetic theory with stochastic compactness arguments. More precisely, we first apply the stochastic Jakubowski-Skorokhod representation theorem to show the existence of a weak kinetic martingale solution.
  Next, we prove the pathwise uniqueness and invoke the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem to conclude that the solution is strong in the probabilistic sense.
  In this framework, the solution is a stochastic process with sample paths in Lebesgue spaces, which are compatible with peakons and wave breaking physical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stability of standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates. Since solutions of the linearized MTM equation are related to the squared eigenfunctions of the linear Lax system, the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves can be studied by using their Lax spectrum. Standing periodic waves are classified based on eight eigenvalues which coincide with the endpoints of the spectral bands of the Lax spectrum. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the standing periodic waves are spectrally stable if and only if the eight eigenvalues are located either on the imaginary axis or along the diagonals of the complex plane.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional periodic cubic nonlinear fractional Schr{\"o}dinger equation (FNLS) with initial data distributed via its associated Gibbs measure. We construct global strong solutions with the flow property for the FNLS on the support of the Gibbs measure in the full dispersive range, thus resolving a question proposed by Sun-Tzvetkov (2021). As a byproduct, we prove the invariance of the Gibbs measure and almost sure global well-posedness for FNLS.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the upper bound of the lifespan of classical solutions of the initial value problems for one dimensional wave equations with quasilinear terms of space-, or time-derivatives of the unknown function. The results are same as those of the semilinear case. But it is quite meaningful to consider this kind of problems for the purpose to cover the optimality of the general theory for nonlinear wave equations by many model equations as far as possible.</description>

      <title>On certain classes of mild solutions of the scalar Li\'enard equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of some classes of mild solutions which are almost periodic (AP-), asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) and pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) of the scalar Lin\'eard equation by employing the notion of Green function and Massera-type principle. First, by changing variable we convert this equation to a system of first order differential equations. Then, we transform the problem into a framework of an abstract parabolic evolution equation which associates with an evolution family equipped an exponential dichtonomy and the corresponding Green function is exponentially almost periodic. After that, we prove a Massera-type principle that the corresponding linear equation has a uniqueness AP-, AAP- and PAP- mild solution if the right hand side and the coefficient functions are AP-, AAP- and PAP- functions, respectively. The well-posedness of semilinear equation is proved by using fixed point arguments and the exponential decay of mild solutions are obtained by using Gronwall's inequality. Although our work revisits some previous works on well-posedness of the Lin\'eard equation on these type solutions but provide a difference view by using Green function and go farther on the aspects of asymptotic behaviour of solutions and the construction of abstract theory. Our abstract results can be also applied to other parabolic evolution equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational interpolants are an indispensable tool for the construction of gradient-flow solutions via the Minimizing Movement Scheme. De Giorgi's lemma provides the associated discrete energy-dissipation inequality. It was originally developed for metric gradient systems. Drawing from this theory we study the case of generalized gradient systems in Banach spaces, where a refined theory allows us to extend the validity of the discrete energy-dissipation inequality and to establish it as an equality. For the latter we have to impose the condition of radial differentiability of the dissipation potential. Several examples are discussed to show how sharp the results are.</description>

      <title>A microlocal investigation of stochastic partial differential equations for spinors with an application to the Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a $d$-dimensional Riemannian, spin manifold $(M,g)$ we consider non-linear, stochastic partial differential equations for spinor fields, driven by a Dirac operator and coupled to an additive Gaussian, vector-valued white noise. We extend to the case in hand a procedure, introduced in [DDRZ20] for the scalar counterpart, which allows to compute at a perturbative level the expectation value of the solutions as well as the associated correlation functions accounting intrinsically for the underlying renormalization freedoms. This framework relies strongly on tools proper of microlocal analysis and it is inspired by the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. As a concrete example we apply it to a stochastic version of the Thirring model proving in particular that it lies in the subcritical regime if $d\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>
