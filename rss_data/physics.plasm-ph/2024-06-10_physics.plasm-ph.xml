      <title>Efficient backward x-ray emission in a finite-length plasma irradiated by a laser pulse of ps duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments employing ps-long, kilojoule laser pulses, we examined x-ray emission in a finite-length underdense plasma irradiated by such a pulse using two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We found that, in addition to the expected forward emission, the plasma also efficiently emits in the backward direction. Our simulations reveal that the backward emission occurs when the laser exits the plasma. The longitudinal plasma electric field generated by the laser at the density down-ramp turns around some of the laser-accelerated electrons and re-accelerates them in the backward direction. As the electrons collide with the laser, they emit hard x-rays. The energy conversion efficiency is comparable to that for the forward emission, but the effective source size is smaller. We show that the ps laser duration is required for achieving a spatial overlap between the laser and the backward energetic electrons. At peak laser intensity of $1.4\times 10^{20}~\rm{W/cm^2}$, backward emitted photons (energies above 100~keV and $10^{\circ}$ divergence angle) account for $2 \times 10^{-5}$ of the incident laser energy. This conversion efficiency is three times higher than that for similarly selected forward emitted photons. The source size of the backward photons ($5~\rm{\mu m}$) is three times smaller than the source size of the forward photons.</description>

      <title>Stability impacts from the current and pressure profile modifications within finite sized island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability (or instability) of finite sized magnetic island could play a significant role in disruption avoidance or disruption mitigation dynamics. Especially, various current and pressure profile modifications, such as the current drive and heating caused by electron cyclotron wave, or the radiative cooling and current expulsion caused by the Shattered Pellet Injection could be applied within the island to modify its stability, thus change the ensuing dynamics. In this study, we calculate the mode structure modification caused by such profile changes within the island using the perturbed equilibrium approach, thus obtain the change of stability criterion $\gD'$ and assess the corresponding quasi-linear island stability. The positive helical current perturbation is found to always stabilize the island, while the negative one is found to do the opposite, in agreement with previous results. The pressure bump or hole within the island has a more complicated stability impact. In the small island regime, its contribution is monotonic, with pressure bump tends to stabilize the island while pressure hole destabilizes it. This effect is relatively weak, though, due to the cancellation of the pressure term's odd parity contribution in the second derivatives of the mode structure. In the large island regime, such cancellation is broken due to the island asymmetry, and the pressure contribution to stability is manifested, which is non-monotonic. The stability analysis in this paper helps to more accurately clarify the expected island response in the presence of profile modifications caused by disruption avoidance or mitigation systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmoid drift and first wall heat deposition during ITER H-mode dual-SPIs in JOREK simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat flux mitigation during the Thermal Quench (TQ) by the Shattered Pellet Injection (SPI) is one of the major elements of disruption mitigation strategy for ITER. It's efficiency greatly depends on the SPI and the target plasma, and is ultimately checked by the heat deposition on to the PFCs. To investigate this, JOREK simulations of neon-mixed dual-SPIs into ITER baseline H-mode and a "degraded H-mode" with and without good injector synchronization are performed with focus on the first wall heat flux and its energy impact. It is found that low neon fraction SPIs into the baseline H-mode plasmas exhibit strong major radial plasmoid drift as the fragments arrive at the pedestal, accompanied by edge stochasticity. Significant density expulsion and outgoing heat flux occurs as a result, reducing the mitigation efficiency. Such drift motion could be mitigated by injecting higher neon fraction pellets', or by considering the pre-disruption confinement degradation, thus improving the radiation fraction. The radiation heat flux is found to peak in the vicinity of the fragment injection location in the early injection phase, while it relaxes later on due to parallel impurity transport. The overall radiation asymmetry could be significantly mitigated by good synchronization. Time integration of the local heat flux is carried out to provide its energy impact for wall heat damage assessment. For the baseline H-mode case with full pellet injection, melting of the stainless steel of the diagnostic port could occur near the injection port, which is acceptable, without any melting of the first wall tungsten tiles. For the degraded H-mode cases with quarter-pellet SPIs, which have 1/4 total volume of a full pellet, the maximum energy impact approaches the tolerable limit of the stainless steel with un-synchronized SPIs, and stays well below such limit for the perfectly synchronized ones.</description>

      <title>Impact of pressure anisotropy on the cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with bi-adiabatic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of ion pressure anisotropy on the energy cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with bi-adiabatic ions and isothermal electrons is evaluated in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, using the exact law derived in Simon and Sahraoui (2022). It is shown that pressure anisotropy can enhance or reduce the cascade rate, depending on the scales, in comparison with the prediction of the exact law with isotropic pressure, by an amount that correlates well with pressure anisotropy $a_p=\frac{p_\perp}{p_\parallel}\neq1$ developing in simulations initialized with an isotropic pressure (${a_p}_0=1$). A simulation with an initial pressure anisotropy, ${a_p}_0=4$, confirms this trend, yielding a stronger impact on the cascade rate, both in the inertial range and at larger scales, close to the forcing. Furthermore, a Fourier-based numerical method to compute the exact laws in numerical simulations in the full $(\ell_\perp,\ell_\parallel)$ scale separation plane is presented.</description>

      <title>The theory of resonant cosmic ray-driven instabilities -- Growth and saturation of single modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles' orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly towards the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR back-reaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our novel fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward and backward propagating Alfv\'en and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a fundamental revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Magnetic Reconnection in Dynamically Evolving Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the onset of magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability in dynamically thinning current sheets in the solar corona. In all our simulations, the onset of the non-linear tearing instability, which leads to the break-up of the thinning current sheet, does not occur until after the instability growth time becomes faster than the dynamic thinning time. Furthermore, as in previous 3D MHD simulations of static current sheets in the corona, for some parameters, the amount of magnetic shear is a fundamental switch-on parameter, which has consequences for coronal heating models. These results open up the possibility of using observable quantities of coronal current sheets to predict when they will break-up and release magnetic energy to power various energetic phenomena and/or heat the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A fully plasma based electron injector for a linear collider or XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate through high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations a simple approach for efficiently generating 20+ GeV electron beams with the necessary charge, energy spread, and emittance for use as the injector for an electron arm of a future linear collider or a next generation XFEL. The self-focusing of an unmatched, relatively low quality, drive beam results in self-injection by elongating the wakefield excited in the nonlinear blowout regime. Over pump depletion distances, the drive beam dynamics and self-loading from the injected beam leads to extremely high quality and high energy output beams. For plasma densities of $10^{18} \ \text{cm}^{-3}$, PIC simulation results indicate that self-injected beams with $0.52 \ \text{nC}$ of charge can be accelerated to $\sim 20$ GeV energies with projected energy spreads, $\lesssim 1\%$ within the beam core, slice normalized emittances as low as $110 \ \text{nm}$, a peak normalized brightness $\gtrsim 10^{19} \ \text{A}/\text{m}^2/\text{rad}^2$, and energy transfer efficiencies $\gtrsim 54\%$.</description>

      <title>Dephasingless two-color terahertz generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A laser pulse composed of a fundamental and an appropriately phased second harmonic can drive a time-dependent current of photoionized electrons that generates broadband THz radiation. Over the propagation distances relevant to many experiments, dispersion causes the relative phase between the harmonics to evolve. This "dephasing" slows the accumulation of THz energy and results in a multi-cycle THz pulse with significant angular dispersion. Here, we introduce a novel optical configuration that compensates the relative phase evolution, allowing for the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with almost no angular dispersion. The configuration uses the spherical aberration of an axilens to map a prescribed radial phase variation in the near field to a desired longitudinal phase variation in the far field. Simulations that combine this configuration with an ultrashort flying focus demonstrate the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with a controlled emission angle and 1/4 the angular divergence of the multi-cycle pulse created by a conventional optical configuration.</description>
