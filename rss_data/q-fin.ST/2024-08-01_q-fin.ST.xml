      <title>Reinforcement Learning in High-frequency Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Risk Measurement by SV-GARCH-EVT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09434v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to more effectively manage and mitigate stock market risks by accurately characterizing financial market returns and volatility. We enhance the Stochastic Volatility (SV) model by incorporating fat-tailed distributions and leverage effects, estimating model parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. By integrating extreme value theory (EVT) to fit the tail distribution of standard residuals, we develop the SV-EVT-VaR-based dynamic model. Our empirical analysis, using daily S\&amp;P 500 index data and simulated returns, shows that SV-EVT-based models outperform others in backtesting. These models effectively capture the fat-tailed properties of financial returns and the leverage effect, proving superior for out-of-sample data analysis.</description>
