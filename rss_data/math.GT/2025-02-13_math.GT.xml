      <title>Matsumoto dichotomy on foliated $S^1$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ergodic harmonic measure on a foliated circle bundle over a closed hyperbolic manifold, Matsumoto constructed a map from the fiber circle to the space of nonempty closed subsets of the boundary sphere of the universal cover of the base manifold. This map is well-defined at almost every point. Also, the map is equivariant under two actions of the fundamental group of the base manifold: the holonomy action on the fiber and the action on the space of closed subsets induced by the boundary sphere action.
  Matsumoto established a dichotomy for these maps, which corresponds to a dichotomy of ergodic harmonic measures. (Indeed, the Matsumoto dichotomy also concerns ergodic harmonic measures on compact hyperbolic laminations.) The dichotomy says that a Matsumoto map either maps each point to a singleton (Type I) or to the entire sphere (Type II).
  In this paper, we study actions of closed hyperbolic manifold groups on the circle in the context of the Matsumoto dichotomy. We essentially show that the suspension of any action with a non-discrete image cannot admit a Matsumoto map of type I under the condition of a uniformly bounded number of fixed points. As a consequence, we address a question posed in Matsumoto's paper.</description>

      <title>An extended symmetric union and its Alexander polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For prime knots $K_1$ and $K_2$, we write $K_1 \geq K_2$ if there is an epimorphism from the knot group of $K_1$ to that of $K_2$ which preserves the meridian. We construct a family of pairs of knots with $K_1 \geq K_2$ such that an epimorphism maps the longitude of $K_1$ to the trivial element. This construction is regarded as an extension of a symmetric union with a single full twisted region. In particular, it extends a property of the Alexander polynomial of a symmetric union. We also exhibit that all but two of the knots up to ten crossings in the list of Kitano-Suzuki, which have an epimorphism mapping the longitude to the trivial element, arise from this construction.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of partial coverings defined from closed geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite volume hyperbolic surface, a fundamental polygon and an oriented closed geodesic, we associate a partial covering of the surface. We prove that given a sequence of collections of oriented closed geodesics equidistributing in the unit tangent bundle then the associated partial coverings also equidistribute. In the case of the modular group, this yields an alternative proof of an equidistribution result due to Duke, Imamo\={g}lu, and T\'{o}th.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives the first examples of gordian unlinks. The components of these unlinks cannot be separated while maintaining constant length and thickness. We construct infinite families of 2-component gordian unlinks and also construct $n$-component gordian unlinks for each $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Torus knotted Reeb dynamics and the Calabi invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a secondary Reeb orbit set with quantitative action and linking bounds for any contact form on the standard tight three-sphere admitting the standard transverse positive $T(p,q)$ torus knot as an elliptic Reeb orbit with a canonically determined rotation number. This can be interpreted through an ergodic lens for Reeb flows transverse to a surface of section. Our results also allow us to deduce an upper bound on the mean action of periodic orbits of naturally associated classes of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the associated Seifert surfaces of genus $(p-1)(q-1)/2$ in terms of the Calabi invariant, without the need for genericity or Hamiltonian hypotheses. Our proofs utilize knot filtered embedded contact homology, which was first introduced and computed by Hutchings for the standard transverse unknot in the irrational ellipsoids and further developed in our previous work. We continue our development of nontoric methods for embedded contact homology and establish the knot filtration on the embedded contact homology chain complex of the standard tight three-sphere with respect to positive $T(p,q)$ torus knots, where there are nonvanishing differentials. We also obtain obstructions to the existence of exact symplectic cobordisms between positive transverse torus knots.</description>

      <title>Crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crystallization of a PL manifold is an edge-colored graph that corresponds to a contracted triangulation of the manifold, facilitating the study of its topological and combinatorial properties. A small cover over a simple convex $n$-polytope $P^n$ is a closed $n$-manifold with a locally standard $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-action such that its orbit space is homeomorphic to $P^n$. In this article, we study the crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$. It is known that the small cover over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is $\mathbb{RP}^n$. For every $n\geq 2$, we prove that $\mathbb{RP}^n$ has a unique $2^n$-vertex crystallization. We also demonstrate that there are exactly $1 + 2^{n-1}$ D-J equivalence classes of small covers over the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, where $n\geq 3$. For each $\mathbb{Z}_2$-characteristic function of $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, we construct a $2^{n-1}(n+1)$-vertex crystallization of the small cover $M^n(\lambda)$ with regular genus $1 + 2^{n-4}(n^2 - 2n - 3)$, where $n\geq 4$. In particular, we construct four orientable and four non-orientable $\mathbb{RP}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{S}^1$ up to D-J equivalence with regular genus 6.</description>
