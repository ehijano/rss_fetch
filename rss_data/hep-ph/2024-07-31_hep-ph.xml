      <title>Universal New Physics Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning method for mapping data originating from both Standard Model processes and various theories beyond the Standard Model into a unified representation (latent) space while conserving information about the relationship between the underlying theories. We apply our method to three examples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that models can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models are mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models are mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several fronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark scenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.</description>

      <title>Finding excesses in model parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) makes it possible to infer the parameters of a model from high-dimensional low-level features of the observed events. In this work we show how this method can be used to establish the presence of a weak signal on top of an unknown background, to discard background events and to determine the signal properties. The key idea is to use SBI methods to identify events that are similar to each other in the sense that they agree on the inferred model parameters. We illustrate this method for the case of axion-like particles decaying to photons at beam-dump experiments. For poor detector resolution the diphoton mass cannot be reliably reconstructed, so there is no simple high-level observable that can be used to perform a bump hunt. Since the SBI methods do not require explicit high-level observables, they offer a promising alternative to increase the sensitivity to new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the discovery and characterisation of toponium production at the Large Hadron Collider. In the dilepton decay mode, multivariate analyses of spin and colour observables could provide evidence that an excess of events present near the $t \bar t$ threshold corresponds to a spin-zero colour singlet. The semileptonic decay mode may also exhibit an excess near threshold, but is not expected to play any role in the toponium characterisation.</description>

      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>Constraints on non-unitary neutrino mixing in light of atmospheric and reactor neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the origin of neutrino masses remains unknown, several key neutrino mass generation models result in a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix. To put such models to test, the deviations of the mixing matrix from unitarity can be measured directly through neutrino oscillation experiments. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the non-unitary mixing model using the recent public data from atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments - namely IceCube-DeepCore, Daya Bay, and KamLAND. The novelty of our approach compared to the preceding global fits for non-unitarity is in the detailed treatment of the atmospheric neutrino data, which for the first time includes the relevant flux and detector systematic uncertainties. From the Bayesian posteriors on the individual mixing matrix elements, we derive the non-unitarity constraints in the form of normalisations and closures of the mixing matrix rows and columns. We find comparable constraints for electron and tau row normalisations as other similar studies in literature, and additionally reveal strong correlations between muon and tau row constraints induced by the atmospheric systematic uncertainties. We find that the current data is well described by both unitary and non-unitary mixing models, with a strong preference for the unitary mixing indicated by the Bayes factor. With the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade and JUNO detectors, both featuring superior energy resolution compared to the current atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, our constraints on the row normalisations are expected to improve by a factor of 2 (3) in the tau (muon) sector and by nearly 25% in the electron sector. In the future, our approach can be expanded to include solar and long-baseline neutrino experiments, with the aim to provide more stringent constraints while keeping track of the nuisance parameters that may be degenerate with non-unitarity.</description>

      <title>$C\!P$ asymmetries corresponding to the imaginary parts of the interference terms in cascade decays of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism of generating CP violation through the imaginary part of the interference of two amplitudes is proposed. This mechanism has shown clear evidence in decays such as $B^\pm\to \pi^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$. The proposed mechanism is helpful in searching for CP violation in bottom and charmed baryon decay processes.</description>

      <title>A GUT Framework for Accidental Composite Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and classify $SU(5)$-GUT completions of accidental composite dark matter models. These theories postulate new vectorlike confining dark color dynamics and give an accidentally stable baryonic dark matter candidate. In realistic theories, dark fermion $SU(5)$ irreps split into light dark quarks, whose bound states include the dark matter, and their much heavier GUT partners. A simple analysis shows that such a mass hierarchy requires a fine tuning of parameters and thus implies a naturalness problem. We select theories requiring that all dangerous metastable states decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis through higher-dimensional operators generated at the GUT scale or at the mass scale of dark quark GUT partners. Demanding Standard Model gauge coupling unification puts severe constraints on the landscape of viable theories. Under the assumption of an approximately degenerate spectrum of dark quark GUT partners, we find that only one model gives precision unification.</description>

      <title>Prospects of five-dimensional $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge interactions in the light of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings: the scope of the DUNE near detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the future prospects of a minimally five-dimensional version of the well-motivated scenario for addressing the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ extension of the standard model (SM) gauge symmetry. Here, multiple associated massive gauge bosons appear thanks to the five-dimensional $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry, and they contribute to the muon $(g-2)$ and also other processes. We focus on the powerful probe of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings since the upcoming DUNE experiment will explore MeV-scale uncharted regions by previous experiments (e.g., CHARM-II and Borexino) in the near future. We found that even with small kinetic mixing parameters, much of the parameter space, including those satisfying muon $(g-2)$, can be probed using several years of data from the DUNE experiment, focusing on the near detector. In our scenario, interference effects between intermediate-state gauge bosons play an important role. Our results include comparisons between flat and warped extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal pressures from light scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origin of Neutrino Masses through Displaced Shower Searches in the CMS Muon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential to probe the origin of neutrino masses, by searching for long-lived right-handed neutrinos~(RHNs) $N$ in the $B-L$ gauge model. Despite the small active-sterile mixing $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, RHNs are produced abundantly via SM and exotic Higgs production, as long as the Higgs mixing is sufficiently large. We reinterpret a search for displaced showers in the CMS muon system and we find that it is sensitive to parameter space at and below the canonical seesaw floor, $|V_{\ell N}|^2 \approx 10^{-12}$ ($\ell = e$, $\tau$) for $m_N \approx 40$ GeV. With existing data constraining such a well-motivated scenario of neutrino mass generation, we determine the projected sensitivity at the HL-LHC, motivating dedicated searches for long-lived RHNs with decay lengths $\approx 10$ m.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>HEFT's appraisal of triple (versus double) Higgs weak boson fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Higgs boson interactions with massive gauge bosons are known to be tell-tale probes of the vacuum manifold of electroweak symmetry breaking. Phenomenologically, a precise determination of these parameters is hampered through increasingly rare processes at the presently available energy frontier provided by the Large Hadron Collider. Contact interactions of three Higgs bosons with the $W$ and $Z$ bosons seem currently well out of experimental reach due to an irrelevant SM production cross section. From a theoretical perspective, in perturbative extensions of the SM such interactions are suppressed by weak loops and further diluted in a priori sensitive processes like weak boson fusion (WBF) when they admit a dimension-six Standard Model Effective Field Theory description. In this work, we identify scenarios that can indeed lead to large, and perhaps even observable modifications of WBF triple Higgs production most directly parametrised by Higgs Effective Field Theory. We critically analyse these enhancements at the LHC and future colliders from the perspective of unitarity and demonstrate the radiative stability of such analyses under QCD corrections at hadron colliders. In passing, we also comment on the expected sensitivity at non-hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Multi-$Z'$ signatures of spontaneously broken local $U(1)'$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss multi-$Z'$ signatures coming from decays of Higgs bosons in models with a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ symmetry, which can be observed as "lepton jets" or multi-lepton final states depending on the mass range of new bosons. We consider anomaly-free $U(1)'$ models without introducing new fermions except for right-handed neutrinos, in which the Higgs sector is composed of an isospin doublet and a singlet fields with zero and non-zero $U(1)'$ charges, respectively. The multi-$Z'$ signatures can then be obtained via the decays of the discovered (extra) Higgs boson $h$ ($\phi$), i.e., $h\to Z'Z'$, $\phi \to Z'Z'$ and/or $h \to \phi\phi \to 4Z'$ as far as kinematically allowed. We give the upper limit on the branching ratios of $h$ into $Z'Z'$ and $4Z'$ from the current experimental data in each model. We also show the deviation in the $hhh$ coupling from the standard model prediction at one-loop level, and find that its amount is typically smaller than 1\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective axion fields in condensed matter and photonics are manifested as $\mathcal{P}$- and $\mathcal{T}$-odd contributions to the electromagnetic response. Here, we show that the phenomena previously attributed to the effective axion fields have two distinct physical origins. One of them corresponds to the standard axion electrodynamics, while another provides its dual-symmetric version having the same symmetry and featuring similar but distinguishable optical properties. We present an example system described by the dual-symmetric modification of axion electrodynamics, derive the key predictions and pinpoint experimentally observable distinctions between the two versions of axion-type response.</description>

      <title>Two-photon decay of para-positronium within a composite approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the para-positronium into two photons is studied in the framework of a composite Quantum Field Theoretical approach. This amounts to the evaluation of the electron-positron dressing together with the Weinberg compositeness condition for the positronium and the triangle-shaped diagram with virtual electrons circulating in it, leading to the two-photon final state. An important role is played by the positronium-electron-positron vertex, which is linked to the wave function of the para-positronium. We show how possible choices for the vertex function affect the $\gamma \gamma$ decay rate. Outlooks to other decay channels and to other positronia are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD calculations for collider physics make use of perturbative solutions of renormalisation group equations (RGEs). Ambiguities related to these solutions can contribute significantly to systematic uncertainties of theoretical predictions for physical observables. We propose a general method to estimate these systematic effects using techniques inspired by soft-gluon and transverse-momentum resummation approaches. We first discuss the cases of the evolution of strong coupling $\alpha_s$, collinear parton-distribution functions (PDFs), and transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). We then study the implications for precision observables in hadron-collider processes, such as the deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and the transverse-momentum distribution of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan production.</description>

      <title>System size dependence of energy loss and correlations of heavy mesons at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the system size dependence of heavy quark (HQ) observables at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV to explore whether it can provide further constraints on the physical processes which are involved: energy loss of HQs in the quark gluon plasma (QGP), hadronization and hadronic rescattering. We use the EPOS4HQ approach to study p-p and 0-10\% central O-O, Ar-Ar, Kr-Kr and Pb-Pb reactions and investigate in detail the momentum change of heavy quarks from creation until their detection as part of a hadron as well as the enhancement of heavy baryon production at low $p_T$. We investigate furthermore the origin and the system size dependence of the azimuthal correlations between the heavy quark $Q$ and the heavy antiquark $\bar Q$ and how one can bypass the problem that correlations are washed out due to the combinatorial background. We conclude that a systematic study of the system size dependence of the momentum loss allows to separate the momentum loss due to the passage through the QGP from the momentum change due to hadronization and the $Q\bar Q$ correlations allow to gain inside into the different pQCD processes in which the heavy quarks are created.</description>

      <title>Track signals at IceCube from subleading channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracks events at the IceCube Observatory are characterized by an energetic muon crossing several kilometers before decaying. Such muons are dominantly produced in charged current (CC) muon neutrino - hadron interactions. However, muons are also produced through the $W$ - boson production and in the decay of tau leptons and heavy mesons created in neutral and charged current interactions induced by all neutrino flavors. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of these subleading channels to events characterized as tracks at the IceCube. Our results indicate that these channels correspond to a non - negligible fraction of the HESE track events. In addition, we show that its contributions are concentrated in muons that are less energetic than those arising from muonic neutrino CC interactions for the same visible energies of the process. Finally, we investigate the impact of these additional channels on the description of the astrophysical neutrino flux, and we find that the inclusion of these subleading processes are important in determining the parameters of the astrophysical neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>GeV scale dark matter and $B\rightarrow K+$ missing energy phenomenology in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the recently observed discrepancy in the branching ratio of $B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}$ +inv decay mode using a GeV scale scalar dark matter in an anomaly-free $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. We constrain the new parameters by using consistency with the existing bounds on Dark matter relic density, direct detection, collider and BR($B\rightarrow K^*\nu\bar{\nu}$) measured at the Belle II experiment. We investigate couplings between the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle. We then estimate the branching ratios of $b \to s \nu \bar \nu$ decay processes such as $B\rightarrow (K^+,K^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B_s\rightarrow (\eta,\eta')\nu\bar{\nu}$, $ B_s\rightarrow \phi\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $B_c\rightarrow (D_s, D_s^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$ in a common parameter space, meeting the current experimental bounds of both sectors simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning models applied to direct dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.</description>

Abstract: The compacton, peakon, and Burgers-Hopf equations regularized by the Galerkin truncation preserving finite Fourier modes are found to support new travelling waves and interacting solitonic structures amidst weaker less-ordered components (`longons'). Different perspectives focusing on the zero-Hamiltonian solitonic, chaotic-looking, and stationary longons are also offered.</description>

      <title>Can we learn from matter creation to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_{0}$ tension problem is studied in the light of a matter creation mechanism (an effective approach to replacing dark energy), the way to define the matter creation rate being of pure phenomenological nature. Bayesian (probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free parameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated expansion rate, $H(z)$. Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for three redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges: $z\in [0,2]$~(cosmic chronometers) and $z\in [0,2.5]$~(cosmic chronometers + BAO), covering already available $H(z)$ data, to validate the learned results; and for a third redshift interval, $z\in[0,5]$, for forecasting purposes. It is learned that the $3\alpha H_{0}$ term in the creation rate provides options that have the potential to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem.</description>

      <title>Horndeski speed tests with scalar-photon couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit multi-messenger constraints from neutron star mergers on the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories. By considering non-trivial couplings between the dark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can propagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the phenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular, we show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories disformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit speed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational couplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We also consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with second order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with constraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>WZW terms without anomalies: generalised symmetries in chiral Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a 4d non-linear sigma model on the coset $(\mathrm{SU}(N)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(N)_R \times \mathrm{SU}(2))/(\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}\times \mathrm{U}(1))\cong \mathrm{SU}(N) \times S^2$, that features a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term whose curvature is $\frac{n}{24\pi^2}\mathrm{Tr}(g^{-1}dg)^3 \wedge \mathrm{Vol}_{S^2}$ where $g$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pion field. This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin in QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not obviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to unlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a 1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$ flavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the 2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like completions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a weakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an abelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding number current of a $\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed WZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the number of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact' to satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate the more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an anomaly-free subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a phenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic abundance of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory and the Limits of Reductionism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I suggest that the current situation in quantum field theory (QFT) provides some reason to question the universal validity of ontological reductionism. I argue that the renormalization group flow is reversible except at fixed points, which makes the relation between large and small distance scales quite symmetric in QFT, opening up at least the technical possibility of a non-reductionist approach to QFT. I suggest that some conceptual problems encountered within QFT may potentially be mitigated by moving to an alternative picture in which it is no longer the case that the large supervenes on the small. Finally, I explore some specific models in which a form of non-reductionism might be implemented, and consider the prospects for future development of these models.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic GUP and Thermodynamic Dimensional Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the statistical mechanics within the Linear-Quadratic GUP (LQGUP, i.e, GUP with linear and quadratic terms in momentum) models in the semiclassical regime. Then, some thermodynamic properties of a system of 3-dimensional harmonic oscillators are investigated by calculating the deformed partition functions. According to the equipartition theorem, we show that the number of accessible microstates decreases sharply in the very high temperatures regime. When the thermal de Broglie wavelength is of the order of the Planck length, three degrees of freedom are frozen in this setup. In other words, it is observed that there is an effective reduction of the degrees of freedom from 6 to 3 for a system of 3D harmonic oscillators in this framework. The calculations are carried out using both approximate analytical and exact numerical methods. The results of the analytical method are also presented in the form of thermal wavelengths for better understanding. Finally, the case of a 2-dimensional harmonic is treated as another example to comprehend the results, leading to a reduction of the degrees of freedom from 4 to 2.</description>

      <title>Inspecting neutrino flavor instabilities during proto-neutron star cooling phase in supernova: I. Spherically symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard model of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), all neutrinos are assumed to be in pure flavor eigenstates in CCSN cores, but the assumption becomes invalid if neutrino distributions are unstable to flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a study of the occurrences of two representative neutrino-flavor instabilities, fast- and collisional flavor instabilities, in the cooling phase of proto-neutron star (PNS) from 1- to 50 seconds. We follow the long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static approximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment of multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino flavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo transport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute the dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models; the physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative conclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if multi-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier phase of CCSN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the vector-isovector timelike form-factors of the pion and the kaon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. We calculate two-point correlation functions with $m_\pi \sim 280$ MeV, extracting both the finite-volume spectrum and matrix elements for these states created from the vacuum by a vector current. After determining the coupled-channel $\pi\pi, K\overline{K}$ scattering amplitudes, we perform the necessary correction for the significant finite-volume effects present in the current matrix elements, leading to the timelike form-factors. We find these to be dominated by the presence of the $\rho$ resonance, and we extract its decay constant by an analytic continuation of the amplitudes to the resonance pole. In addition, the spacelike pion form-factor is determined on the same lattice configurations, and a dispersive parameterization is used to simultaneously describe the spacelike and elastic timelike regions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the light of the evidence of a gravitational wave background from the NANOGrav 15yr data set, we reconsider the split majoron model as a new physics extension of the standard model able to generate a needed contribution to solve the current tension between the data and the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole massive binaries. In the split majoron model the seesaw right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses from spontaneous symmetry breaking of global $U(1)_{B-L}$ in a strong first order phase transition of a complex scalar field occurring above the electroweak scale. The final vacuum expectation value couples to a second complex scalar field undergoing a low scale phase transition occurring after neutrino decoupling. Such a coupling enhances the strength of this second low scale first order phase transition and can generate a sizeable primordial gravitational wave background contributing to the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Some amount of extra-radiation is generated after neutron-to-proton ration freeze-out but prior to nucleosynthesis. This can be either made compatible with current upper bound from primordial deuterium measurements or even be used to solve a potential deuterium problem. Moreover, the free streaming length of light neutrinos can be suppressed by their interactions with the resulting majoron background and this mildly ameliorates existing cosmological tensions. Thus cosmological observations nicely provide independent motivations for the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement in Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to significantly enhance the signal rate in qubit-based dark matter detection experiments with the help of quantum interference. Various quantum sensors possess ideal properties for detecting wave-like dark matter, and qubits, commonly employed in quantum computers, are excellent candidates for dark matter detectors. We demonstrate that, by designing an appropriate quantum circuit to manipulate the qubits, the signal rate scales proportionally to $n_{\rm q}^2$, with $n_{\rm q}$ being the number of sensor qubits, rather than linearly with $n_{\rm q}$. Consequently, in the dark matter detection with a substantial number of sensor qubits, a significant increase in the signal rate can be expected. We provide a specific example of a quantum circuit that achieves this enhancement by coherently combining the phase evolution in each individual qubit due to its interaction with dark matter. We also demonstrate that the circuit is fault tolerant to de-phasing noises, a critical quantum noise source in quantum computers. The enhancement mechanism proposed here is applicable to various modalities for quantum computers, provided that the quantum operations relevant to enhancing the dark matter signal can be applied to these devices.</description>

Abstract: The possible appearance of the effects of local parity breaking in the QCD medium formed in heavy ion collisions due to violation of chiral symmetry can be quantified by corresponding chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. The experimental observables sensitive to the effects of local parity violation in strong interaction include search for polarisation splitting of the $\rho_0$ and $\omega_0$ mesons via angular dependence of spectral functions in their decay to leptons. In this paper we study the space-time evolution and fluctuations of $\mu_5$ using relativistic hydrodynamics and estimate their effect on the light vector meson polarization splitting in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energy.</description>

Abstract: The Jovian magnetic field, being the strongest and largest planetary one in the solar system, could offer us new insights into possible microscopic scale new physics, such as a non-zero mass of the Standard Model (SM) photon or a light dark photon kinetically mixing with the SM photon. We employ the immense data set from the latest Juno mission, which provides us unprecedented information about the magnetic field of the gas giant, together with a more rigorous statistical approach compared to the literature, to set strong constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing parameter, as well as the SM photon mass. The constraint on the dark photon parameters is independent of whether dark photon is (part of) dark matter or not, and serves as the most stringent one in a certain regime of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Collisions and collective flavor conversion: Integrating out the fast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dense astrophysical environments, notably core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, neutrino-neutrino forward scattering can spawn flavor conversion on very short scales. Scattering with the background medium can impact collective flavor conversion in various ways, either damping oscillations or possibly setting off novel collisional flavor instabilities (CFIs). A key feature in this process is the slowness of collisions compared to the much faster dynamics of neutrino-neutrino refraction. Assuming spatial homogeneity, we leverage this hierarchy of scales to simplify the description accounting only for the slow dynamics driven by collisions. We illustrate our new approach both in the case of CFIs and in the case of fast instabilities damped by collisions. In both cases, our strategy provides new equations, the slow-dynamics equations, that simplify the description of flavor conversion and allow us to qualitatively understand the final state of the system after the instability, either collisional or fast, has saturated.</description>

      <title>Are There Correlations in the HAWC and IceCube High Energy Skymaps Outside the Galactic Plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use publicly-available data to perform a search for correlations of high energy neutrino candidate events detected by IceCube and high-energy photons seen by the HAWC collaboration. Our search is focused on unveiling such correlations outside of the Galactic plane. This search is sensitive to correlations in the neutrino candidate and photon skymaps which would arise from a population of unidentified point sources. We find no evidence for such a correlation, but suggest strategies for improvements with new data sets.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Kinetic Equation for Mixed Neutrinos: Tracing the Missing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flavor-dependent neutrino transport is described by a well-known kinetic equation for occupation-number matrices in flavor space. However, as an overlooked theoretical problem, we show that in the inhomogeneous case, neutrino-neutrino refractive energy is not conserved. We derive the missing gradient terms in the fast flavor limit (vanishing neutrino masses), and prove that the missing refractive energy is traded with the huge reservoir of neutrino kinetic energy through gradients of the weak interaction potential. Even small changes of the kinetic energy accommodate the refractive energy gained or lost. Flavor evolution alone is negligibly affected by the new terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Fortran 77/95 code capable of computing QCD corrections in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The code uses the Projection-to-Born method to augment an existing $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ dijet DIS code, thereby obtaining predictions for photon-mediated neutral-current single-jet DIS production in the laboratory frame. The code is lightweight and fast, and yet includes the most common functionalities found in typical perturbative QCD programs, like automatic renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties, options to run and combine multiple seeds, and interfaces to fastjet and LHAPDF. Due to the underlying disent and HOPPET codes, the program also provides stable results in the infrared, relevant for extracting logarithmic coefficients for analytic resummations, and access to the massless DIS structure functions and (reduced) cross sections up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy analysis of ultra-soft pion trap at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtoscopy studies of pion radiation in heavy-ion collisions have been conducted extensively at all available collider energies, both theoretically and experimentally. In all these studies a special interest is given to $m_{T}$ dependency of pion femtoscopy radii, usually approximated by a power-law function at transverse momenta above 200 MeV/$c$. However, the radii behaviour has been much less explored for the ultra-soft pions, possessing the transverse momentum comparable to or lower than the pion mass. For many experimental setups this region is difficult to measure. In this work we present theoretical calculations of pion emission in the ultra-soft region in the two hybrid models -- iHKM and LHYQUID+THERMINATOR2. Along with the particle transverse momentum spectra, we present the calculated femtoscopy radii, both in one-dimensional and three-dimensional representations. We investigate the radii dependence on pair $m_{T}$ and observe, in particular, a departure from the power-law behaviour at ultra-soft momenta, potentially reflecting a decoupling of such slow pions from the rest of collectively expanding system. We provide the theoretical interpretation of this result and discuss its significance, in particular, for the ongoing non-identical particle femtoscopy analysis for pairs consisting of a pion and a baryon (or of a pion and a charmed meson).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe pentaquarks as baryo-charmonia with a color octet $c\bar{c}$ core bonded to a color octet three-quark system. Fermi statistics of the light quark cloud allows to describe two pentaquark triplets: a lower one, well supported by experiment, and a higher one with strangeness. For the time being, the lowest line of the strange triplet has been experimentally identified in a $3\sigma$ peak. Data also suggest (at least) two different production mechanisms for pentaquarks. We show how this can be described in the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two versions of radiative linear seesaw models, where electrically charged scalars and vector-like leptons generate the Dirac neutrino mass submatrix at one and two loop levels. In these models, the SM charged lepton masses are generated from a one loop level radiative seesaw mechanism mediated by charged exotic vector-like leptons and electrically neutral scalars running in the loops. These models can successfully accommodate the current amount of dark matter and baryon asymmetries observed in the Universe, as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>The electric dipole moment in a model for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electric dipole moment is examined in a three-loop neutrino mass model with dark matter originally proposed in Aoki et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 051805 (2009)]. The model contains a $CP$-violating phase in the Higgs potential which plays an important role in electroweak baryogenesis and is thus expected to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously. However, such a $CP$-violating phase is severely constrained by the measurements of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), and a suppression mechanism for the eEDM is necessary to explain the observed baryon asymmetry while avoiding the constraint. In this paper, we examine neutrino mass, lepton-flavor-violating processes, dark matter, and the eEDM in the model. We show that the eEDM can be suppressed by destructive interference between the $CP$-violating phases in the Higgs sector and the dark sector with large $CP$-violating phases. We propose some benchmark scenarios including $O(1)$ $CP$-violating phases where tiny neutrino mass and dark matter can be explained while avoiding all current experimental and theoretical constraints. These $CP$-violating phases are expected to be large enough to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario.</description>

Abstract: To continue from our previous work Phys.Rev.D 109(2024),073007, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable Mathematica notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the single-inclusive production of prompt photons in electron proton collisions, $ep \to \gamma X $, for kinematics relevant at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We perform a perturbative calculation of the differential cross section to next-to-leading order in QCD and to lowest order in QED. We consider unpolarized collisions as well as scattering of longitudinally polarized incident electrons and protons. We show that the cross sections are sensitive to the parton distribution functions of photons inside the proton, which we find to generate the dominant contributions in certain kinematical regions at the EIC. We also investigate the effects of photon isolation on the unpolarized and polarized cross sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is conducted to elucidate their nature, which continues to be the subject of controversy and incomplete understanding in the field. In this study, the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments of the tetraquarks $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ are extracted in the context of a compact diquark-antidiquark configuration with the help of the QCD light-cone rules method. The magnetic dipole moments are given as $\mu_{[sc] [\bar u \bar b]} = -2.12^{+0.74}_{-0.59} \mu_N$, $\mu_{[sc] [\bar d \bar b]} = 1.66^{+0.60}_{-0.46} \mu_N$, and $\mu_{[sc] [\bar s \bar b]} = 2.01^{+0.61}_{-0.50} \mu_N$. The order of magnitude of the magnetic dipole moments would suggest that these outcomes may be achievable in forthcoming experiments. The magnetic and quadrupole moments of hadrons represent another important observable, along with their mass and decay width, which contribute to our understanding of the underlying quark structure and dynamics. Therefore, we hope that the results of this study will prove useful in theoretical and experimental investigations, which we anticipate will be an interesting research topic.</description>

Abstract: In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we delve into the flavor violation of $h \rightarrow bs$, where $h$ is identified with the SM-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. As the U(1) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the U(1)XSSM has new super fields such as right-handed neutrinos and three Higgs singlets. We conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying mechanisms and parameter dependencies of $h \rightarrow bs$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM. In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we discover that the Br$(h \rightarrow bs)$ for the Higgs decay to $bs$ could significantly differ from the expectation in the standard model (SM), depending on the values of the new parameters introduced in the model. Our research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of Higgs physics within the $U(1)_X$SSM, but also provides valuable guidance for new physics (NP).</description>

      <title>Particle production in HRG with thermodynamically consistent EoS and partially deformable hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of centre-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a HRG. It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature and BCP of the HRG system on the centre-of-mass energy in the URHIC. We also find strong evidence of double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies for the set of the model parameters obtaining the best theoretical fit to the experimental data by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$/dof value.</description>

Abstract: In these proceedings, I review recent precision calculations relevant for the LHC, all related to the electroweak, Higgs or top sector of the Standard Model. These applications range from triboson production to the production of a top-antitop pair in association with a W boson and to Higgs production in association with another Higgs boson, a top-antitop pair or a W boson. These proceedings reflect a presentation given at DIS2024 and provide a snapshot of the current frontier for theoretical predictions at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a solvable class of five-dimensional dilaton gravity models that continuously interpolate between anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$), linear dilaton (LD$_5$) and positively curved spacetimes as a function of a continuous parameter $\nu$. The dilaton vacuum expectation value is set by a potential localized on a flat brane. We chart the elementary properties of these backgrounds for any admissible $\nu$, and determine stability conditions of the brane-dilaton system. We find that the spectrum of metric fluctuations can be either continuous or discrete. It features a massless graviton mode confined between the brane and the curvature singularity, and a massive radion mode tied to brane-dilaton stability. We show that, in the presence of a bulk black hole, the holographic theory living on the brane features a perfect fluid. The equation of state of the holographic fluid interpolates between radiation, pressureless matter and vacuum energy as a function of $\nu$. This extends earlier findings on holographic fluids. Our results suggest that the thermodynamics of the fluid mirrors precisely the thermodynamics of the bulk black hole.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>

Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>
