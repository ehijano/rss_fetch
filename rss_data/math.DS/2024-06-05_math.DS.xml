      <title>Input-output reduced order modeling for public health intervention evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, mathematical models have become an indispensable tool in the planning, evaluation, and implementation of public health interventions. Models must often provide detailed information for many levels of population stratification. Such detail comes at a price: in addition to the computational costs, the number of considered input parameters can be large, making effective study design difficult. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel technique to reduce the dimension of the model input space to simplify model-informed intervention planning. The method works by first applying a dimension reduction technique on the model output space. We then develop a method which allows us to map each reduced output to a corresponding vector in the input space, thereby reducing its dimension. We apply the method to the HIV Optimization and Prevention Economics (HOPE) model, to validate the approach and establish proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Entropy density and large deviation principles without upper semi-continuity of entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding Thurston maps were introduced by M. Bonk and D. Meyer with motivation from complex dynamics and Cannon's conjecture from geometric group theory via Sullivan's dictionary. In this paper, we show that the entropy map of an expanding Thurston map is upper semi-continuous if and only if the map has no periodic critical points. For all expanding Thurston maps, even in the presence of periodic critical points, we show that ergodic measures are entropy-dense and establish level-2 large deviation principles for the distribution of Birkhoff averages, periodic points, and iterated preimages. It follows that iterated preimages and periodic points are equidistributed with respect to the unique equilibrium state for an expanding Thurston map and a potential that is H\"older continuous with respect to a visual metric on $S^2$. In particular, our results answer two questions in [Li15].
  The main technical tools in this paper are called subsystems of expanding Thurston maps, inspired by a translation of the notion of subgroups via Sullivan's dictionary.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcation arising from decline of immunity against emerging infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decline of immunity is a phenomenon characterized by immunocompromised host and plays a crucial role in the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose an age-structured model with vaccination and reinfection of immune individuals. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium of the model undergoes backward and forward transcritical bifurcations at the critical value of the basic reproduction number for different values of parameters. We illustrate the results by numerical computations, and also find that the endemic equilibrium exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation on the extended branch of the forward transcritical bifurcation. These results allow us to understand the interplay between the decline of immunity and EIDs, and are able to provide strategies for mitigating the impact of EIDs on global health.</description>

      <title>Data-driven optimal prediction with control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Stability for a family of planar systems with nilpotent critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a family of planar polynomial systems $\dot x = y^{2l-1} - x^{2k+1}, \dot y =-x +m y^{2s+1},$ where $l,k,s\in\mathbb{N^*},$ $2\le l \le 2s$ and $m\in\mathbb{R}.$ We study the center-focus problem on its origin which is a monodromic nilpotent critical point. By directly calculating the generalized Lyapunov constants, we find that the origin is always a focus and we complete the classification of its stability. This includes the most difficult case: $s=kl$ and $m=(2k+1)!!/(2kl+1)!_{(2l)}.$ In this case, we prove that the origin is always unstable. Our result extends and completes a previous one.</description>

      <title>Spatial models for boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that up to a null set, every infinite measure-preserving action of a locally compact Polish group can be turned into a continuous measure-preserving action on a locally compact Polish space where the underlying measure is Radon. We also investigate the distinction between spatial and boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup. We finally obtain a streamlined proof of a recent result of Avraham-Re'em and Roy: Levy groups cannot admit nontrivial continous measure-preserving actions on Polish spaces when the measure is locally finite.</description>

      <title>LongSSM: On the Length Extension of State-space Models in Language Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the length-extension of state-space models (SSMs) in language modeling. Length extension involves training models on short sequences and testing them on longer ones. We show that state-space models trained with zero hidden states initialization have difficulty doing length extension. We explain this difficulty by pointing out the length extension is equivalent to polynomial extrapolation. Based on the theory, we propose a simple yet effective method - changing the hidden states initialization scheme - to improve the length extension. Moreover, our method shows that using long training sequence length is beneficial but not necessary to length extension. Changing the hidden state initialization enables the efficient training of long-memory model with a smaller training context length.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Fractal Dimension as a Measure of Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounding and predicting the generalization gap of overparameterized neural networks remains a central open problem in theoretical machine learning. Neural network optimization trajectories have been proposed to possess fractal structure, leading to bounds and generalization measures based on notions of fractal dimension on these trajectories. Prominently, both the Hausdorff dimension and the persistent homology dimension have been proposed to correlate with generalization gap, thus serving as a measure of generalization. This work performs an extended evaluation of these topological generalization measures. We demonstrate that fractal dimension fails to predict generalization of models trained from poor initializations. We further identify that the $\ell^2$ norm of the final parameter iterate, one of the simplest complexity measures in learning theory, correlates more strongly with the generalization gap than these notions of fractal dimension. Finally, our study reveals the intriguing manifestation of model-wise double descent in persistent homology-based generalization measures. This work lays the ground for a deeper investigation of the causal relationships between fractal geometry, topological data analysis, and neural network optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider homogeneous coupled cell networks with asymmetric inputs. We obtain general results concerning codimension-one steady-state bifurcations for networks with any number of cells and any number of asymmetric inputs. These results rely solely on the network adjacency matrices eigenvalue structure and the existence, or not, of network synchrony subspaces. For networks with three-cells, we describe the possible lattices of synchrony subspaces annotated with the eigenvalues on each synchrony subspace. Applying the previous results, we classify the synchrony-breaking steady-state bifurcations that can occur for three-cell minimal networks with one, two or six asymmetric inputs.</description>

      <title>Sofic mean dimension of typical actions and a comparison theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine two results in the paper entitled "Sofic mean dimension" by Hanfeng Li, improving two inequalities with two equalities, respectively, for sofic mean dimension of typical actions. On the one hand, we study sofic mean dimension of full shifts, for which, Li provided an upper bound which however is not optimal. We prove a more delicate estimate from above, which is optimal for sofic mean dimension of full shifts over arbitrary alphabets (i.e. compact metrizable spaces). Our refinement, together with the techniques (in relation to an estimate from below) in the paper entitled "Mean dimension of full shifts" by Masaki Tsukamoto, eventually allows us to get the exact value of sofic mean dimension of full shifts over any finite dimensional compact metrizable spaces. On the other hand, we investigate finite group actions. In contrast to the case that the acting group is infinite (and amenable), Li showed that if a finite group acts continuously on a finite dimensional compact metrizable space, then sofic mean dimension may be different from (strictly less than) the classical (i.e. amenable) mean dimension (an explicitly known value in this case). We strengthen this result by proving a sharp lower bound, which, combining with the upper bound, gives the exact value of sofic mean dimension for all the actions of finite groups on finite dimensional compact metrizable spaces. Furthermore, this equality leads to a satisfactory comparison theorem for those actions, deciding when sofic mean dimension would coincide with classical mean dimension. Moreover, our two results, in particular, verify for a typical class of sofic group actions that sofic mean dimension does not depend on sofic approximation sequences.</description>

Abstract: For $\lambda\in(0,1/2]$ let $K_\lambda \subset\mathbb{R}$ be a self-similar set generated by the iterated function system $\{\lambda x, \lambda x+1-\lambda\}$. Given $x\in(0,1/2)$, let $\Lambda(x)$ be the set of $\lambda\in(0,1/2]$ such that $x\in K_\lambda$. In this paper we show that $\Lambda(x)$ is a topological Cantor set having zero Lebesgue measure and full Hausdorff dimension. Furthermore, we show that for any $y_1,\ldots, y_p\in(0,1/2)$ there exists a full Hausdorff dimensional set of $\lambda\in(0,1/2]$ such that $y_1,\ldots, y_p \in K_\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A parameter ASIP for the quadratic family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the quadratic family $T_a(x) = a x (1 - x)$, for $x \in [0, 1]$ and mixing Collet--Eckmann (CE) parameters $a \in (2,4)$. For bounded $\varphi$, set $\tilde \varphi_{a} := \varphi - \int \varphi \, d\mu_a$, with $\mu_a$ the unique acim of $T_a$, and put $(\sigma_a (\varphi))^2 := \int \tilde \varphi_{a}^2 \, d\mu_a + 2 \sum_{i&gt;0} \int \tilde \varphi_{a} (\tilde \varphi_{a} \circ T^i_{a}) \, d\mu_a$. For any transversal mixing Misiurewicz parameter $a_*$, we find a positive measure set $\Omega_*$ of mixing CE parameters, containing $a_*$ as a Lebesgue density point, such that for any H\"older $\varphi$ with $\sigma_{a_*}(\varphi)\ne 0$, there exists $\epsilon_\varphi &gt;0$ such that, for normalised Lebesgue measure on $\Omega_*\cap [a_*-\epsilon_\varphi, a_*+\epsilon_\varphi]$, the functions $\xi_i(a)=\tilde \varphi_a(T_a^{i+1}(1/2))/\sigma_a (\varphi)$ satisfy an almost sure invariance principle (ASIP) for any error exponent $\gamma &gt;2/5$. (In particular, the Birkhoff sums satisfy this ASIP.) Our argument goes along the lines of Schnellmann's proof for piecewise expanding maps. We need to introduce a variant of Benedicks-Carleson parameter exclusion and to exploit fractional response and uniform exponential decay of correlations from a previous work of Baladi, Benedicks, and Schnellmann.</description>

      <title>Detection of Approaching Critical Transitions in Natural Systems Driven by Red Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of critical slowing down (CSD) is the dominant avenue for anticipating critical transitions from noisy time-series data. Most commonly, changes in variance and lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)] are used as CSD indicators. However, these indicators will only produce reliable results if the noise driving the system is white and stationary. In the more realistic case of time-correlated red noise, increasing (decreasing) the correlation of the noise will lead to spurious (masked) alarms for both variance and AC(1). Here, we propose two new methods that can discriminate true CSD from possible changes in the driving noise characteristics. We focus on estimating changes in the linear restoring rate based on Langevin-type dynamics driven by either white or red noise. We assess the capacity of our new estimators to anticipate critical transitions and show that they perform significantly better than other existing methods both for continuous-time and discrete-time models. In addition to conceptual models, we apply our methods to climate model simulations of the termination of the African Humid Period. The estimations rule out spurious signals stemming from nonstationary noise characteristics and reveal a destabilization of the African climate system as the dynamical mechanism underlying this archetype of abrupt climate change in the past.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic motions in the $N$-body problem with homogeneous potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $N$-body problem, a motion is called hyperbolic, when the mutual distances between the bodies go to infinity with non-zero limiting velocities as time goes to infinity. For Newtonian potential, in \cite{MV20} Maderna and Venturelli proved that starting from any initial position there is a hyperbolic motion with any prescribed limiting velocities at infinity.
  Recently based on a different approach, Liu, Yan and Zhou \cite{LYZ21} generalized this result to a larger class of $N$-body problem. As the proof in \cite{LYZ21} is quite long and technical, we give a simplified proof for homogeneous potentials following the approach given in the latter paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fire blight is a bacterial plant disease that affects apple and pear trees. We present a mathematical model for its spread in an orchard during bloom. This is a PDE-ODE coupled system, consisting of two semilinear PDEs for the pathogen, coupled to a system of three ODEs for the stationary hosts. Exploratory numerical simulations suggest the existence of travelling waves, which we subsequently prove, under some conditions on parameters, using the method of upper and lower bounds and Schauder's fixed point theorem. Our results are likely not optimal in the sense that our constraints on parameters, which can be interpreted biologically, are sufficient for the existence of travelling waves, but probably not necessary. Possible implications for fire blight biology and management are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Given two coprime integers $p\ge 2$ and $q \ge 3$, let $D_p\subset[0,1)$ consist of all rational numbers which have a finite $p$-ary expansion, and let $$ K(q, \mathcal{A})=\bigg\{ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{d_i}{q^i}: d_i\in \mathcal{A}~ \forall i\in\mathbb{N} \bigg\}, $$ where $\mathcal{A} \subset \{0,1,\ldots, q-1\}$ with cardinality $1&lt;\#\mathcal{A}&lt; q$. In 2021 Schleischitz showed that $\#(D_p\cap K(q,\mathcal{A}))&lt;+\infty$. In this paper we show that for any $r\in\mathbb{Q}$ and for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, $$ \#\big((r D_p+\alpha)\cap K(q,\mathcal{A})\big)&lt;+\infty. $$</description>

      <title>Group actions on orbits of an amenable equivalence relation and topological versions of Kesten's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish results connecting the uniform Liouville property of group actions on the classes of a countable Borel equivalence relation with amenability of this equivalence relation. We also study extensions of Kesten's theorem to certain classes of topological groups and prove a version of this theorem for amenable SIN groups. Furthermore, we discuss relationship between generalizations of Kesten's theorem and anticoncentration inequalities for the inverted orbits of random walks on the classes of an amenable equivalence relation. This allows us to construct an amenable Polish group that does not satisfy the limit conditions in combinatorial extensions of Kesten's theorem.</description>

      <title>Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that it can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize it to: identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nuclear dimension of subhomogeneous twisted groupoid C*-algebras and dynamic asymptotic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise subhomogeneity for twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebras and obtain an upper bound on their nuclear dimension. As an application, we remove the principality assumption in recent results on upper bounds on the nuclear dimension of a twisted \'etale groupoid C*-algebra in terms of the dynamic asymptotic dimension of the groupoid and the covering dimension of its unit space. As a non-principal example, we show that the dynamic asymptotic dimension of any minimal (not necessarily free) action of the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$ on an infinite compact Hausdorff space $X$ is always one. So if we further assume that $X$ is second-countable and has finite covering dimension, then $C(X)\rtimes_r D_\infty$ has finite nuclear dimension and is classifiable by its Elliott invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase mixing for Hamiltonians with trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates of macroscopic quantities generated by the solutions to linear transport equations driven by a general family of Hamiltonians. The associated particle trajectories are all trapped in a compact region of phase-space and feature a non-degenerate elliptic stagnation point. The analysis covers a large class of Hamiltonians generated by the radially symmetric compactly supported equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system. Working in radial symmetry, our analysis features both the 1+2-dimensional case and the harder 1+1-dimensional case, where all the particles have the same value of the modulus of angular momentum. The latter case is also of importance in both the plasma physics case and two dimensional incompressible fluid flows.</description>

      <title>How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</description>
