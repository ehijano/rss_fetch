      <title>Five Parameter Hypergeometric 3F2(1) when One or more Parameters are Integers or Separated by Integers: Derivations, Review, Exotics and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work was intended to be all about, and only about, hypergeometric 3F2(1). The initial goal was to revisit many identities from the literature that have been derived over the years and show that they can be obtained in a simpler way armed, with only a minimum of elementary identities. That goal has been achieved as a (patient) reader will discover. In another sense, this work is a partial review of the last half-century's worth of progress in the evaluation of a particular set of 3F2(1), in particular those cases where at least one parameter is an integer or two or more parameters are separated by an integer. The result is a collection of very general identities (or techniques) that an analyst seeking to evaluate a particular 3F2(1), might want to consider as a starting point. That is the secondary goal.
  Along the way however, the temptation arose to investigate at least one of the unanswered questions that others have raised. This led to a few digressions, and some possibly new results. The reader is invited to follow where curiosity led me to depart from a straightforward review of the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Neumann series of Bessel functions for the solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form and related boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions representation for solutions of the Sturm--Liouville equation in impedance form \[ (\kappa(x)u')' + \lambda \kappa(x)u = 0,\quad 0 &lt; x &lt; L, \] in the case where $\kappa \in W^{1,2}(0,L)$ and has no zeros on the interval of interest. The $x$-dependent coefficients of this representation can be constructed explicitly by means of a simple recursive integration procedure. Moreover, we derive bounds for the truncation error, which are uniform whenever the spectral parameter $\rho=\sqrt{\lambda}$ satisfies a condition of the form $|\operatorname{Im}\rho|\leq C$. Based on these representations, we develop a numerical method for solving spectral problems that enables the computation of eigenvalues with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Szeg\H{o} Mapping and Hermite--Pad\'{e} Polynomials for Multiple Orthogonality on the Unit Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generalized Laurent multiple orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle satisfying simultaneous orthogonality conditions with respect to $r$ probability measures or linear functionals on the unit circle. We show that these polynomials can be characterized as solutions of a general two-point Hermite--Pad\'e approximation problem.
  We derive Szeg\H{o}-type recurrence relations, establish compatibility conditions for the associated recurrence coefficients, and obtain Christoffel--Darboux formulas as well as Heine-type determinantal representations.
  Furthermore, by extending the Szeg\H{o} mapping and the Geronimus relations, we relate these Laurent multiple orthogonal polynomials to multiple orthogonal polynomials on the real line, thereby making explicit the connection between multiple orthogonality on the unit circle and on the real line.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Hermite expansions in modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give an elementary proof that Hermite expensions of a function $f$ in the modulation space $M^p(R)$ converges to $f$ in $M^p(R)$ when $1&lt; p&lt;+\infty$ and may diverge when $p = 1,\infty$. The result was previously established for $1&lt; p&lt;+\infty$ by Garling and Wojtaszczyk and for $p = 1,\infty$ by Lusky in an equivalent setting of Fock spaces by different methods. Higher dimesional results are also considered. In an appendix, we also establish upper bounds for the Zak transform of Hermite functions.</description>

      <title>The local Dirichlet integral and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local Dirichlet integral of distance functions and their behavior within the harmonic Dirichlet space. We provide estimates for the local Dirichlet integral of distance functions, which allow us to study their membership in the algebra of multipliers of the Dirichlet space. We give sufficient condition for a closed subset of the unit circle to be polar and we also examine cyclicity in the harmonic Dirichlet spaces.</description>

      <title>The Kato square root estimate with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kato square root estimate for second-order divergence form elliptic operators $-div(A\nabla)$ on a bounded, locally uniform domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, for accretive coefficients $A \in L^\infty(D; \mathbb{C}^n)$, under the Robin boundary condition $\nu \cdot A\nabla u + bu = 0$ for a (possibly unbounded) boundary conductivity $b$. In contrast to essentially all previous estimates of Kato square root operators, no first-order approach seems possible for the Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Rigorous numerical computation of the Stokes multipliers for linear differential equations with single level one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical algorithm for computing the Stokes multipliers of a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients at an irregular singular point of single level one. The algorithm follows a classical approach based on Borel summation and numerical ODE solving, but avoids a large amount of redundant work compared to a direct implementation. It applies to differential equations of arbitrary order, with no genericity assumption, and is suited to high-precision computations. In addition, we present an open-source implementation of this algorithm in the SageMath computer algebra system and illustrate its use with several examples. Our implementation supports arbitrary-precision computations and automatically provides rigorous error bounds. The article assumes minimal prior knowledge of the asymptotic theory of meromorphic differential equations and provides an elementary introduction to the linear Stokes phenomenon that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dick and Liz Askey's visit to U.S.S.R. in 1987, and how the discrete Askey scheme also originated in Russia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes how the discrete Askey scheme independently arose in Russia and how Askey learned about this. In particular, Askey met main characters in this story, namely Gel'fand and Suslov as well as Nikiforov and Uvarov, during his trip to U.S.S.R, in September 1987. The paper describes this trip in some detail, in particular based on the diary of Askey's wife Liz, who accompanied him. Dick and Liz Askey continued their trip by visits to Japan, Australia and India. Schedules of these three visits are also given.</description>

      <title>Non-linear parabolic PDEs with rough data and coefficients: existence, uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions in critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the well-posedness of weak solutions to non-linear parabolic PDEs driven by rough coefficients with rough initial data in critical homogeneous Besov spaces. Well-posedness is understood in the sense of existence and uniqueness of maximal weak solutions in suitable weighted $Z$-spaces in the absence of smallness conditions. We showcase our theory with an application to rough reaction--diffusion equations. Subsequent articles will treat further classes of equations, including equations of Burgers-type and quasi-linear problems, using the same approach. Our toolkit includes a novel theory of hypercontractive singular integral operators (SIOs) on weighted $Z$-spaces and a self-improving property for super-linear reverse H\"older inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels, such as linear viscoelastic models; equations with positive definite kernels, such as partially observed quantum systems; difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how 'interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis, and makes progress on an open question of Abel regarding the solution of integral equations of the first kind. Finally, it reduces simple Volterra equations of all classes to pen-and-paper calculation, and offers promising applications to the numerical solution of Volterra equations more broadly.</description>

      <title>Zero distribution of multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of the $n$-th Hermite polynomial converges to the semicircular law (the free normal distribution), while the zero distribution of the associated Laguerre polynomials converges to the Marchenko--Pastur law (the free Poisson distribution). In this paper, we establish multiplicative analogues of these results. We define the multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials by \begin{align*} H_n^*(x;s) &amp;:= e^{-\frac 12 s ((x\partial_x)^2 - n x \partial_x) } (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj e^{-\frac 12 s (j^2 - nj)} x^j, \\ L_n^*(x; b,c) &amp;:= (x\partial_x + b)^c (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj (j+b)^c x^j, \end{align*} where $n\in \mathbb N_0$, $\partial_x$ denotes the differentiation operator w.r.t. $x$, and $s\in \mathbb R$, $b\in \mathbb C$, $c\in \mathbb N_0$ are parameters. In the Hermite case, we show that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of $H_n^*(x;s/n)$ converges weakly to the free multiplicative normal distribution on the positive half-line (when $s&gt;0$) or to the free unitary normal distribution on the unit circle $\{|z| = 1\}$ (when $s&lt;0$). In the Laguerre case, we show that the zero distribution of $L_n^*(x; n\beta, \lfloor n \gamma \rfloor)$ converges to the free multiplicative Poisson distribution on the positive half-line (when $\gamma &gt;0$ and $\beta \in \mathbb R\backslash[0,1]$) or on the unit circle (when $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\beta \in -\frac 12 + \sqrt{-1} \, \mathbb R$). All these results are obtained by essentially the same method, which treats the Hermite/Laguerre cases and the unitary/positive settings in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Rademacher's Theorem for Calderon-Zygmund-type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rademacher's Theorem can be interpreted as an almost-everywhere \emph{little-$o$ improvement principle}: if a function admits a uniform pointwise first-order Lipschitz control at every point, then this control improves to a vanishing one at almost every point. In the language of Calder\'on--Zygmund pointwise spaces, this means that \[ f \in T^\infty_1(x) \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad f \in t^\infty_1(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in \mathbb{R}^d. \]
  The purpose of this paper is to establish an analogous almost-everywhere improvement principle in a refined $L^p$ setting. We consider pointwise Calder\'on-Zygmund spaces $T^p_{\phi}(x)$ defined via polynomial approximation in $L^p$ with a function parameter $\phi$, allowing for fractional regularity indices and logarithmic corrections through Boyd functions. We prove that, under natural assumptions on $\phi$, the uniform membership \[ f \in T^p_{\phi}(x) \quad \forall x \in E \] on a measurable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ implies an almost-everywhere improvement to a vanishing approximation rate, namely \[ f \in t^p_{\phi,n+1}(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in E, \] where $n &lt; \underline{b}(\phi) \leq \overline{b}(\phi) &lt; n+1$.
  The proof combines measurability arguments, a generalized Whitney extension theorem, and fine properties of Sobolev spaces. We also show that this result is essentially sharp: in general, one cannot expect almost-everywhere membership in $t^p_{\phi,n}(x)$ for fractional indices, and explicit counterexamples are provided.</description>
