      <title>Novel magnetic-field-free switching behavior in vdW-magnet/oxide heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.</description>

      <title>Fate of gapless edge states in two-dimensional topological insulators with Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states are the highlight feature of an interface between non-equivalent insulators. The robustness/sensitivity of these states to local single-particle perturbations is well understood, while their stability in the presence of various types of two-particle interactions remains unclear. To add to previous discussions of the Hubbard and unscreened Coulomb interactions, we address this problem from the point of view of infinite-range Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Based on our numerical results for two models of Chern insulators, the Kane-Mele and spinful Haldane model, on a ribbon geometry with zig-zag edges, we argue that any finite interaction strength $U$ is sufficient to open a charge gap in the spectrum of either Chern insulator. We explain the differences between the two cases and present how their edge states phase out as the system enters the strongly correlated phase. We show that the closing of the many-body gap in periodic variants of these models can be connected to the onset of hybridization between the edge and bulk modes in finite geometries. Providing an example of the bulk-boundary correspondence in systems where there is a topological phase transition without closing of the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>
