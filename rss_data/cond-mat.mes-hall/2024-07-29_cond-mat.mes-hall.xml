      <title>Quantum Hall Edges Beyond the Plasma Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the plasma analogy is generally unreliable at predicting the edge properties of quantum Hall (QH) states, as it fails to account for the local edge velocity. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between QH droplets and Coulomb gases (CGs): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. We illustrate this QH/CG mismatch across various examples and show its impact on physical quantities, measurable in both solid-state samples and quantum simulators. Specifically, we discuss fluctuations of local observables and their connection to state-of-the-art microwave absorption experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of lattice relaxation on electronic spectra of helically twisted trilayer graphene: Large-scale atomistic simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted trilayer graphene hosts two moir\'e superlattices originating from two interfaces between graphene layers. However, the system is generally unstable to lattice relaxation at small twist angles and is expected to show a significantly modified electronic band structure. In particular, a helical trilayer graphene - whose two twisted angles have the same sign - provides an attractive platform with a flat band isolated by large energy gaps near the magic angle, but the interplay between the lattice and the electronic degrees of freedom is not well understood. Here, we performed a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation to study the lattice relaxation of helical trilayer graphenes and evaluated their electronic spectra with a tight-binding model calculation. The comparison of the electronic spectra both with and without the lattice relaxation reveals how the lattice relaxation significantly modifies the electronic spectra particularly near the charge neutrality point. We also investigated the local density of states to visualize the spatially-varying electronic spectra that accords with domain patterns of moir\'e lattice stackings. We propose these characteristic spectral features in the electronic degrees of freedom of a relaxed helical trilayer graphene to be confirmed by scanning probe techniques, such as scanning single-electron transistors and scanning tunneling microscopes.</description>

      <title>Collective optical properties of moir\'e excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Strain engineering in Ge/GeSi spin qubits heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy-holes in Ge/GeSi heterostructures show highly anisotropic gyromagnetic response with in-plane $g$-factors $g_{x,y}^*\lesssim 0.3$ and out-of-plane $g$-factor $g_z^*\gtrsim 10$. As a consequence, Rabi hot spots and dephasing sweet lines are extremely sharp and call for a careful alignment of the magnetic field in Ge spin qubit devices. We investigate how the $g$-factors can be engineered by strains. We show that uniaxial strains can raise in-plane $g$-factors above unity while leaving $g_z^*$ essentially constant. We discuss how the etching of an elongated mesa in a strained buffer can actually induce uniaxial (but inhomogeneous) strains in the heterostructure. This broadens the operational magnetic field range and enables spin manipulation by shuttling holes between neighboring dots with different $g$-factors.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spin superconductor state in ABCA-stacked tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a spontaneous spin superconductor (SC) state in ABCA-stacked tetralayer graphene, under sequential effects of electron-electron (e-e) and electron-hole (e-h) interactions. First of all, we examine the ferromagnetic (FM) exchange instability and phase diagram of the system induced by the long-range e-e interaction. At non- or low-doping levels, the interaction trends to stabilize a FM phase with the coexisting electron and hole carriers. Superior to bilayer and trilayer systems, tetralayer graphene has a larger FM phase region and spin splitting, making it more advantageous to realize the spin SC state. Subsequently, we prove that the FM phase becomes unstable when attractive e-h interaction is considered. As a consequence, the spin SC state can be spontaneously formed at low temperature, where spin-triplet exciton pairs act as the equivalent of Cooper pairs. We further develop a consistent BCS-type theory for the spin SC state in ABCA-stacked graphene. The predicted spin superconducting gap can reach about $7.0$ meV, with a critical temperature of about 45 K for non-doping system. At last, we demonstrated a spin-current Josephson effect in the ABCA-stacked graphene spin SC heterojunction. Our findings enrich the prospective spin SC candidate materials, illuminating more possibilities for achieving non-dissipative super-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Domain-Wall Ferroelectric Polarons in a two-dimensional Rotor Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Double-quantum-dot Andreev molecules: Phase diagrams and critical evaluation of effective models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the phase diagram of a parallel double-quantum-dot Andreev molecule, where the two quantum dots are coupled to a common superconducting lead. Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Bootstrapping of Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage-controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global state configuration in under 8 minutes with a success rate of 96 %. Importantly, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.</description>

      <title>Temperature mediated back-action in micro- and nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermally induced back-action effects in absorption-sensitive micro- and nanomechanical resonators. We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a confined sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</description>

      <title>Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpi\'nski gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpi\'nski gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Extreme time extrapolation capabilities and thermodynamic consistency of physics-inspired Neural Networks for the 3D microstructure evolution of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can closely reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to late coarsening stages, providing an example of a data-driven, physically consistent and high-accuracy Machine Learning method for the long timescale simulation of materials.</description>

      <title>Nanowrinkle Waveguide in Graphene for Enabling Secure Dirac Fermion Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized states in graphene have garnered significant attention in quantum information science due to their potential applications. Despite graphene's superior transport and electronic properties compared to other semiconductors, achieving nanoscale confinement remains challenging due to its gapless nature. In this study, we explore the unique transport properties along nanowrinkles in monolayer graphene. We demonstrate the creation of a one-dimensional conduction channel by alternating pseudo-magnetic fields along the nanowrinkle, enabling ballistic Dirac fermion transport without leakage. This suggests a feasible method for secure quantum information transfer over long distances. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to bent nanowrinkles, showcasing well-guided Dirac fermion propagation unless the bent angle is sufficiently large. Our demonstration of the nanowrinkle waveguide in graphene introduces a novel approach to controlling Dirac fermion transport through strain engineering, for quantum information technology applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using atomistic simulations, we show that new types of skyrmion states called skyrmion molecular crystals and skyrmion superlattices can be realized on triangular substrates when there are two or three skyrmions per substrate minimum. We find that as a function of the magnetic field and substrate periodicity, a remarkably wide variety of ordered phases appear similar to those found in colloidal or Wigner molecular crystals, including ferromagnetic and herringbone states. The ability of the skyrmions to annihilate, deform, and change size gives rise to a variety of superlattice states in which a mixture of different skyrmion sizes and shapes produces bipartate or more complex lattice structures. Our results are relevant for skyrmions on structured triangular substrates, in magnetic arrays, or skyrmions in moire materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersing a mobile impurity in a quantum many-body environment can reveal fundamental properties of the background medium, hence providing a powerful probe of quantum matter. This approach is particularly intriguing when considering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases and topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a mobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of topological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized by an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group velocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile impurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective one-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the chiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting tensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on the edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe exotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>On The Effect Of Size On The Kinetics Of Reactions In Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactions in solution require "contact" between the reagents. We can predict the rate at which reagents come into "contact" (at least in dilute conditions), but if the initial collision does not lead to reaction, what happens then? The collision rates in solution-phase reactions are generally described (explicitly or implicitly) with the Smoluchowski equation. Unfortunately, that model describes coagulations in gases, not reactions in solutions. The model is memory-less, i.e., collisions are treated as random processes, unaware of each other in space and time. The reality is that unreactive collisions create memory: particles (even molecules) "remember" they just collided, i.e, the probability of collision depends on how far back in time their prior collision happened. As we show here, this purely geometric and statistical fact is valid as long as their size is larger than the Kuhn length of their Brownian motion in solution. Under these conditions, particles in solution form, even in the absence of attractive interactions, relatively long-lived "clusters" kept together by the statistical unlikeliness of separating. We show here through Brownian dynamics simulations that, as a result of this memory, the collision rates and the lifetimes of these clusters, differently from what predicted by Smoluchowski's model, are proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colliders and the Kuhn length of their path in solution, with a coefficient close to unity!</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition in Quasi-One-Dimensional Bismuth Iodide Bi4I4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of topological quantum materials and topological phase transitions is at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. Quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) bismuth iodide Bi4I4 exhibits versatile topological phases of matter including weak topological insulator (WTI) and higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) phases with high tunability in response to external parameters. In this work, performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution (micro-ARPES), we comprehensively investigate the fine electronic structure and topological phase transition of Bi4I4. Our examination of the low-temperature {\alpha}-phase reveals the presence of an energy gap on the (100) surface, providing spectroscopic evidence for the HOTI phase. Conversely, the high-temperature {\beta}-Bi4I4 harbors a gapless Dirac fermion on the (100) surface alongside gapped states on the (001) surface, thereby establishing a WTI phase. By tracking the temperature evolution of the (100) surface states, we unveil a thermal hysteresis of the surface gap in line with the {\alpha}-{\beta} structural phase transition. Our findings elucidate the topological properties of Bi4I4 and directly evidence a temperature-induced topological phase transition from WTI to HOTI, which paves the way to potential applications based on the room-temperature topological phase transition in the quasi-1D topological quantum material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson response of a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. We show that the critical Josephson current across the junction oscillates as the altermagnetic field strength increases. The current-phase relation can be forward- or backward-skewed due to significant second-order Josephson response. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. We discover that the skewness can be manipulated by electric gating. We reveal two additional impacts of external fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current.</description>

      <title>General theory of cavity-mediated interactions between low-energy matter excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of low-energy matter properties such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity via cavity quantum electrodynamics engineering has been suggested as a way to enhance these many-body collective phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effective interactions between low-energy matter excitations induced by the off-resonant coupling with cavity electromagnetic modes. We extend previous work by going beyond the dipole approximation accounting for the full polarization and magnetization densities of matter. We further include the often neglected diamagnetic interaction and, for the cavity, we consider general linear absorbing media with possibly non-local and non-reciprocal response. We demonstrate that, even in this general scenario, the effective cavity-induced interactions between the matter degrees of freedom are of electrostatic and magnetostatic nature. This confirms the necessity of a multimode description for cavity engineering of matter systems where the low-energy assumption holds. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for studying the influence of general optical environments on extended low-energy matter excitations.</description>

      <title>Giant Purcell broadening and Lamb shift for DNA-assembled near-infrared quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the light emitted by individual molecules is instrumental to a number of novel nanotechnologies ranging from super-resolution bio-imaging and molecular sensing to quantum nanophotonics. Molecular emission can be tailored by modifying the local photonic environment, for example by precisely placing a single molecule inside a plasmonic nanocavity with the help of DNA origami. Here, using this scalable approach, we show that commercial fluorophores experience giant Purcell factors and Lamb shifts, reaching values on par with those recently reported in scanning tip experiments. Engineering of plasmonic modes enables cavity-mediated fluorescence far detuned from the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) - at detunings that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than the fluorescence linewidth of the bare emitter and reach into the near-infrared. Our results evidence a regime where the emission linewidth is dominated by the excited state lifetime, as required for indistinguishable photon emission, baring relevance to the development of nanoscale, ultrafast quantum light sources and to the quest toward single-molecule cavity-QED. In the future, this approach may also allow to design efficient quantum emitters at infrared wavelengths, where standard organic sources have a reduced performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy with multi-qubit sensors offers the potential to improve imaging speed and measure previously inaccessible quantities, such as two-point correlations. We develop a multiplexed quantum sensing approach with scanning probes containing two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the tip apex. A shared optical channel is used for simultaneous qubit initialization and readout, while phase- and frequency-dependent microwave spin manipulations are leveraged for de-multiplexing the optical readout signal. Scanning dual-NV magnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field projections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point covariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying wire. Our multiplex framework establishes a method to investigate a variety of spatio-temporal correlations, including phase transitions and electronic noise, with nanoscale resolution.</description>

      <title>Giant anisotropic magnetoresistance in few-layer {\alpha}-RuCl3 tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3 is proximate to the coveted quantum spin liquid (QSL) predicted by the Kitaev model. In the search for the pure Kitaev QSL, reducing the dimensionality of this frustrated magnet by exfoliation has been proposed as a way to enhance magnetic fluctuations and Kitaev interactions. Here, we perform angle-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measurements on ultrathin $\alpha$-RuCl3 crystals with various layer numbers to probe their magnetic, electronic and crystal structure. We observe a giant change in resistance - as large as ~2500% - when the magnetic field rotates either within or out of the $\alpha$-RuCl3 plane, a manifestation of the strongly anisotropic spin interactions in this material. In combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy, this tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) reveals that few-layer $\alpha$-RuCl3 crystals remain in the high-temperature monoclinic phase at low temperature. It also shows the presence of a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below the critical temperature TN ~ 14 K, which is twice the one typically observed in bulk samples with rhombohedral stacking. Our work offers valuable insights into the relation between the stacking order and magnetic properties of this material, which helps lay the groundwork for creating and electrically probing exotic magnetic phases like QSLs via van der Waals engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interacting spin system is a great testbed for fundamental quantum physics and applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. For these investigations, detailed information of the interactions, e.g. the number of spins and their interaction strengths, is often required. In this study, we present the identification and characterization of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two electron spins. In the experiment, we first identify a well isolated single NV center, and characterize its spin decoherence time. Then we perform NV-detected electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect surrounding electron spins. From the analysis of the NV-EPR signal, we determine the number of detected spins and their interaction strengths precisely. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates candidates of the detected spins to be diamond surface spins. This study demonstrates a promising approach for the identification and characterization of an interacting spin system for realizing entangled sensing, using the electron spin as quantum reporters.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spans diverse fields from biology to quantum science. Employing NMR on a floating object could unveil novel possibilities beyond conventional operational paradigms. Here, we observe Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) within a levitating micro-diamond using the nuclear spins of nitrogen-14 atoms. By tightly confining the angular degrees of freedom of the diamond in a Paul trap, we achieve efficient hyperfine interaction between optically polarized electronic spins of nitrogen-vacancy centers and the $^{14}$N nuclear spin, enabling nuclear spin polarization and quantum state read-out revealing coherence times up to hundreds of microseconds. This represents the longest recorded spin coherence time in a levitated system, surpassing previous records by three orders of magnitude. Our results offer promise for various applications, including cooling macroscopic particles to their motional ground state and exploring geometric phases for gyroscopy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous symmetry protected blockade of skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), an anomalous localization behavior of the bulk states, is an inherently non-Hermitian phenomenon, which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, the fragility of NHSE has been revealed recently, such as the boundary sensitivity, and it stimulates a lot of studies on discussing the fate of that. Here we present a theorem which shows that the combined spatial reflection symmetry can be considered as a criterion in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems to determine whether the NHSE can exist or not. Distinct from previous studies, our proposed criterion only relies on analyzing the symmetry of the system, freeing out other requirements, such as the information of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, by taking the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain as an example, we verify our theorem through both a mathematical proof via the non-Bloch band theory and the exact diagonalization numerical studies. Our results reveal a profound connection between the symmetry and the fate of NHSE.</description>

Abstract: The generation of $S=1$ triplet Cooper pairs has been predicted theoretically in superconducting-ferromagnetic hybrid heterostructures in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we experimentally investigate vertical Josephson junctions where the weak link is formed from a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy sandwiched by two non-magnetic layers with weak or strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that the decay of the Josephson coupling is reduced in the latter case, possibly indicating the presence of $S=1$ spin-triplet correlations. We speculate that the canted magnetization required for these correlations is provided by the interaction of magnetization with Meissner effect in the superconducting layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We report lasing of moir\'e trapped interlayer excitons (IXs) by integrating a pristine hBN-encapsulated MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer into a high-$Q$ ($&gt;10^4$) nanophotonic cavity. We control the cavity-IX detuning using a magnetic field and measure their dipolar coupling strength to be $78 \pm 4\ \mathrm{\mu eV}$, fully consistent with the 82 $\mathrm{\mu eV}$ predicted by theory. The emission from the cavity mode shows clear threshold-like behavior as the transition is tuned into resonance with the cavity. We observe a superlinear power dependence accompanied by a narrowing of the linewidth as the distinct features of lasing. The onset and prominence of these threshold-like behaviors are pronounced at resonance while weak off-resonance. Our results show that a lasing transition can be induced in interacting moir\'e IXs with macroscopic coherence extending over the length scale of the cavity mode. Such systems raise interesting perspectives for low-power switching and synaptic nanophotonic devices using two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how topological Chern numbers can be defined when single-particle states hybridize with continua. We do so exemplarily in a bosonic Haldane model at zero temperature with an additional on-site decay of one boson into two and the conjugate fusion of two bosons into one. Restricting the Hilbert space to two bosons at maximum, the exact self-energy is accessible. We use the bilinear Hamiltonian $H_0$ corrected by the self-energy $\Sigma$ to compute Chern numbers by two different approaches. The results are gauged against a full many-body calculation in the Hilbert space where possible. We establish numerically and analytically that the effective Hamiltonian $H_\text{eff}=H_0(\vec k) +\Sigma(\omega,\vec k)$ reproduces the correct many-body topology if the considered band does not overlap with the continuum. In case of overlaps, one can extend the definition of the Chern number to the non-Hermitian $H_\text{eff}$ and there is evidence that the Chern number changes at exceptional points. But the bulk-boundary correspondence appears to be no longer valid and edge modes delocalize.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction Utilizing the Topological Faraday Effect of Topological Insulator Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. So far, the transduction efficiency $\eta$ via the magneto-optic Faraday effect (i.e., the light-magnon interaction) in the ferromagnet YIG has been demonstrated to be small as $\eta\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{-} 10^{-15}$ due to the weak magneto-optic coupling. Here, we take advantage of the fact that three-dimensional topological insulator thin films exhibit a topological Faraday effect that is independent of the sample thickness in the terahertz regime. This leads to a large Faraday rotation angle and therefore enhanced light-magnon interaction in the thin film limit. We show theoretically that the transduction efficiency between microwave and terahertz photons can be greatly improved to $\eta\sim10^{-4}$ by utilizing the heterostructures consisting of topological insulator thin films such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and ferromagnetic insulator thin films such as YIG.</description>

Abstract: We present a phenomenological theory of altermagnets, that captures their unique magnetization dynamics and allows modelling magnetic textures in this new magnetic phase. Focusing on the prototypical d-wave altermagnets, e.g. RuO$_2$, we can explain intuitively the characteristic lifted degeneracy of their magnon spectra, by the emergence of an effective sublattice-dependent anisotropic spin stiffness arising naturally from the phenomenological theory. We show that as a consequence the altermagnetic domain walls, in contrast to antiferromagnets, have a finite gradient of the magnetization, with its strength and gradient direction connected to the altermagnetic anisotropy, even for 180$^\circ$ domain walls. This gradient generates a ponderomotive force in the domain wall in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous external magnetic field, which may be achieved through magnetic force microscopy techniques. The motion of these altermagentic domain walls is also characterized by an anisotropic Walker breakdown, with much higher speed limits of propagation than ferromagnets but lower than antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>Bulk-entanglement spectrum correspondence in $PT$- and $PC$-symmetric topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence which holds for topological insulators and superconductors when the parity-time ($PT$) and/or parity-particle-hole ($PC$) symmetry are present. In these systems, even when the bulk topology is nontrivial, the edge spectrum is generally gapped, and thus the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold. We find that, instead of the edge spectrum, the single-particle entanglement spectrum becomes gapless when the bulk topology is nontrivial: i.e., the $\textit{bulk-entanglement}$ $\textit{spectrum}$ $\textit{correspondence}$ holds in $PT$- and/or $PC$-symmetric topological insulators and superconductors. After showing the correspondence using $K$-theoretic approach, we provide concrete models for each symmetry class up to three dimensions where nontrivial topology due to $PT$ and/or $PC$ is expected. An implication of our results is that, when the bulk topology under $PT$ and/or $PC$ symmetry is nontrivial, the non-interacting many-body entanglement spectrum is multiply degenerate in one dimension and is gapless in two or higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic perturbation approach to moir\'e bands in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a diagrammatic perturbation theory to account for the emergence of moir\'e bands in the continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene. Our framework is build upon treating the moir\'e potential as a perturbation that transfers electrons from one layer to another through the exchange of the three wave vectors that define the moir\'e Brillouin zone. By working in the two-band basis of each monolayer, we analyze the one-particle Green's function and introduce a diagrammatic representation for the scattering processes. We then identify the moir\'e-induced self-energy, relate it to the quasiparticle weight and velocity of the moir\'e bands, and show how it can be obtained by summing irreducible diagrams. We also connect the emergence of flat bands to the behavior of the static self-energy at the magic angle. In particular, we show that a vanishing Dirac velocity is a direct consequence of the relative orientation of the momentum transfer vectors, suggesting that the origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene is intrinsically connected to its geometrical properties. Our approach provides a diagrammatic framework that highlights the physical properties of the moir\'e bands.</description>

      <title>AC conductivity and magnetic dichroism of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum dot junctions capacitively coupled to a resonator, electron tunneling through the quantum dot can be used to transfer heat between different parts of the system. This includes cooling or heating the electrons in electrodes and absorbing or emitting photons in the resonator mode. Such systems can be driven into a nonequilibrium state by applying either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient across the electrodes coupled to the quantum dot, or by employing an external coherent pump to excite the resonator. In this study, we present a semiclassical theory to describe the steady state of these structures. We employ a combination of the Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's functions method and semiclassical laser theory to analyze a normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor junction coupled to a resonator. Our investigation focuses on key parameters such as the average photon number and phase shift in the resonator, the charge current in the quantum dot, and the heat fluxes among different components of the system. We explore how photon-assisted Andreev reflection and quasiparticle tunneling in the quantum dot can refrigerate the resonator mode and the normal metal electrode. We also examine the influence of finite voltage and thermal biases on these processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mean-field phase diagram of electrons in a kagome flat band with repulsive interactions. In addition to flat-band ferromagnetism, the Hartree-Fock analysis yields cascades of unconventional magnetic orders driven by onsite repulsion as filling changes. These include a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-charge stripe orders, as well as an evolution from $120^\circ$AFM to intriguing noncoplanar spin orders with tetrahedral structures. We also map out the phase diagram under extended repulsion at half and empty fillings of the flat band. To examine the possibilities beyond the mean-field level, we conduct a projective symmetry group analysis and identify the feasible $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquids and the magnetic orders derivable from them. The theoretical phase diagrams are compared with recent experiments on FeSn and FeGe, enabling a determination of the most likely magnetic instabilities in these and similar flat-band kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Accounting for localized deformation: a simple computation of true stress in micropillar compression experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compression experiments are widely used to study the mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nanoscale. However, the conventional engineering stress measurement method used in these experiments neglects to account for the alterations in the material's shape during loading. This can lead to inaccurate stress values and potentially misleading conclusions about the material's mechanical behavior especially in the case of localized deformation. To address this issue, we present a method for calculating true stress in cases of localized plastic deformation commonly encountered in experimental settings: (i) a single band and (ii) two bands oriented in arbitrary directions with respect to the vertical axis of the pillar (either in the same or opposite directions). Our simple analytic formulas can be applied to homogeneous and isotropic materials and crystals, requiring only standard data (displacement-force curve, aspect ratio, shear band angle and elastic strain limit) obtained from experimental results and eliminating the need for finite element computations. Our approach provides a more precise interpretation of experimental results and can serve as a valuable and simple tool in material design and characterization.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eventual presence of the diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarizes the principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds from meteorites. The size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects have never been observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of the silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds opens the possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Study of Topological Phenomena Through Berry Phase in Classical Nonlinear Elastic Granules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric of Berry phase concept, traditionally rooted in quantum mechanics, has been found to be increasingly significant in classical mechanics, particularly for understanding the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. In this study, we demonstrate the controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a classical system using a two-level time-dependent elastic bit, analogous to a quantum bit, within a nonlinear environment generated by a two-granular network. The nonlinearity of the granular beads is modulated through the frequency and amplitude of external harmonic excitation, along with static preloading. By employing the orthonormal basis of the nonlinear responses and mapping the displacement coefficients in Bloch states, we reveal how time influences the manipulation of the elastic bit and its states. Our analytical and experimental investigations uncover the Berry phase's role in exposing the various topological characteristics of the classical granular network. This research establishes a crucial link between classical and quantum realms via the Berry phase of an elastic bit, with significant implications for decoherence-free and robust data transfer and information processing.</description>
