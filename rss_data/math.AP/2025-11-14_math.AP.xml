      <title>Euler equation on a fast rotating ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the analytical study of the incompressible Euler equations from the classical spherical setting to the more realistic geometry of a biaxial ellipsoid. Motivated by the work of Cheng and Mahalov on fast rotating spheres and Xu on Rossby-Haurwitz solutions on ellipsoids, we adapt their framework to establish a parallel result for Euler flows on a rotating ellipsoidal surface. In the regime of rapid rotation, we prove that the time-averaged velocity field remains uniformly bounded in Sobolev norms independent of the rotation rate and converges to a longitude-independent zonal flow depending only on latitude. This shows that the zonalization phenomenon discovered by Cheng and Mahalov on the sphere persists on biaxial ellipsoids, thereby bridging the gap between spherical and ellipsoidal theories of fast rotating Euler dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Rankine Vortex and Perimeter Growth in Vortex Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $\omega: \mathbb{R}^2 \to [0,1]$ sharing the same total vorticity and center of vorticity as the Rankine vortex, the $L^1$ deviation from the Rankine patch can be bounded by a function of the pseudo-energy deviation and the angular momentum of $\omega$. In the case of $m-$fold symmetry, the dependence on the angular momentum can be dropped. Using this, we affirm the results of prior simulations by demonstrating linear in time perimeter growth for a simply connected perturbation of the Rankine vortex.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the adhesion model and the reconstruction problem in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmology, a basic explanation of the observed concentration of mass in singular structures is provided by the Zeldovich approximation, which takes the form of free-streaming flow for perturbations of a uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe in co-moving coordinates. The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Amp\`ere measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Amp\`ere measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier &amp; Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast. Soc. 346, 2003). In a neighborhood of merging singular structures in our examples, however, we show that reconstruction yielding a monotone Lagrangian map cannot be exact a.e., even off of the singularities themselves.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness results for positive harmonic functions on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some Liouville-type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, thereby confirming some cases of Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31, 2021).
  We further investigate Wang's conjecture on warped product manifolds and provide a partial verification of this conjecture, which also yields an alternative proof of Gu-Li's resolution of the conjecture in the $\mathbb{B}^n$ case (Math. Ann. 391, 2025). Our approach is based on a general principle of employing the P-function method to such Liouville-type results, with particular emphasis on the role of a closed conformal vector field inherent to such manifolds.</description>

      <title>Locally uniform ellipticity of the fractional Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], Caffarelli-Charro introduced a fractional Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. Later, Wu [17] generalized it to a fractional analogue of $k$-Hessian operators and proved the strict ellipticity for $k=2$. In this paper, we introduce a fractional analogue of general Hessian operators and prove the stability. We also show that the fractional analogue $k$-Hessian operators defined in [17] are strictly elliptic with respect to convex solutions for all $2 \leq k \leq n$. Furthermore, we provide a new proof for the case $k=2$ without the convexity condition.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to Hardy-type inequalities with Bessel pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide suitable characterisations of pairs of weights $(V,W),$ known as Bessel pairs, that ensure the validity of weighted Hardy-type inequalities. The abstract approach adopted here makes it possible to establish such inequalities also going beyond the classical Euclidean setting and also within a more general $L^p$ framework. As a byproduct of our method, we obtain explicit expressions for the maximizing functions and, in certain specific situations, we show that the associated constants are sharp. We emphasise that our approach unifies, generalises and improves several existing results in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of uniqueness of Leray solutions to the three-dimensional Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system. We establish uniqueness whenever the fluid velocity field belongs to the Cannone-Meyer-Planchon class, which allows to go beyond the Osgood uniqueness class. A stability estimate in this setting is also provided.</description>

      <title>Explicit pulsating fronts and minimal speeds in periodic Fisher-KPP equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Fisher-KPP equation with spatially periodic diffusion and reaction terms. We identify a class of periodic media for which the equation admits an explicit, closed-form solution. Through a nonlinear change of variables, the problem is reduced to the homogeneous Fisher-KPP equation, allowing us to construct an exact pulsating traveling front that connects the positive periodic stationary state to 0. We also derive an explicit expression for the asymptotic spreading speed and establish new asymptotic and comparison results.</description>

      <title>On Rayleigh quotients connected to $p$-Laplace equations with polynomial nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open set and $p,q,r&gt;1$. The main observation of the present work is the following: $W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$-solutions of the equation $-\Delta_p u = \mu |u|^{q-2}u + |u|^{r-2}u$ parameterized by $\mu$ are in bijection with properly normalized critical points of the $0$-homogeneous Rayleigh type quotient $R_\alpha(u)=\|\nabla u\|_p^p/ (\|u\|_q^{\alpha p} \|u\|_r^{p-\alpha p})$ parameterized by $\alpha$. We study this bijection and properties of $R_\alpha$ for various relations between $p,q,r$. In particular, for the generalized convex-concave problem (the case $q&lt;p&lt;r$) the bijection allows to provide the existence and characterization of all degenerate solutions corresponding to the inflection point of the fibred energy functional: they are critical points of $R_\alpha$ exclusively with $\alpha = (r-p)/(r-q)$. In the subhomogeneous case $q&lt;r \leq p$ and under additional assumptions on $\Omega$, the ground state level of $R_\alpha$ is simple and isolated, and minimizers of $R_\alpha$ exhaust the whole set of sign-constant solutions of the corresponding equation. In the superhomogeneous case $p &lt; q&lt;r$, there are no sign-changing critical points in a vicinity of the ground state level of $R_\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Observable sets for free Schr\"odinger equation on combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study observability for the free Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t u = i\Delta u$ on combinatorial graphs $G=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$. A subset $E\subset\mathcal{V}$ is observable at time $T&gt;0$ if there exists $C(T,E)&gt;0$ such that for all $u_0\in l^2(\mathcal{V})$, $$ \|u_0\|_{l^2(\mathcal{V})}^2 \le C(T,E)\int_0^T \|e^{it\Delta}u_0\|_{l^2(E)}^2\,dt. $$
  On the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ we obtain a sharp threshold for thick sets: if $E\subset\mathbb{Z}$ is $\gamma$-thick with $\gamma\geq1/2$, then $E$ is observable at some time; conversely, for every $\gamma&lt;1/2$ there exists a $\gamma$-thick set that is not observable at any time. This critical threshold marks the exact point where the discrete lattice departs from the real line: on the lattice it must be attained, whereas on $\R$ any $\gamma$-thick set with $\gamma&gt;0$ already suffices.
  On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ we show that complements of finite sets are observable at any time $T&gt;0$. This is a similar result to Euclidean space $\R^d$: any set that contains the exterior of a finite ball is observable at any time, in analogy with the free Schr\"odinger flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  For finite graphs we give an equivalent characterization of observability in terms of the zero sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions. As an application, we construct unobservable sets of large density on discrete tori, in contrast with the continuous torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, where every nonempty open set is observable.</description>

Abstract: We consider an initial-boundary value problem motivated by a mathematical model of moisture transport in porous media. We establish the existence of strong solutions and provide an error estimate for the approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method. In the proof of the error estimate, the Gagliardo--Nirenberg type inequality for the difference between a continuous function and a piecewise constant function plays an important role.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the restriction estimates for 2D surfaces S := {(xi1, xi2, xi1^3 +/- xi2^3) : (xi1, xi2) in [0,1]^2} by reducing to Guth's result on the perturbed paraboloid and Buschenhenke-Muller-Vargas's result on the perturbed hyperboloid. The method is based on the rescaling technique, developed in [LMZ21a]. Besides, we will use the estimates to give a better analysis for discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive four new candidates for an intrinsic viscosity operator on an ellipsoid by using the heuristic of the thin shell limit along the scaling direction of the ellipsoid. We show that the general method of the thin shell limit through the asymptotic expansion depends on the averaging method used. We consider both the homogeneous Navier and Hodge boundary conditions. We also obtain a geometric representation of these two boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that optimal transport suffers from the curse of dimensionality: when the prescribed marginals are approximated by i.i.d. samples, the convergence of the empirical optimal transport problem to the population counterpart slows exponentially with increasing dimension. Entropically regularized optimal transport (EOT) has become the standard bearer in many statistical applications as it avoids this curse. Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable. However, its potentials are not smooth (do not belong to a Donsker class) and its dual problem is not strongly concave, hence QOT is often assumed to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we show that QOT nevertheless has parametric sample complexity. More precisely, we establish central limit theorems for its dual potentials, optimal couplings, and optimal costs. Our analysis is based on novel arguments that focus on the regularity of the support of the optimal QOT coupling. Specifically, we establish a Lipschitz property of its sections and leverage VC theory to bound its statistical complexity. Our analysis also leads to gradient estimates of independent interest, including $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the population potentials.</description>

      <title>The Age-Structured Chemostat with Substrate Dynamics as a Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the well-posedness of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Dean-Kawasaki (VFPDK) equation with correlated noise, which arises as a fluctuating mean-field limit of second-order Newtonian particle systems. We focus on the case of bounded nonlocal interactions and a diffusion coefficient of square-root type. In this setting, we prove existence and uniqueness of renormalized kinetic solutions. The proof relies on a novel combination of kinetic semigroup estimates with the framework of renormalized kinetic solutions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a dynamical energy functional on compact ancient asymptotically Ricci-flat Ricci flows with modest decay using limits of conjugate heat flows. This functional satisfies a steady Ricci breather-type rigidity and provides an upper bound for the ordinary $\lambda$-functional while retaining many of its properties. In addition, motivated by work of Colding and Minicozzi, we derive local eigenvalue estimates for normalized Ricci flows coupled with conjugate heat flows.</description>

      <title>On smooth approximation of integral cycles mod 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every mod 2 integral cycle $T$ in a Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ can be approximated in flat norm by a cycle which is a smooth submanifold $\Sigma$ of nearly the same area, up to a singular set of codimension 3; in addition, this estimate on the singular set can be refined depending on the codimension of the cycle. Moreover, if the mod 2 homology class $\tau$ admits a smooth embedded representative, then $\Sigma$ can be chosen free of singularities. This article provides the unoriented version of the smooth approximation theorem for integral cycles.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing solutions to the Escobar problem on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a $n-$dimensional compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions. In addition, we show that when $n\ge5$, the minimal boundary problem possesses infinitely many sign-changing solutions on the unit ball. Our approach is variational and relies on the analysis of suitable conformal invariants and sharp energy estimates derived from Escobar's work.</description>

      <title>A coupled rate-dependent/rate-independent system for adhesive contact in Kirchhoff-Love plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a dimension reduction analysis for a coupled rate-dependent/rate-independent adhesive-contact model in the setting of visco-elastodynamic plates. We work with a weak solvability notion inspired by the theory of (purely) rate-independent processes, and accordingly term the related solutions `Semistable Energetic'. For Semistable Energetic solutions, the momentum balance holds in a variational sense, whereas the flow rule for the adhesion parameter is replaced by a semi-stability condition coupled with an energy-dissipation inequality. Prior to addressing the dimension reduction analysis, we show that Semistable Energetic solutions to the three-dimensional damped adhesive contact model converge, as the viscosity term tends to zero, to three-dimensional Semistable Energetic solutions for the undamped corresponding system. We then perform a dimension reduction analysis, both in the case of a vanishing viscosity tensor, and in the complementary setting in which the damping is assumed to go to infinity as the thickness of the plate tends to zero. In both regimes, the presence of adhesive contact yields a nontrivial coupling of the in-plane and out-of-plane contributions. In the vanishing-viscosity case we additionally confine the analysis to the case in which also inertia is neglected: in the vanishing-thickness limit we thus obtain purely rate-independent evolution for the adhesive contact phenomenon, still formulated in terms of the Semistable Energetic solution concept. In the second, undamped scenario, inertia is instead encompassed, thus the limiting evolution retains a mixed rate-dependent/rate-independent character, and is again given in terms of an energy-dissipation inequality and a semistability condition.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of entropy solutions and gradient flows for pressureless 1D Euler systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributional solutions of pressureless Euler systems on the line. In particular we show that Lagrangian solutions, introduced by Brenier, Gangbo, Savar\'{e} and Westdickenberg, and entropy solutions, studied by Nguyen and Tudorascu for the Euler--Poisson system, are equivalent. For the Euler--Poisson system this can be seen as a generalization to second-order systems of the equivalence between $L^2$-gradient flows and entropy solutions for a first-order aggregation equation proved by Bonaschi, Carrillo, Di Francesco and Peletier. The key observation is an equivalence between Ole\u{\i}nik's E-condition for conservation laws and a characterization due to Natile and Savar\'{e} of the normal cone for $L^2$-gradient flows. This new equivalence allows us to define unique solutions after blow-up for classical solutions of the Euler--Poisson system with quadratic confinement due to Carrillo, Choi and Zatorska, as well as to describe their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is a local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. The time of existence that we obtain is uniform with respect to the size $\epsilon$ of the perturbation, and boils down to the large time $1/\epsilon$ with the assumptions of the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020. With additional assumptions, it is also uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional wave kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although wave kinetic equations have been rigorously derived in dimension $d \geq 2$, both the physical and mathematical theory of wave turbulence in dimension $d = 1$ is less understood. Here, we look at the one-dimensional MMT (Majda, McLaughlin, and Tabak) model on a large interval of length $L$ with nonlinearity of size $\alpha$, restricting to the case where there are no derivatives in the nonlinearity. The dispersion relation here is $|k|^\sigma$ for $0 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$ and $\sigma \neq 1$, and when $\sigma = 2$, the MMT model specializes to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. In the range of $1 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$, the proposed collision kernel in the kinetic equation is trivial, begging the question of what is the appropriate kinetic theory in that setting. In this paper we study the kinetic limit $L \to \infty$ and $\alpha \to 0$ under various scaling laws $\alpha \sim L^{-\gamma}$ and exhibit the wave kinetic equation up to timescales $T \sim L^{-\epsilon}\alpha^{-\frac{5}{4}}$ (or $T \sim L^{-\epsilon} T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{\frac{5}{8}}$). In the case of a trivial collision kernel, our result implies there can be no nontrivial dynamics of the second moment up to timescales $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$.</description>

      <title>Front propagation into unstable states for periodic monotone reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the invasion fronts of spatially periodic monotone reaction-diffusion systems in a multi-dimensional setting. We study the pulsating traveling waves that connect the trivial equilibrium, for which all components of the state variable are identically equal to zero, to a uniformly persistent stationary state, for which all components are uniformly positive. When the trivial equilibrium is linearly unstable, we show that all pulsating traveling waves have a speed that is greater than the speed of the linearized system at the equilibrium, in any given direction. If moreover the nonlinearity is sublinear, then we can construct a pulsating traveling wave that travels at any super-linear speed in any given direction (i.e. the minimal speed is linearly determined). We also show that pulsating traveling waves are monotonic in time as soon as the nonlinearity is sub-homogeneous. Beyond these general qualitative properties, the main focus of the paper is to derive sufficient conditions for the existence and nonexistence of pulsating waves propagating in any given direction. Our proof of the existence part relies upon a new level of understanding of the multi-dimensional pulsating waves observed from a direction-dependent coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06946v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniqueness of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem has been a long standing problem in convex geometry. In the groundbreaking paper by Brendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos (Acta Math, {\bf219}, 2017), a full uniqueness result was shown for the subcritical exponents $p\in(-n-1,1]$. In the supercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even on the planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews in (J. Amer. Math. Soc., {\bf16}, 2003), where he established that the uniqueness holds in the range $p\in(-7,-2)$ and fails to hold for the other supercritical exponents $p\in(-\infty,-7)$. In this paper, we study the same uniqueness problem in the full supercritical range $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher dimensional cases $n\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\S}^n$. The uniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426), where non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions have been constructed for all $p\in(-\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general solutions which may not be symmetric, the uniqueness set $\Gamma$ of $p$ for which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed in the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review recent results on stability and instability in logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, with a particular emphasis on strong norms. We consider several versions of these inequalities on the Euclidean space, for the Lebesgue and the Gaussian measures, and discuss their differences in terms of moments and stability. We give new and direct proofs, as well as examples and discuss the stability of a logarithmic uncertainty principle. Although we do not cover all aspects of the topic, we hope to contribute to establishing the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem to the basic equations of fluid dynamics on the torus. Firstly, we construct a new initial data and provide a simple proof on the ill-posedness of $B^s_{p,\infty}$ solution of the Euler equations and the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, which covers the results obtained by Cheskidov-Shvydkoy \cite{CS} and Misio{\l}ek-Yoneda \cite{MY}. Secondly, we prove the failure of the $B^s_{p,\infty}$-convergence in the inviscid limit for both the Navier-Stokes equations and the surface quasi-geostrophic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the method of modulus of continuity for solutions of parabolic equations--as used, for instance, to prove the Fundamental Gap Conjecture--to solutions of non-local heat equations on R^n and in dimension one with a non-local Neumann boundary condition. Specifically, we show that if a solution of a non-local heat equation has an initial modulus of continuity satisfying simple criteria, then this modulus of continuity is preserved at all subsequent times. In the process of trying to generalise our result in one dimension, we found a counterexample suggesting that a non-local analogue of the Payne-Weinberger inequality would depend on more than the diameter of a bounded (convex) domain.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve an open problem left in the monographs \cite[Bahouri-Chemin-Danchin, (2011)]{BCD}. Precisely speaking, it was obtained in \cite[Theorem 7.1 on pp293, (2011)]{BCD} the existence and uniqueness of $B^s_{p,\infty}$ solution for the Euler equations. We furthermore prove that the solution map of the Euler equation is not continuous in the Besov spaces from $B^s_{p,\infty}$ to $L_T^\infty B^s_{p,\infty}$ for $s&gt;1+d/p$ with $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and in the H\"{o}lder spaces from $C^{k,\alpha}$ to $L_T^\infty C^{k,\alpha}$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$ and $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which later covers particularly the ill-posedness of $C^{1,\alpha}$ solution in \cite[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., (2018)]{MYtams}. Beyond purely technical aspects on the choice of initial data, a remarkable novelty of the proof is the construction of an approximate solution to the Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic instability for the forced Navier--Stokes equations in critical Besov spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic stability is one of the classical problems in the field of mathematical analysis of fluid mechanics. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 3$, it is easily proved by the standard argument that if the given small external force decays at temporal infinity, then the small forced Navier--Stokes flow also strongly converges to zero as time tends to infinity in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $1 \leq p &lt; n$ and $1 \leq q &lt; \infty$. In the present paper, we show that this asymptotic stability fails for $p \geq n$ with $n \geq 3$ in the sense that there exist arbitrary small external forces whose critical Besov norm decays in large time, whereas the corresponding Navier--Stokes flows oscillate and do not strongly converge as $t \to \infty$ in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Moreover, we find that the situation is different in the two-dimensional case $n=2$ and show the forced Navier--Stokes flow is asymptotically unstable in $\dot{B}_{p,1}^{2/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Our instability does not appear in the linear level but is caused by the nonlinear interaction from external forces.</description>

Abstract: Multilinear $L^p$ extrapolation results are established in a limited-range, multilinear, and off-diagonal setting for mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces over $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. Integrability exponents are allowed in the full range $(0,\infty]$. We detach the exponents for the weight classes completely from the exponents for the initial and target spaces for the extrapolation except for the basic consistency condition. This enables to cover the full range $(0,\infty]$ for all integrability exponents and provides new insights into the dependency of the extrapolated bounds on the weight characteristic. Certain endpoint results are new even for $\mathbb{R}^d$. Additionally, in the setting of compact abelian groups, a weighted transference principle is established.</description>

      <title>Segregated solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with sublinear coupling terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of infinitely many nonnegative, segregated solutions for the sublinearly coupled Schr\"odinger system \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta u + K_1(x)u = \mu u^{p-1} + \beta u^{\sigma_1}v^{\sigma_2+1} \\ -\Delta v + K_2(x)v = \nu v^{p-1} + \beta u^{\sigma_1+1}v^{\sigma_2} \end{cases} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N \] where $N \geq 2$, $p \in (2,2^*)$, $2^* = 2N/(N-2)$ ($2^* = \infty$ if $N=2$), $K_j$ are radial potentials, $\mu, \nu &gt; 0$, $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and critically $\sigma_j \in (0,1)$. The sublinear coupling exponents $\sigma_j$ introduce fundamental challenges due to nonsmooth nonlinearities and singularities in standard reduction methods. To overcome this, we develop an enhanced Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction framework. By recasting the problem within a specially constructed metric space of local minimizers for an outer boundary value problem, we derive sharp a priori estimates enabling contraction mapping arguments. This approach circumvents the limitations of classical methods for sublinear couplings. We further uncover a novel "dead core" phenomenon: solutions $(u_\ell, v_\ell)$ exhibit non-strict positivity with topological segregation. Specially, for $N=2$ and large integers $\ell$, there exist radii $0 &lt; R_1 &lt; R_2$ such that $\text{supp } u_\ell \subset B_{R_2}(0)$, $\text{supp } v_\ell \subset \mathbb{R}^N \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$, and $u_\ell + v_\ell \to 0$ uniformly in $B_{R_2}(0) \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$ as $\ell \to \infty$. Our methodology provides a versatile framework for handling nonsmooth nonlinearities in reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantitative differentiability on uniformly rectifiable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove $L^p$ quantitative differentiability estimates for functions defined on uniformly rectifiable subsets of the Euclidean space. More precisely, we show that a Dorronsoro-type theorem holds in this context: the $L^p$ norm of the gradient of a Sobolev function $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ is comparable to the $L^p$ norm of a new square function measuring both the affine deviation of $f$ and how flat the subset $E$ is. A corollary dealing with extensions and traces of Sobolev functions may be found in a companion article.</description>

      <title>Computation of the deformation of rhombi-slit kirigami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kirigami are part of the larger class of mechanical metamaterials, which exhibit exotic properties. This article focuses on rhombi-slits, which is a specific type of kirigami. A nonlinear kinematic model was previously proposed as a second order divergence-form PDE with a possibly degenerate, and sign-changing coefficient matrix. We first propose to study the existence of solutions to a regularization of this equation by using the limiting absorption principle. Then, we propose a finite element method with complex polynomials to approximate the solutions to the nonlinear equation. Finally, simulations are compared with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Hessian stability and convergence rates for entropic and Sinkhorn potentials via semiconcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of entropic potentials, \ie, the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport problem. To the authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability estimates for entropic transport plans and for gradients of entropic potentials as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ``magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>
