      <title>Critical properties of metallic and deconfined quantum critical points in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in a bilayer honeycomb model, focusing on their quantum critical and finite-temperature properties. At weak interaction, a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal state is realized. At intermediate and strong interaction, respectively, two long-range-ordered phases that break different symmetries are stabilized. The ordered phases feature partial and full, respectively, gap openings in the fermion spectrum. We clarify the symmetries of the different zero-temperature phases and the symmetry breaking patterns across the two quantum phase transitions between them. The first transition between the disordered and long-range-ordered semimetallic phases has previously been argued to be described by the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu-SO(3) field theory. By performing simulations with an improved symmetric Trotter decomposition, we further substantiate this claim by computing the critical exponents $1/\nu$, $\eta_\phi$, and $\eta_\psi$, which turn out to be consistent with the field-theoretical expectation within numerical and analytical uncertainties. The second transition between the two long-range-ordered phases has previously been proposed as a possible instance of a metallic deconfined quantum critical point. We further develop this scenario by analyzing the spectral functions in the single-particle, particle-hole, and particle-particle channels. Our results indicate gapless excitations with a unique velocity, supporting the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at criticality. We also determine the finite-temperature phase boundaries above the fully gapped state at large interaction, which smoothly vanish near the putative metallic deconfined quantum critical point, consistent with a continuous or weakly first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Percolation renormalization group analysis of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical study of confinement in lattice gauge theories (LGTs) remains a difficult task to this day. Taking a geometric perspective on confinement, we develop a real-space renormalization group (RG) formalism for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using percolation probability as a confinement order parameter. The RG flow we analyze is constituted by both the percolation probability and the coupling parameters. We consider a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in two dimensions, with matter and thermal fluctuations, and analytically derive the confinement phase diagram. We find good agreement with numerical and exact benchmark results and confirm that a finite matter density enforces confinement at $T&lt;\infty$ in the model we consider. Our RG scheme enables future analytical studies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs with matter and quantum fluctuations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Towards Hypernuclei from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <title>Subvolume method for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: topological charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the previously-developed sub-volume method to study the $\theta$-dependence of the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. We calculate the first two coefficients, the topological susceptibility $\chi$ and the fourth cumulant $b_2$, in the $\theta$-expansion of the free energy density around the critical temperature ($T_c$) for the confinement-deconfinement transition. Lattice calculations are performed with three different spatial sizes $24^3,32^3,48^3$ to monitor finite size effects, while the temporal size is fixed to be $8$. The systematic uncertainty associated with the sub-volume extrapolation is studied with special care. The sub-volume method allows us to determine the values of $b_2$ much more accurately than the standard full-volume method, and we successfully identify the temperature dependence of $b_2$ around $T_c$. Our numerical results suggest that the $\theta$-dependence of the free energy density near $\theta=0$ changes from $4\chi(1-\cos(\theta/2))$ to $\chi(1-\cos\theta)$ as the temperature crosses $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Coherent and dissipative dynamics at quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02626v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the 3D Ising Transition on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009 (2023)]. By introducing an additional $SU(2)$ layer degree of freedom, we reformulate the model into a form suitable for sign-problem-free QMC simulation. From the finite-size-scaling, we show that this QMC-friendly model undergoes a quantum phase transition belonging to the 3D Ising universality class, and at the critical point we compute the scaling dimensions from the state-operator correspondence, which largely agrees with the prediction from the conformal field theory. These results pave the way to construct sign-problem-free models for QMC simulations on the fuzzy sphere, which could advance the future study on more sophisticated criticalities.</description>

      <title>Partial-transpose-guided entanglement classes and minimum noise filtering in many-body Gaussian quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states ($\mathcal{N}$IC) is here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure, resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian states ($\mathcal{N}$-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of local detectors.</description>
