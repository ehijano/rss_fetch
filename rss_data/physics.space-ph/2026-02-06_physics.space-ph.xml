      <title>Auroral signatures of ballooning instability and plasmoid formation processes in the near-Earth magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear development of ballooning instability and the subsequently induced plasmoid formation in the near-Earth magnetotail demonstrated in MHD simulations has been proposed as a potential trigger mechanism for substorm onset over the past decade, and their connections to the in-situ satellite and ground all-sky auroral optical observations have been a subject of continued research. In this work, a set of THEMIS substorm onset events with good conjunction of auroral observations has been selected for comparative simulation study, whose pre-onset magnetotail configuration and conditions are inferred from in-situ data and compared with the onset conditions of ballooning instability obtained in our MHD simulations. The evolution of the near-Earth magnetotail is followed, where the signatures of ballooning instability and the plasmoid formation are extracted from simulations and compared with the magnetic fields and flow patterns within the magnetotail region from observation data. The field-aligned current (FAC) density is evaluated at the Earth side boundary of the magnetotail domain of simulation, which is further mapped along magnetic field lines to the auroral ionosphere and compared with the auroral pattern and evolution there in terms of growth rate, dominant wavenumber, and absolute auroral intensities. Such validation efforts are also the first step towards the development of a self-consistent coupling model that includes the magnetotail-ionosphere interaction in the substorm onset process.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Robustness and Adaptability in Learning-Based Mission Planning for Active Debris Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.</description>

      <title>An approximate Kappa generator for particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random number generator for the Kappa velocity distribution in particle simulations is proposed. Approximating the cumulative distribution function with the q-exponential function, an inverse transform procedure is constructed. The proposed method provides practically accurate results, in particular for k&lt;4. It runs fast on graphics processing units (GPUs). The derivation, numerical validation, and relevance to GPU execution models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coordinate Systems and Transforms in Space Physics: Terms, Definitions, Implementations, and Recommendations for Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In space physics, acronyms for coordinate systems (e.g., \texttt{GEI}, \texttt{GSM}) are commonly used; however, differences in their definitions and implementations can prevent reproducibility. In this work, we compare definitions in online resources, software packages, and frequently cited journal articles and show that implementation differences can lead to transformations between same-named coordinate systems and position values from different data providers to differ significantly. Based on these comparisons and results, and to enable reproducibility, we recommend that (a) a standard for acronyms and definitions for coordinate systems is developed; (b) a standards body develops a citable database of reference data needed for these transforms; (c) a central authority maintains the SPICE (Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix, Events) kernels used by space physics spacecraft missions to generate data products in different coordinate systems; and (d) software developers provide explicit comparisons of their implementations with the results of (b) and documentation on implementation choices. Additionally, we provide recommendations for scientists and metadata developers to ensure that sufficient information is provided to enable reproducibility.</description>
