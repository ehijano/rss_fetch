      <title>One Plus One Equals Two Ones: On Identity, Aggregation, and Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A childhood observation of Thakur Anukulchandra that "one and one can only be two ones, not simply two" motivates a precise inquiry: what, exactly, is asserted when we pass from two concrete individuals to the numeral "2"? This paper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what this equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two complementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation by the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals U, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality preserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U-&gt;T (coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)-&gt;M(T) and the unique counting homomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of information loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by worldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that preserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem: A+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled copy. The numeral "2" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable after an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity. Conclusion. In reality, one plus one is two ones; "1+1=2" is the value of a counting map applied after coarse graining. This clarifies the separation between identity-preserving aggregation and counting, reconciles everyday arithmetic with physical non-identity, and makes explicit the modeling choice that every act of counting entails. Our analysis has implications for the philosophy of mathematics, measurement theory, and information theoretic approaches to classification.</description>

      <title>Descriptive set theory of separable Fr\'echet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past few decades, much has been done regarding the descriptive set theory of separable Banach spaces. However, the descriptive properties of separable Fr\'echet spaces have not yet been investigated. In these notes, we look at this problem, its relation with the (now standard) theory for separable Banach spaces, and we compute/estimate the descriptive complexity of some classical classes of separable Fr\'echet spaces such as Fr\'echet-Hilbert, Schwartz, nuclear, and Montel spaces. Our main result shows that the class of Montel spaces is complete coanalytic. Noticeably, this applies outside the realm of descriptive set theory and solves an old problem regarding Fr\'echet spaces satisfying the Heine--Borel property (i.e., Montel spaces). Precisely, we show that there is no separable Montel space containing isomorphic copies of all separable Montel spaces.</description>

      <title>Toposes with enough points as categories of \'etale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Makkai duality between coherent toposes and ultracategories to a duality between toposes with enough points and ultraconvergence spaces. Our proof generalizes and simplifies Makkai's original proof. Our main result can also be seen as an extension to ionads of Barr's equivalence between topological spaces and relational modules for the ultrafilter monad. In view of the correspondence between toposes and geometric theories, we obtain a strong conceptual completeness theorem, in the sense of Makkai, for geometric theories with enough Set-models. The same result has recently been obtained indepedently by Saadia (arXiv:2506.23935) and by Hamad (arXiv:2507.07922). Both of their proofs rely on groupoid representations of toposes, which our proof here does not assume.</description>

      <title>Poset-enriched pretoposes and compact ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of the category $\mathsf{KOrd}$ of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces as a poset-enriched category. Up to equivalence, $\mathsf{KOrd}$ is the only non-degenerate poset-enriched pretopos whose terminal object is a (discrete) generator and in which every object is covered by an order-filtral object. Order-filtral objects satisfy an appropriate form of compactness and separation. Throughout, we make extensive use of the internal language of poset-enriched pretoposes.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform view of Craig interpolation in modal logics with linear frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normal modal logics extending the logic K4.3 of linear transitive frames are known to lack the Craig interpolation property, except some logics of bounded depth such as S5. We turn this `negative' fact into a research question and pursue a non-uniform approach to Craig interpolation by investigating the following interpolant existence problem: decide whether there exists a Craig interpolant between two given formulas in any fixed logic above K4.3. Using a bisimulation-based characterisation of interpolant existence for descriptive frames, we show that this problem is decidable and coNP-complete for all finitely axiomatisable normal modal logics containing K4.3. It is thus not harder than entailment in these logics, which is in sharp contrast to other recent non-uniform interpolation results. We also extend our approach to Priorean temporal logics (with both past and future modalities) over the standard time flows-the integers, rationals, reals, and finite strict linear orders-none of which is blessed with the Craig interpolation property.</description>
