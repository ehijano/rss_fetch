      <title>Physics-Informed Critic in an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Feedback-voltage driven chaos in three-terminal spin-torque oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of chaos in nanomagnet suggest a possibility of new spintronics applications such as random-number generator and neuromorphic computing. However, large amount of electric current and/or magnetic field are necessary for the excitation of chaos, which are unsuitable for energy-saving applications. Here, we propose an excitation of chaos in three-terminal spin-torque oscillator (STO). The driving force of the chaos is voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, which enables us to manipulate magnetization dynamics without spending electric current or magnetic field, and thus, energy efficient. In particular, we focus on the VCMA effect generated by feedback signal from the STO since feedback effect is known to be effective in exciting chaos in dynamical system. Solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation numerically and applying temporal and statistical analyses to its solution, the existence of the chaotic and transient-chaotic magnetization dynamics driven by the feedback VCMA effect is identified.</description>

      <title>Active search for Bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bifurcations mark qualitative changes of long-term behavior in dynamical systems and can often signal sudden ("hard") transitions or catastrophic events (divergences). Accurately locating them is critical not just for deeper understanding of observed dynamic behavior, but also for designing efficient interventions. When the dynamical system at hand is complex, possibly noisy, and expensive to sample, standard (e.g. continuation based) numerical methods may become impractical. We propose an active learning framework, where Bayesian Optimization is leveraged to discover saddle-node or Hopf bifurcations, from a judiciously chosen small number of vector field observations. Such an approach becomes especially attractive in systems whose state x parameter space exploration is resource-limited. It also naturally provides a framework for uncertainty quantification (aleatoric and epistemic), useful in systems with inherent stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Bell inequalities as a tool to probe quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a permutationally invariant multipartite Bell inequality for many-body three-level systems and use it to explore a possible connection between the presence of nonlocality and quantum chaos. For this, we interpret the Bell operator resulting from fixing the measurement settings as a system Hamiltonian and explore the energy level spacing distribution for different measurement choices and SU(3) irreducible representations. Interestingly, we find that in every irreducible representation displaying nonlocality, the measurement settings yielding maximal violation result in a Bell operator whose energy level spacing distribution signals the absence of quantum chaos. This situation changes when the measurement settings slightly depart from the optimal ones, as we generally observe a level spacing distribution characteristic of chaotic systems. Our work suggests an intriguing connection between Bell nonlocality, quantum chaos and random matrix theory. These subjects belonged to the beloved areas of the late Fritz Haake, and we dedicate this paper to his memory.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like behavior of an active particle in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A macroscopic, self-propelled wave-particle entity (WPE) that emerges as a walking droplet on the surface of a vibrating liquid bath exhibits several hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We explore the rich dynamical and quantum-like features emerging in a model of an idealized one-dimensional wave-particle entity in a double-well potential. The integro-differential equation of motion for the WPE transforms to a Lorenz-like system, which we explore in detail. We observe the analog of quantized eigenstates as discrete limit cycles that arise by varying the width of the double-well potential, and also in the form of multistability with coexisting limit cycles. These states show narrow as well as wide energy level splitting. Tunneling-like behavior is also observed where the WPE erratically transitions between the two wells of the double-well potential. We rationalize this phenomena in terms of crisis-induced intermittency. Further, we discover a fractal structure in the escape time distribution of the particle from a well based on initial conditions, indicating unpredictability of this tunneling-like intermittent behavior at all scales. The chaotic intermittent dynamics lead to wave-like emergent features in the probability distribution of particle's position that show qualitative similarity with its quantum counterpart. Lastly, rich dynamical features are also observed such as a period doubling route to chaos as well as self-similar periodic islands in the chaotic parameter set.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Inductive Biases of Graph Neural ODE for Modeling Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with physics based inductive biases such as Lagrangian neural networks (LNN), and Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) learn the dynamics of physical systems by encoding strong inductive biases. Alternatively, Neural ODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar performances. However, these models, when applied to particle based systems, are transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes. In this paper, we present a graph based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time evolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyse the role of different inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that, similar to LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments also assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newtons third law, on the final performance of the model. We demonstrate that inducing these biases can enhance the performance of model by orders of magnitude in terms of both energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the GNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE, outperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph networks (LGN) and Hamiltonian graph networks (HGN) in terms of energy violation error by approx 4 orders of magnitude for a pendulum system, and approx 2 orders of magnitude for spring systems. These results suggest that competitive performances with energy conserving neural networks can be obtained for NODE based systems by inducing appropriate inductive biases.</description>
