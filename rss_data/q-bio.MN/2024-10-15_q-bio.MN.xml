      <title>Transcriptome and Redox Proteome Reveal Temporal Scales of Carbon Metabolism Regulation in Model Cyanobacteria Under Light Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systems approach based on an energy-landscape concept to differentiate interactions involving redox activities and conformational changes of proteins and nucleic acids interactions in multi-layered protein-DNA regulatory networks under light disturbance. Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary origin of the bipartite architecture of dissipative cellular networks</title>

Abstract: Recently, plenty research has been done on discovering the role of energy dissipation in biological networks, most of which focus on the relationship of dissipation and functionality. However, the development of networks science urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading networks and the general case of energy-driven networks. We find fuel decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering dissipative networks, higher performance. We conclude that fuel decoupling is an evolutionary outcome and bears benefits during evolution.</description>

      <title>Examining the Link Between Peroxiredoxin Proteins and Mutually Exclusive Transcription Factor Activation With a Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxidative stress is a fundamental stimulus to which eukaryotic cells respond via many channels. Among these channels are both protein systems that process oxidative stress, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system (PTRS), as well as changes in transcriptional activity that target outcomes such as growth, damage control and repair, or cell death. Recent work has revealed connections between the PTRS and temporal phases of transcriptional activity involving famous transcription factors like p53 and FOXO1. To examine potential mechanisms for these connections, we implement an existing dynamical systems mathematical model for the PTRS. We hypothesize that dose-dependent hyperoxidation events enact ultrasensitive switches by which the PTRS can categorize stress severity and activate appropriate transcriptional responses. Using numerical simulations of the PTRS in human cells, we provide a proof of principle for staggered, switchlike hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prx) as well as an underlying mechanism requiring simultaneous signaling by Prx I and II. Then, we use our model to make testable predictions about individual Prx knockouts as well as the affinity for hydrogen peroxide of Prx across oxidation states. This study provides direction for future experimental work and sheds light into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress response in human cells.</description>

      <title>Pathway Realisability in Chemical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of pathways and alternative pathways that have a specific function is of interest in numerous chemical contexts. A framework for specifying and searching for pathways has previously been developed, but a focus on which of the many pathway solutions are realisable, or can be made realisable, is missing. Realisable here means that there actually exists some sequencing of the reactions of the pathway that will execute the pathway. We present a method for analysing the realisability of pathways based on the reachability question in Petri nets. For realisable pathways, our method also provides a certificate encoding an order of the reactions which realises the pathway. We present two extended notions of realisability of pathways, one of which is related to the concept of network catalysts. We exemplify our findings on the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of our concepts for elucidating the choices often implicitly made when depicting pathways. Lastly, we lay the foundation for the mathematical theory of realisability.</description>
