      <title>Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation with Temporal-Aware Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence.
  We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution.
  Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</description>

      <title>Make the Fastest Faster: Importance Mask for Interactive Volume Visualization using Reconstruction Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizing a large-scale volumetric dataset with high resolution is challenging due to the high computational time and space complexity. Recent deep-learning-based image inpainting methods significantly improve rendering latency by reconstructing a high-resolution image for visualization in constant time on GPU from a partially rendered image where only a small portion of pixels go through the expensive rendering pipeline. However, existing methods need to render every pixel of a predefined regular sampling pattern. In this work, we provide Importance Mask Learning (IML) and Synthesis (IMS) networks which are the first attempts to learn importance regions from the sampling pattern to further minimize the number of pixels to render by jointly considering the dataset, user's view parameters, and the downstream reconstruction neural networks. Our solution is a unified framework to handle various image inpainting-based visualization methods through the proposed differentiable compaction/decompaction layers. Experiments show our method can further improve the overall rendering latency of state-of-the-art volume visualization methods using reconstruction neural network for free when rendering scientific volumetric datasets. Our method can also directly optimize the off-the-shelf pre-trained reconstruction neural networks without elongated retraining.</description>

      <title>DeepMill: Neural Accessibility Learning for Subtractive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturability is vital for product design and production, with accessibility being a key element, especially in subtractive manufacturing. Traditional methods for geometric accessibility analysis are time-consuming and struggle with scalability, while existing deep learning approaches in manufacturability analysis often neglect geometric challenges in accessibility and are limited to specific model types. In this paper, we introduce DeepMill, the first neural framework designed to accurately and efficiently predict inaccessible and occlusion regions under varying machining tool parameters, applicable to both CAD and freeform models. To address the challenges posed by cutter collisions and the lack of extensive training datasets, we construct a cutter-aware dual-head octree-based convolutional neural network (O-CNN) and generate an inaccessible and occlusion regions analysis dataset with a variety of cutter sizes for network training. Experiments demonstrate that DeepMill achieves 94.7% accuracy in predicting inaccessible regions and 88.7% accuracy in identifying occlusion regions, with an average processing time of 0.04 seconds for complex geometries. Based on the outcomes, DeepMill implicitly captures both local and global geometric features, as well as the complex interactions between cutters and intricate 3D models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing high-quality, closed-surface meshes from confined 3D point clouds via a physically-based simulation of flexible foils under spatial constraints. The approach integrates dynamic elasticity, pressure-driven deformation, and adaptive snapping to fixed vertices, providing a robust framework for realistic and physically accurate mesh creation.

      <title>VistaFlow: Photorealistic Volumetric Reconstruction with Dynamic Resolution Management via Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VistaFlow, a scalable three-dimensional imaging technique capable of reconstructing fully interactive 3D volumetric images from a set of 2D photographs. Our model synthesizes novel viewpoints through a differentiable rendering system capable of dynamic resolution management on photorealistic 3D scenes. We achieve this through the introduction of QuiQ, a novel intermediate video controller trained through Q-learning to maintain a consistently high framerate by adjusting render resolution with millisecond precision. Notably, VistaFlow runs natively on integrated CPU graphics, making it viable for mobile and entry-level devices while still delivering high-performance rendering. VistaFlow bypasses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), using the PlenOctree data structure to render complex light interactions such as reflection and subsurface scattering with minimal hardware requirements. Our model is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods with novel view synthesis at a resolution of 1080p at over 100 frames per second on consumer hardware. By tailoring render quality to the capabilities of each device, VistaFlow has the potential to improve the efficiency and accessibility of photorealistic 3D scene rendering across a wide spectrum of hardware, from high-end workstations to inexpensive microcontrollers.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their performance and simplicity, rigid body simulators are often used in applications where the objects of interest can considered very stiff. However, no material has infinite stiffness, which means there are potentially cases where the non-zero compliance of the seemingly rigid object can cause a significant difference between its trajectories when simulated in a rigid body or deformable simulator.
  Similarly to how adversarial attacks are developed against image classifiers, we propose an adversarial attack against rigid body simulators. In this adversarial attack, we solve an optimization problem to construct perceptually rigid adversarial objects that have the same collision geometry and moments of mass to a reference object, so that they behave identically in rigid body simulations but maximally different in more accurate deformable simulations. We demonstrate the validity of our method by comparing simulations of several examples in commercially available simulators.</description>

      <title>PINGS: Gaussian Splatting Meets Distance Fields within a Point-Based Implicit Neural Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots require high-fidelity reconstructions of their environment for effective operation. Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</description>

      <title>TANGLED: Generating 3D Hair Strands from Images with Arbitrary Styles and Viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hairstyles are intricate and culturally significant with various geometries, textures, and structures. Existing text or image-guided generation methods fail to handle the richness and complexity of diverse styles. We present TANGLED, a novel approach for 3D hair strand generation that accommodates diverse image inputs across styles, viewpoints, and quantities of input views. TANGLED employs a three-step pipeline. First, our MultiHair Dataset provides 457 diverse hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes, emphasizing complex and culturally significant styles to improve model generalization. Second, we propose a diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts that can capture topological cues (e.g., strand density and parting lines) while filtering out noise. By leveraging a latent diffusion model with cross-attention on lineart features, our method achieves flexible and robust 3D hair generation across diverse input conditions. Third, a parametric post-processing module enforces braid-specific constraints to maintain coherence in complex structures. This framework not only advances hairstyle realism and diversity but also enables culturally inclusive digital avatars and novel applications like sketch-based 3D strand editing for animation and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>DEGAS: Detailed Expressions on Full-Body Gaussian Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neural rendering has made significant advances in creating lifelike, animatable full-body and head avatars, incorporating detailed expressions into full-body avatars remains largely unexplored. We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</description>

      <title>Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding. Our project page is at https://physics-iq.github.io; code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/physics-IQ-benchmark.</description>

      <title>CookingDiffusion: Cooking Procedural Image Generation with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation models have excelled in creating diverse and realistic images. This success extends to food imagery, where various conditional inputs like cooking styles, ingredients, and recipes are utilized. However, a yet-unexplored challenge is generating a sequence of procedural images based on cooking steps from a recipe. This could enhance the cooking experience with visual guidance and possibly lead to an intelligent cooking simulation system. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task called \textbf{cooking procedural image generation}. This task is inherently demanding, as it strives to create photo-realistic images that align with cooking steps while preserving sequential consistency. To collectively tackle these challenges, we present \textbf{CookingDiffusion}, a novel approach that leverages Stable Diffusion and three innovative Memory Nets to model procedural prompts. These prompts encompass text prompts (representing cooking steps), image prompts (corresponding to cooking images), and multi-modal prompts (mixing cooking steps and images), ensuring the consistent generation of cooking procedural images. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we preprocess the YouCookII dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model excels at generating high-quality cooking procedural images with remarkable consistency across sequential cooking steps, as measured by both the FID and the proposed Average Procedure Consistency metrics. Furthermore, CookingDiffusion demonstrates the ability to manipulate ingredients and cooking methods in a recipe. We will make our code, models, and dataset publicly accessible.</description>
