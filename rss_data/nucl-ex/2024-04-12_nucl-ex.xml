      <title>Exclusive four pion photoproduction in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense photon fluxes from relativistic nuclei provide an opportunity to study photonuclear interactions in ultraperipheral collisions. The measurement of coherently photoproduced $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ final states in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV is presented for the first time. The cross section, d$\sigma$/d$y$, times the branching ratio ($\rho\rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^-$) is found to be $47.8\pm2.3~\rm{(stat.)}\pm7.7~\rm{(syst.)}$ mb in the rapidity interval $|y| &lt; 0.5$. The invariant mass distribution is not well described with a single Breit-Wigner resonance. The production of two interfering resonances, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$, provides a good description of the data. The values of the masses ($m$) and widths ($\Gamma$) of the resonances extracted from the fit are $m_{1}=1385\pm14~\rm{(stat.)}\pm3~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, $\Gamma_{1}=431\pm36~\rm{(stat.)}\pm82~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, $m_{2}=1663\pm13~\rm{(stat.)}\pm22~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$ and $\Gamma_{2}=357 \pm31~\rm{(stat.)}\pm49~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, respectively. The measured cross sections times the branching ratios are compared to recent theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Multifractal Dimension Spectrum Analysis for Nuclear Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an integral density method for calculating the multifractal dimension spectrum for the nucleon distribution in atomic nuclei. This method is then applied to analyze the non-uniformity of the density distribution in several typical types of nuclear matter distributions, including the Woods-Saxon distribution, the halo structure and the tetrahedral $\alpha$ clustering. The subsequent discussion provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the results obtained. The multifractal dimension spectrum shows remarkable sensitivity to the density distribution, establishing it as an effective tool for studying the distribution of nucleons in nuclear multibody systems.</description>

      <title>A new scheme for isomer pumping and depletion with high-power lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for the population and depletion of nuclear isomers. The scheme combines the $\gamma$-photons with energies $\gtrsim 10$ keV emitted during the interaction of a contemporary high-intensity laser pulse with a plasma and one or multiple photon beams supplied by intense lasers. Due to nonlinear effects, two- or multi-photon absorption dominates over the conventional multi-step one-photon process for an optimized gamma flash. Moreover, this nonlinear effect can be greatly enhanced with the help of externally supplied photons. These photons act such that the effective cross-section experienced by the $\gamma$-photons becomes tunable, growing with the intensity $I_0$ of the beam. Assuming $I_{0}\sim 10^{18}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ for the photon beam, an effective cross-section as large as $10^{-21}$ cm$^2$ to $10^{-28}$ cm$^2$ for the $\gamma-$photon can be achieved. Thus, within state-of-the-art 10 PW laser facilities, the yields from two-photon absorption can reach $10^6$ to $10^9$ isomers per shot for selected states that are separated from their ground state by E2 transitions. Similar yields for transitions with higher multipolarities can be accommodated by multi-photon absorption with additional photons provided.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Mini-jet Clustering Algorithm Using Transverse-momentum Seeds in High-energy Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to detect mini-jet clusters in high-energy nuclear collisions, by selecting a high-transverse-momentum ($p_T$) particle as a seed and assigning a clustering radius ($R$) in the pseudorapidity and azimuthal-angle space. Our PYTHIA simulations for $p$+$p$ collisions show that a scheme with a seeding $p_T$ of around 0.5 GeV/$c$ and $R$ of approximately 0.6 satisfactorily identifies mini-jet clusters. The correlation between clusters obtained in PYTHIA calculations using the algorithm exhibits the proper behavior of hard-scattering-like processes, suggesting its usefulness in isolating mini-jet-like clusters from non-hard-scattering soft processes when applied to actual nuclear-collision data, thereby allowing a closer examination of both the mini-jet and the soft mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether BNS mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here we demonstrate that a BNS population model informed by multimessenger neutron star observations predicts a merger rate and per-event r-process element yield consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints. If BNS mergers are to explain the r-process enrichment of stars in the Galaxy, we further show using a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model that they have to merge shortly after the formation of their progenitors, with a delay time distribution of power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90% confidence.Such short delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models and those observationally inferred from samples of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, we find that a two-channel enrichment scenario, where the second channel follows the star formation history, can account for both Galactic stellar and sGRB observations. Our results suggest that 45-90% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>
