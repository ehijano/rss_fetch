      <title>The space environment particle density in Low Earth Orbit based on two decades of in-situ observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently the only method to establish the prevalence of particles, space debris or meteoroids, sized between 1 micrometre and a few centimetres, in Earth orbit is by instruments or witness plates dedicated to in-situ detection. Derived usable datasets are remarkably scarce and generally only cover a short period of time and a single orbital region. Nonetheless, space environment models use those limited datasets as anchor points to extrapolate results to the entirety of Earth orbit, from the beginning of the space age to decades into the future. Here we present a readout of over 20 years of DEBris In orbit Evaluator 1 (DEBIE-1), an in-situ detector that was launched in October 2001, providing the longest continuous set of measurements available to date. The dataset has not been used in the generation of space environment models and hence provides a first independent source for the detection of environment changing events and for the calibration of long term evolution models.</description>

      <title>Impacting Atmospheres: How Late-Stage Pollution Alters Exoplanet Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric composition of exoplanets is often considered as a probe of the planet's formation condition. How exactly the initial chemical memory may be altered from the birth to the final state of the planet, however, remains unknown. Here, we develop a simple model of pollution of planetary atmosphere by the vaporization of infalling planetesimal of varying sizes and composition (SiO$_2$ inside 1 au and H$_2$O outside 1 au), following their trajectory and thermal evolution through the upper advective and radiative layers of a sub-Neptune class planet during the late stage of disk evolution. We vary the rate of pollution by changing the solid content of the disk and by dialing the level of disk gas depletion which in turn determines the rate of planetary migration. We find that pollution by silicate grains will always be limited by the saturation limit set by the thermal state of the atmosphere. By contrast, pollution by water ice can lead to $\sim$2--4 orders of magnitude variation in the atmospheric water mass fraction depending on the solid and gas content of the disk. Both cases suggest that post-formation pollution can erase the initial compositional memory of formation. Post-formation pollution can potentially transform sub-Neptunes with H/He-dominated envelope that initially formed beyond the iceline to waterworlds (water-enriched envelope) when the disk gas is depleted by $\gtrsim$2 orders of magnitude, allowing gentle migration. We additionally discuss the expected C/O ratio profile under pollution by water and refractory carbon species.</description>

      <title>Comparative Planetology of Magnetic Effects in Ultrahot Jupiters: Trends in High Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs), being the hottest class of exoplanets known, provide a unique laboratory for testing atmospheric interactions with internal planetary magnetic fields at a large range of temperatures. Thermal ionization of atmospheric species on the dayside of these planets results in charged particles becoming embedded in the planet's mostly neutral wind. The charges will resist flow across magnetic field lines as they are dragged around the planet and ultimately alter the circulation pattern of the atmosphere. We model this process to study this effect on high resolution emission and transmission spectra in order to identify observational signatures of the magnetic circulation regime that exist across multiple UHJs. Using a state-of-the-art kinematic MHD/active drag approach in a 3D atmospheric model, we simulate three different ultrahot Jupiters with and without magnetic effects. We post-process these models to generate high resolution emission and transmission spectra and explore trends in net Doppler shift as a function of phase. In emission spectra, we find that the net Doppler shift before and after secondary eclipse can be influenced by the presence of magnetic drag and wavelength choice. Trends in transmission spectra show our active drag models consistently produce a unique shape in their Doppler shift trends that differs from the models without active drag. This work is a critical theoretical step to understanding how magnetic fields shape the atmospheres of UHJs and provides some of the first predictions in high resolution spectroscopy for observing these effects.</description>

      <title>Stable stratification of the helium rain layer yields vastly different interiors and magnetic fields for Jupiter and Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At sufficiently high pressures (~Mbar) and low temperatures (~1e3-1eK), hydrogen and helium become partly immiscible. Interpretations of Jupiter and Saturn's magnetic fields favor the existence of a statically stable layer near the Mbar pressure level. From experimental and computational data for the hydrogen-helium phase diagram we find that moist convection and diffusive convection are inhibited, implying a stable helium rain layer in both Jupiter and Saturn. However, we find a significant difference in terms of structure and evolution: In Jupiter, helium settling leads to a stable yet super-adiabatic temperature gradient that is limited by conductive heat transport. The phase separation region should extend only a few tens of kilometers instead of thousands in current-day models, and be characterized by a sharp increase of the temperature of about 500K for standard phase separation diagrams. In Saturn, helium rains occurs much deeper, implying a larger helium flux relative to planetary mass. We find that the significant latent heat associated with helium condensation implies that a large fraction, perhaps close to 100%, of the planet's intrinsic heat flux may be locally transported by the sinking helium droplets. This implies that Saturn may possess a much more extended helium-rain region. This also accounts, at least qualitatively, for the differences in strength and characteristics of the magnetic fields of the two planets. Dedicated models of magnetic field generation in both planets may offer observational constraints to further refine these findings.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Directly Imaged Companion Hosts: I. Determination of diagnostic stellar abundances for planet formation and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of directly imaged planet host stars. The goal of the survey is the measurement of stellar properties and abundances of 15 elements (including C, O, and S) in these stars. In this work, we present the analysis procedure and the results for an initial set of five host stars, including some very well-known systems. We obtain C/O ratios using a combination of spectral modeling and equivalent width measurements for all five stars. Our analysis indicates solar C/O ratios for HR 8799 (0.59 $\pm$ 0.11), 51 Eri (0.54 $\pm$ 0.14), HD 984 (0.63 $\pm$ 0.14), and GJ 504 (0.54 $\pm$ 0.14). However, we find a super-solar C/O (0.81 $\pm$ 0.14) for HD 206893 through spectral modeling. The ratios obtained using the equivalent width method agree with those obtained using spectral modeling but have higher uncertainties ($\sim$0.3 dex). We also calculate the C/S and O/S ratios, which will help us to better constrain planet formation, especially once planetary sulfur abundances are measured using JWST. Lastly, we find no evidence of highly elevated metallicities or abundances for any of our targets, suggesting that a super metal-rich environment is not a prerequisite for large, widely separated gas planet formation. The measurement of elemental abundances beyond carbon and oxygen also provides access to additional abundance ratios, such as Mg/Si, which could aid in further modeling of their giant companions.</description>

      <title>Self-sustaining living habitats in extraterrestrial environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard definitions of habitability assume that life requires the presence of planetary gravity wells to stabilize liquid water and regulate surface temperature. Here the consequences of relaxing this assumption are evaluated. Temperature, pressure, volatile loss, radiation levels and nutrient availability all appear to be surmountable obstacles to the survival of photosynthetic life in space or on celestial bodies with thin atmospheres. Biologically generated barriers capable of transmitting visible radiation, blocking ultraviolet, and sustaining temperature gradients of 25-100 K and pressure differences of 10 kPa against the vacuum of space can allow habitable conditions between 1 and 5 astronomical units in the solar system. Hence ecosystems capable of generating conditions for their own survival are physically plausible, given the known capabilities of biological materials on Earth. Biogenic habitats for photosynthetic life in extraterrestrial environments would have major benefits for human life support and sustainability in space. Because the evolution of life elsewhere may have followed very different pathways from on Earth, living habitats could also exist outside traditional habitable environments around other stars, where they would have unusual but potentially detectable biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Partial disruption of a planet around a white dwarf: the effect of perturbation from the remnant planet on the accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 25\% -50\% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbation and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner plant would be partially disrupted periodically in the long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by the gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their falling toward the WD. The mass loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.</description>

      <title>The linear-mixing approximation in silica-water mixtures at planetary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Mixing Approximation (LMA) is often used in planetary models for calculating the equations of state (EoSs) of mixtures. A commonly assumed planetary composition is a mixture of rock and water. Here we assess the accuracy of the LMA for pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. We perform MD simulations using ab-initio simulations and consider pure-water, pure-silica, and 1:1 and 1:4 silica-water molecular fractions at temperature of 3000 K and pressures between 30 and 600 GPa. We find that the LMA is valid within a few percent (&lt;~5%) between ~150-600 Gpa, where the sign of the difference in inferred density depends on the specific composition of the mixture. We also show that the presence of rocks delays the transition to superionic water by ~70 GPa for the 1:4 silica-water mixture. Finally, we note that the choice of electronic theory (functionals) affect the EoS and introduces an uncertainty in of the order of 10% in density. Our study demonstrates the complexity of phase diagrams in planetary conditions and the need for a better understanding of rock-water mixtures and their effect on the inferred planetary composition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Planets near a 2:1 Resonance: Case Studies of Known and Synthetic Exosystems on a Grid of Initial Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of period ratios for 580 known two-planet systems is apparently nonuniform, with several sharp peaks and troughs. In particular, the vicinity of the 2:1 commensurability seems to have a deficit of systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirically inferred population distribution of period ratios, we prove that this apparent dearth of near-resonant systems is not statistically significant. The excess of systems with period ratios in the wider vicinity of the 2:1 resonance is significant, however. Long-term WHFast integrations of a synthetic two-planet system on a grid period ratios from 1.87 through 2.12 reveal that the eccentricity and inclination exchange mechanism between non-resonant planets represents the orbital evolution very well in all cases, except at the exact 2:1 mean motion resonance. This resonance destroys the orderly exchange of eccentricity, while the exchange of inclination still takes place. Additional simulations of the Kepler-113 system on a grid of initial inclinations show that the secular periods of eccentricity and inclination variations are well fitted by a simple hyperbolic cosine function of the initial mutual inclination. We further investigate the six known two-planet systems with period ratios within 2\% of the exact 2:1 resonance (TOI-216, KIC 5437945, Kepler-384, HD 82943, HD 73526, HD 155358) on a grid of initial inclinations and for two different initial periastron longitudes corresponding to the aligned and anti-aligned states. All these systems are found to be long-term stable except HD 73526, which is likely a false positive. The periodic orbital momentum exchange is still at work in some of these systems, albeit with much shorter cycling periods of a few years.</description>

      <title>Population of excited levels of Fe+, Ni+ and Cr+ in exocomets gaseous tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star Beta Pic is widely known for harbouring a large population of exocomets, which create variable absorption signatures in the stellar spectrum as they transit the star. While the physical and chemical properties of these objects have long remained elusive, Vrignaud et al. (2024) recently introduced the exocomet curve of growth approach, enabling, for the first time, the estimate of exocometary column densities and excitation temperature using absorption measurements in many spectral lines. Using this new tool, we present a refined study of a Beta Pic exocomet observed on December 6, 1997 with the HST. We first show that the comet's signature in FeII lines is well explained by the transit of two gaseous components, with different covering factors and opacities. Then, we show that the studied comet is detected in the lines of other species, such as NiII and CrII. These species are shown to experience similar physical conditions than FeII (same radial velocity profile, same excitation temperature), hinting that they are well-mixed. Finally, using almost 100 FeII lines rising from energy levels between 0 and 33000 cm-1, we derive the complete excitation diagram of Fe+ in the comet. The transiting gas is found to be populated at an excitation temperature of 8190+-160 K, very close to the stellar effective temperature (8052 K). Using a model of radiative and collisional excitation, we show that the observed excitation diagram is compatible with a radiative regime, associated with a close transit distance (&lt; 0.43 au) and a low electronic density (&lt; 1e7 cm-3). In this regime, the excitation of Fe+ is controlled by the stellar flux, and do not depend on the local electronic temperature or density. These results allow us to derive the Ni+/Fe+ and Cr+/Fe+ ratios in the December 6, 1997 comet, at 8.5 +- 0.8 x 10-2 and 1.04 +- 0.15 x 10-2 respectively, close to solar abundances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Machine Learning methods for the identification and localization of cometary activity for Solar System objects in ground and in space-based wide-field all-sky surveys. We will begin the chapter by discussing the challenges of identifying known and unknown active, extended Solar System objects in the presence of stellar-type sources and the application of classical pre-ML identification techniques and their limitations. We will then transition to the discussion of implementing ML techniques to address the challenge of extended object identification. We will finish with prospective future methods and the application to future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>The Palomar twilight survey of 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, Atiras, and comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-sun sky twilight observations allow for the detection of asteroid interior to the orbit of Venus (Aylos), the Earth (Atiras), and comets. We present the results of observations with the Palomar 48-inch telescope (P48)/Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera in 30 s r-band exposures taken during evening astronomical twilight from 2019 Sep 20 to 2022 March 7 and during morning astronomical twilight sky from 2019 Sep 21 to 2022 Sep 29. More than 46,000 exposures were taken in evening and morning astronomical twilight within 31 to 66 degrees from the Sun with an r-band limiting magnitude between 18.1 and 20.9. The twilight pointings show a slight seasonal dependence in limiting magnitude and ability to point closer towards the Sun, with limiting magnitude slightly improving during summer. In total, the one Aylo, (594913) 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, and 4 Atiras, 2020 OV1, 2021 BS1, 2021 PB2, and 2021 VR3, were discovered in evening and morning twilight observations. Additional twilight survey discoveries also include 6 long-period comets: C/2020 T2, C/2020 V2, C/2021 D2, C/2021 E3, C/2022 E3, and C/2022 P3, and two short-period comets: P/2021 N1 and P/2022 P2 using deep learning comet detection pipelines. The P48/ZTF twilight survey also recovered 11 known Atiras, one Aylo, three short-period comes, two long-period comets, and one interstellar object. Lastly, the Vera Rubin Observatory will conduct a twilight survey starting in its first year of operations and will cover the sky within 45 degrees of the Sun. Twilight surveys such as those by ZTF and future surveys will provide opportunities for discovering asteroids inside the orbits of Earth and Venus.</description>

Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>

Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>

Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07229</link>

Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>
