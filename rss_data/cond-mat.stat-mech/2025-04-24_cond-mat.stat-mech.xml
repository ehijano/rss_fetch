      <title>Exact steady states and fragmentation-induced relaxation in the no-passing asymmetric simple exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16363v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-species generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a ``no-passing" constraint, forbidding overtaking, on a one-dimensional open chain. This no-passing rule fragments the Hilbert space into an exponential number of disjoint sectors labeled by the particle sequence, leading to relaxation dynamics that depend sensitively on the initial ordering. We construct exact matrix-product steady states in every particle sequence sector and derive closed-form expressions for the particle-number distribution and two-point particle correlation functions. In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence. Our results uncover a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium metastability arising from Hilbert space fragmentation in exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and generalized Lifson-Jackson formula in quasi-periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion in periodic potentials has been widely investigated in statistical physics and related interdisciplinary fields. In the overdamped regime, it has been well-known that the diffusion constant $D^*$ is given by the Lifson-Jackson (LJ) formula. With a tilted potential, this model can exhibit giant diffusion. In this work, we start from the basic argument that since any quasi-periodic potential can be approximated accurately using a periodic potential, this formula and the associated physics should also apply to the quasi-periodic potential after some proper redefinition. We derive $D^*$ from the Smoluchowski equation using the fact that its asymptotic solution is a product of a Boltzmann weight and a Gaussian envelope function. Then we analytically calculate $D^*$ in terms of Bessel functions. Finally, we study the giant diffusion with quasi-periodic potentials, generalize the corresponding formula to the condition with tilted potential under the same argument, and calculate $D^*$ analytically. This work generalizes the Brownian motion from periodic potentials to the much broader quasi-periodic potentials, which should have applications in interdisciplinary fields in physics, chemistry, engineering, and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Random walks on random networks of cliques: Inferring the network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of discrete-time random walks on networks formed by randomly interconnected cliques, namely, random networks of cliques. Our purpose is to derive the parameters that define the network structure -- specifically, the distribution of clique size and the abundance of inter-clique links -- from the observation of selected statistical features along the random walk. To this end, we apply a Bayesian approach based on recording the times spent by the walker inside successively visited cliques. The procedure is illustrated with some numerical examples of diverse complexity, where the relevant structural parameters are successfully recovered.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered fractal spring network with active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of active bead-spring critical percolation clusters under the action of monopolar and dipolar forces. Previously, Langevin dynamics simulations of Rouse-type dynamics were performed on a deterministic fractal -- the Sierpinski gasket -- and combined with analytical theory [Chaos {\bf 34}, 113107 (2024)]. To study disordered fractals, we use here the critical (bond) percolation infinite cluster of square and triangular lattices, where beads (occupying nodes) are connected by harmonic springs. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as random telegraph processes, are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes, forming dipole links. A dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swelled for force monopoles. The time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at intermediate times longer than the force correlation time, whose anomalous exponent is solely controlled by the spectral dimension $(d_s)$ of the fractal network yielding MSD $\sim t^{\nu}$, with $\nu=1-\frac{d_s}{2}$, similar to the thermal system and in accord with the general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require a diverging time to reach a steady state, depending on the fraction of dipoles, and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state assumption, we find a saturation behavior at the same temporal regime. Thereafter, a second ballistic-like rise is observed for networks with a low fraction of dipole forces, followed by a linear, diffusive increase. The second ballistic rise is, however, absent in networks fully occupied with force dipoles. These two behaviors are argued to result from local rotations of nodes, which are either persistent or fluctuating.</description>

      <title>Self-organized fractal architectures driven by motility-dependent chemotactic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial patterns in biological systems often arise through self-organization without a central coordination, guided by local interactions and chemical signaling. In this study, we explore how motility-dependent chemical deposition and concentration-sensitive feedback can give rise to fractal-like networks, using a minimal agent-based model. Agents deposit chemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local chemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized structures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and epithelial cell dispersal. We identify a diverse phase diagram governed by the rates of chemical deposition and decay, revealing transitions from uniform distributions to sparse and dense networks, and ultimately to full phase separation. At low chemical decay rates, agents form stable, system-spanning networks; further reduction leads to re-entry into a uniform state. A continuum model capturing the co-evolution of agent density and chemical fields confirms these transitions and reveals how linear stability criteria determine the observed phases. At low chemical concentrations, diffusion dominates and promotes fractal growth, while higher concentrations favor nucleation and compact clustering. These findings unify a range of biological phenomena - such as chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, and self-generated gradient navigation - within a simple, physically grounded framework. Our results also offer insights into designing artificial systems with emergent collective behavior, including robotic swarms or synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Electronic Paddlewheels Impact the Dynamics of Superionic Conduction in AgI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state ion conductors hold promise as next generation battery materials. To realize their full potential, an understanding of atomic-scale ion conduction mechanisms is needed, including ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. Molecular simulations can create such an understanding, however, including a description of electronic structure necessitates computationally expensive methods that limit their application to small scales. We examine an alternative approach, in which neural network models are used to efficiently sample ionic configurations and dynamics at ab initio accuracy. Then, these configurations are used to determine electronic properties in a post-processing step. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the superionic phase of AgI, in which cation diffusion is coupled to rotational motion of local electron density on the surrounding iodide ions, termed electronic paddlewheels. The neural network potential can capture the many-body effects of electronic paddlewheels on ionic dynamics, but classical force field models cannot. Through an analysis rooted the generalized Langevin equation framework, we find that electronic paddlewheels have a significant impact on the time-dependent friction experienced by a mobile cation. Our approach will enable investigations of electronic fluctuations in materials on large length and time scales, and ultimately the control of ion dynamics through electronic paddlewheels.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit example, where the Hawking temperature of a black hole horizon is compatible with the black hole's R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic description, is constructed. It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived, where the Hawking temperature is identical with the R\'enyi temperature, i.e. the one obtained from the R\'enyi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of thermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely determined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the R\'enyi parameter, {\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by which preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).</description>

      <title>Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $\phi^{2n}$ theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\phi^{2n}$ deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The generalized free theories refer to the $\Box^k$ free scalar theories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the multicritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the (generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal symmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Emergent complex phases in a discrete flocking model with reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in multi-species active matter systems with reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions. While such interactions have been explored in continuous symmetry models, less is known about multi-species discrete-symmetry systems. To address this, we study the two-species active Ising model (TSAIM), a discrete counterpart of the two-species Vicsek model. Our investigation explores both inter-species reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions, along with the possibility of species interconversion. In the reciprocal TSAIM, we observe the emergence of a high-density parallel flocking state, a feature not seen in previous flocking models. With species interconversion, the TSAIM corresponds to an active extension of the Ashkin-Teller model and exhibits rich state diagrams. In the non-reciprocal TSAIM, a run-and-chase dynamics emerge. We also find that the system is metastable due to droplet excitation and exhibits spontaneous motility-induced interface pinning. A hydrodynamic theory validates our numerical simulations and confirms the phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Universality of percolation at dynamic pseudocritical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universality, encompassing critical exponents, scaling functions, and dimensionless quantities, is fundamental to phase transition theory. In finite systems, universal behaviors are also expected to emerge at the pseudocritical point. Focusing on two-dimensional percolation, we show that the size distribution of the largest cluster asymptotically approaches to a Gumbel form in the subcritical phase, a Gaussian form in the supercritical phase, and transitions within the critical finite-size scaling window. Numerical results indicate that, at consistently defined pseudocritical points, this distribution exhibits a universal form across various lattices and percolation models (bond or site), within error bars, yet differs from the distribution at the critical point. The critical polynomial, universally zero for two-dimensional percolation at the critical point, becomes nonzero at pseudocritical points. Nevertheless, numerical evidence suggests that the critical polynomial, along with other dimensionless quantities such as wrapping probabilities and Binder cumulants, assumes fixed values at the pseudocritical point that are independent of the percolation type (bond or site) but vary with lattice structures. These findings imply that while strict universality breaks down at the pseudocritical point, certain extreme-value statistics and dimensionless quantities exhibit quasi-universality, revealing a subtle connection between scaling behaviors at critical and pseudocritical points.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.</description>

      <title>A simple and accurate method to determine fluid-crystal phase boundaries from direct coexistence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One method for computationally determining phase boundaries is to explicitly simulate a direct coexistence between the two phases of interest. Although this approach works very well for fluid-fluid coexistences, it is often considered to be less useful for fluid-crystal transitions, as additional care must be taken to prevent the simulation boundaries from imposing unwanted strains on the crystal phase. Here, we present a simple adaptation to the direct coexistence method that nonetheless allows us to obtain highly accurate predictions of fluid-crystal coexistence conditions, assuming a fluid-crystal interface can be readily simulated. We test our approach on hard spheres, the screened Coulomb potential, and a 2D patchy-particle model. In all cases, we find excellent agreement between the direct coexistence approach and (much more cumbersome) free-energy calculation methods. Moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to resolve the (tiny) free-energy difference between the face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed crystal of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit. The simplicity of this method also ensures that it can be trivially implemented in essentially any simulation method or package. Hence, this approach provides an excellent alternative to free-energy based methods for the precise determination of phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>Monitored long-range interacting systems: spin-wave theory for quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phases exhibit unconventional dynamics as emergent collective phenomena, yet their behavior in tailored interacting systems -- crucial for quantum technologies -- remains less understood. We develop a systematic toolbox to analyze monitored dynamics in long-range interacting systems, relevant to platforms like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. Our method extends spin-wave theory to general dynamical generators at the quantum trajectory level, enabling access to a broader class of states than approaches based on density matrices. This allows efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins and captures nonlinear dynamical features such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring entanglement phase transitions in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions in one and two dimensions, where the entanglement scaling changes from logarithm to volume law as the interaction range shortens, and by dwelling on how our method mitigates experimental post-selection challenges in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Negative thermodynamic pressure: no-go theorem and yes-go examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory and experiment have long discussed negative thermodynamic pressure states, but their microscopic origins are unclear. I address this problem within the framework of quantum thermodynamics. I show that the pressure exerted on the boundary is positive when there is no interaction with the boundary. This is formalized by a no-go theorem that holds for any quantum state with finite motion. As a consequence of this analysis, I deduce a general formula for quantum non-equilibrium pressure. It is believed that stable negative pressure states cannot exist in gases. I provide solvable examples of quantum and classical gases, where negative pressure is achieved due to a suitable coupling with the boundary walls.</description>

      <title>First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.</description>

      <title>The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>
