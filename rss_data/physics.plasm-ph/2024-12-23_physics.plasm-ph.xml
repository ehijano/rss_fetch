      <title>Second harmonic generation by radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical study of second harmonic generation due to the interaction of radially polarized laser beam with homogeneous and unmagnetized plasma is presented. The analytical study is based on Lorentz force, continuity and electromagnetic wave equations. Amplitude of second harmonic radiation is derived with the help of current density and dispersion relation obtained at twice the fundamental frequency of the laser field. Perturbation technique is used for evaluation of current density. The variation of amplitude and efficiency of radially polarized second harmonic radiation with propagation distance is graphically depicted. It is seen that radially polarized laser propagating in plasma gives efficient second harmonic radiation generation.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency fast pinching radiation of electron beams in nonuniform plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous development of bright x/gamma-ray sources has opened up new frontiers of science and advanced applications. Currently, there is still a lack of efficient approaches to produce gamma-rays with photon energies up to GeV and with high peak brilliance comparable to modern free-electron lasers. Here we report a novel mechanism called beam fast pinching radiation burst to generate such gamma-ray sources. It is achieved by injecting a GeV electron beam into a submillimeter plasma with an upramp density profile, enabling violent beam pinching to occur rapidly. During this process, a burst of collimated gamma-rays is efficiently produced with photon energy up to GeV, energy conversion efficiency exceeding $30\%$, and peak brilliance exceeding $10^{28}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mm$^{-2}$ mrad$^{-2}$ per $0.1\%$ bandwidth. All of these are several orders of magnitude higher than existing gamma-ray sources. This opens a novel avenue for the development of extremely bright gamma-ray sources for both fundamental research and cutting-edge applications.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic particle-in-cell modeling of an electron cyclotron resonance plasma discharge in hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low pressure discharge sustained in molecular hydrogen with help of the electron cyclotron resonance heating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is simulated using a fully electromagnetic implicit charge- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo code. The simulations show a number of kinetic effects, and the results are in good agreement with various experimentally measured data such as electron density, electron temperature and degree of dissociation. The electron energy distribution shows a tri-Maxwellian form due to a number of different electron heating mechanisms, agreeing with the experimental data in the measured electron energy interval. The simulation results are also verified against a drift-diffusion model and proximity is observed between the computational results for the plasma density at the location of experimental measurement. However, the fluid approximation fails to accurately predict radical density and electron temperature because of the assumption of a single electron temperature. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of hydrogen radicals, whose production is strongly underestimated by the fluid model, whereas it is well predicted by the model considered here. The energy distribution of such radicals demonstrates the presence of a relatively large number of energetic hydrogen atoms produced by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The new insights are of significance for practical applications of hydrogen plasmas.</description>

      <title>3D non-linear non-adiabatic MHD simulations of core density collapse event in LHD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new three-dimensional, non-linear, non-adiabatic Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model has been implemented in MIPS code, which takes into account the parallel heat diffusivity. The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model used in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC) observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the new model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for axis beta=4% plasma with a steep pressure gradient, which makes the plasma potentially unstable in the LHD. The model can show preliminary characteristics of the CDC event. The work is extended to analyze the effect of an external heating source on the CDC event. An external heat source centered at the core of the plasma triggers the CDC event earlier than the time of spontaneous CDC, caused by the increase in pressure gradient steepness. The amplitude and geometry of the heat source have been observed to have an effect on the MHD stability.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasmoid drifts on the pellet rocket effect in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail here a semi-analytical model for the pellet rocket effect, which describes the acceleration of pellets in a fusion plasma due to asymmetries in the heat flux reaching the pellet surface and the corresponding ablation rate. This effect was shown in experiments to significantly modify the pellet trajectory, and projections for reactor scale devices indicate that it may severely limit the effectiveness of pellet injection methods. We account for asymmetries stemming both from plasma parameter gradients and an asymmetric plasmoid shielding caused by the drift of the ionized pellet cloud. For high temperature, reactor relevant scenarios, we find a wide range of initial pellet sizes and speeds where the rocket effect severely limits the penetration depth of the pellet. In these cases, the plasma parameter profile variations dominate the rocket effect. We find that for small and fast pellets, where the rocket effect is less pronounced, plasmoid shielding induced asymmetries dominate.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential of the warm dense electron gas from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation results for the chemical potential of the warm dense uniform electron gas (UEG), spanning a broad range of densities and temperatures. This is achieved by following two independent routes, i) based on the direct estimation of the free energy [Dornheim \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2407.01044] and ii) using a histogram estimator in PIMC simulations with a varying number of particles. We empirically confirm the expected inverse linear dependence of the exchange--correlation (XC) part of the chemical potential on the simulated number of electrons, which allows for a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit without the necessity for an additional finite-size correction. We find very good agreement (within $\Delta\mu_\textnormal{xc}\lesssim0.5\%$) with the previous parametrization of the XC-free energy by Groth \emph{et al.}~[\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)], which constitutes an important cross validation of current state-of-the-art UEG equations of state. In addition to being interesting in its own right, our study constitutes the basis for the future PIMC based investigation of the chemical potential of real warm dense matter systems starting with hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Propagation of untwisting solar jets from the low-beta corona into the super-Alfv\'enic wind: Testing a solar origin scenario for switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs), localised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest in uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in the lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to solar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and solar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and helicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind, assesses the impact of distinct Parker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced magnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed parametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the self-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation of solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\beta$ and Alfv\'en velocity profiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent coronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind. Notable structures such as the leading Alfv\'enic wave and trailing dense-jet region were consistently observed across diverse plasma $\beta$ atmospheres. The jet propagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations, with changes in Alfv\'en velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and propagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at jet onset, do not persist in the low-$\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting waves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs were not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs in the sub-Alfv\'enic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic deflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation processes.</description>

      <title>Foreshock Ultra-Low Frequency Waves at Mars: Consequence on the Particle Acceleration Mechanisms at the Martian Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33 \pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.</description>

      <title>A transformational approach to collective behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization, forecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble of conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are determined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many different forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a collective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary particles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory builds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach recognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that is the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the canonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also known as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new theory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the collective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster Expansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a localized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the singularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group Equations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the stochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective systems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details of a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>
