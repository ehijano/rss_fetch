      <title>A taxonomy of categories for relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10323v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. This paper strives to provide a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'', including their enriched version, further showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The resulting taxonomy aims at bringing clarity and organisation to the numerous related concepts and frameworks occurring in the literature</description>

      <title>Generalised Process Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of an abelian category via premonoform objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\cA$ be an abelian category. In this paper, we study ${\rm (n)PSpec}\cA$, a topological space formed by equivalence classes derived from an equivalence relation on (noetherian) premonoform objects. We classify torsion classes of $\cA$ via closed subclasses of $\nPSpec\cA$. We introduce a new topology on $\PSpec\cA$ and we classify Serre subcategories of $\noeth A$ and localizing subcategories of $\cA$ using this topology. If $A$ is a commutative noetherian ring, we show that $\nPSpec A$ is homeomorphic to $\Spec A$. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the closed subsets of $\nPSpec A$ and the open subsets of $\ASpec A$, the atom spectrum of $A$. Finally, we explore the relationships between the new subctegories of $\Mod A$ and subsets of $\nPSpec A$ introduced in this paper, and the known subcategories of $\Mod A$ and subsets of other spectra of $A$.</description>
