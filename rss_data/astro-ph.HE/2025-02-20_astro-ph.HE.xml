      <title>Segregation in Nuclear Stellar Clusters: Rates and Mass Distributions of TDEs, QPEs, Plunges, and EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass black holes, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass black holes, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 10$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass black holes, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier black holes, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier black holes to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the variable optical counterpart of the redback pulsar PSR J2055+1545</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the variable optical counterpart to PSR J2055+1545, a redback millisecond pulsar, and the first radial velocity curve of its companion star. The multi-band optical light curves of this system show a $0.4$$-$$0.6 \ \mathrm{mag}$ amplitude modulation with a single peak per orbit and variable colours, suggesting that the companion is mildly irradiated by the pulsar wind. We find that the flux maximum is asymmetric and occurs at orbital phase $\simeq0.4$, anticipating the superior conjunction of the companion (where the optical emission of irradiated redback companions is typically brightest). We ascribe this asymmetry, well fit with a hot spot in our light curve modelling, to irradiation from the intrabinary shock between pulsar and companion winds. The optical spectra obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} reveal a G-dwarf companion star with temperatures of $5749 \pm 34 \ \mathrm{K}$ and $6106 \pm 35 \ \mathrm{K}$ at its inferior and superior orbital conjunctions, respectively, and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of $385 \pm 3 \ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Our best-fit model yields a neutron star mass of $1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \ \mathrm{M_{sun}}$ and a companion mass of $0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.01} \ \mathrm{M_{sun}}$. Based on the close similarity between the optical light curve of PSR~J2055$+$1545 and those observed from PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1227-4853 during their rotation-powered states, we suggest this system may develop an accretion disc in the future and manifest as a transitional millisecond pulsar.</description>

      <title>Radio observations of the ultra-long GRB 220627A reveal a hot cocoon supporting the blue supergiant progenitor scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the most distant ultra-long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected to date, GRB~220627A at redshift $z=3.084$. Its prompt gamma-ray light curve shows a double-pulse profile, with the pulses separated by a period of quiescence lasting ${\sim} 15\,$min, leading to early speculation it could be a strongly gravitationally lensed GRB. However, our analysis of the $\textit{Fermi}$/GBM spectra taken during the time intervals of both pulses show clear differences in their spectral energy distributions, disfavouring the lensing scenario. We observed the radio afterglow from $7$ to $456\,$d post-burst: an initial, steep decay ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-2}$) is followed by a shallower decline ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-1/2}$) after ${\sim} 20\,$d. Our afterglow modelling shows that these radio properties can be explained by the presence of a slow, wide ejecta component in addition to a fast, narrow ejecta component, consistent with the picture of a highly-collimated jet and its thermal cocoon decelerating into the ambient medium. The properties of the cocoon point toward a progenitor with a large stellar radius, supporting the blue supergiant scenario proposed for ultra-long GRBs. We also conducted an independent test of the lensing hypothesis via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at ${\sim} 12\,$d post-burst by searching, for the first time, for multiple images of the candidate lensed GRB afterglow. Our experiment highlighted the growing need for developments in real-time correlation capabilities for time-critical VLBI experiments, particularly as we advance towards the SKA and ngVLA era of radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation in Core Collapse Supernova: The Impact of Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova is a topic of active research. The core of a supernova is an intense source of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Self-interaction among neutrinos (as well as antineutrinos) gives rise to a rich phenomenology not seen in terrestrial situations. In studies of the dynamics of flavor evolution in such environments, the gravitational effects are generally ignored. Although the curvature outside a dense core does not deviate much from a flat space, the spin of the neutrinos can still couple to the torsion of the spacetime. These extra degrees of freedom of curved spacetime have interaction strengths that are proportional to the density of the neutrinos and the other fermions \cite{Chakrabarty:2019cau} \cite{Barick:2023qjq} as well as the coupling constants of the spin-torsion interaction. We have studied the effects of such interactions in flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova \cite{Ghose:Manuscript}. The self-interaction gets modified by the spin-torsion interaction and the oscillation dynamics is modified. We have seen that there are noticeable changes in the flavor dynamics when the neutrino density is uniform. We have also studied the effects of such interaction in a realistic core-collapse supernova (CCSN). As neutrino astronomy enters the precision era, this study will shed light on the potential of neutrino fluxes from CCSN to probe the neutrino-neutrino interaction.</description>

      <title>Cross-Comparison of Sampling Algorithms for Pulse Profile Modeling of PSR J0740+6620</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, NICER data has enabled mass and radius inferences for various pulsars, and thus shed light on the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. This is achieved through a technique called pulse profile modeling. The importance of the results necessitates careful validation and testing of the robustness of the inference procedure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of sampler choice for X-PSI (X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference), an open-source package for pulse profile modeling and Bayesian statistical inference that has been used extensively for analysis of NICER data. We focus on the specific case of the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620. Using synthetic data that mimics the most recently analyzed NICER and XMM-Newton data sets of PSR J0740+6620, we evaluate the parameter recovery performance, convergence, and computational cost for MultiNest's multimodal nested sampling algorithm and UltraNest's slice nested sampling algorithm. We find that both samplers perform reliably, producing accurate and unbiased parameter estimation results when analyzing simulated data. We also investigate the consequences for inference using the real data for PSR J0740+6620, finding that both samplers produce consistent credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance from the event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is the cornerstone of relativity theory. Its implications have been verified experimentally with a variety of approaches. The detection of a muon at extremely high energy detected by the ARCA detector in the Mediterranean sea, the most energetic particle directly measured up to date, allows to put additional constraints on Lorentz non-invariant theories. The prediction of some of those theories is that the lifetimes of particles in the laboratory frame 'decrease' rather than 'increase' with increasing $\gamma$. In this frame the sheer fact that the muon traversed the whole ARCA detector puts a lower limit on the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame, that implies upper limits on Lorentz violating parameters.</description>

      <title>NGC 3259: A Signal for an Untapped Population of Slowly Accreting Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a central challenge in modern cosmology. To date only small samples of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^5M_{\odot}$) and 'lesser' supermassive black holes (LSMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^6M_{\odot}$) have been identified. Our present study of NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph complemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations demonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC 3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\times10^5M_{\odot}$, inferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the Eddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy NGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\alpha$ profile that is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR) clouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical power-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot corona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could only detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC 3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25 times lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this galaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways for the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence of a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys will detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future X-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.</description>

      <title>The XMAGNET exascale MHD simulations of SMBH feedback in galaxy groups and clusters: Overview and preliminary cluster results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bayesian Optimization for Atomic Structure Calculations of Heavy Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel optimisation technique for atomic structure calculations using the Flexible Atomic Code, focussing on complex multielectron systems relevant to $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova modelling. We introduce a method to optimise the fictitious mean configuration used in the Flexible Atomic Code, significantly improving the accuracy of calculated energy levels and transition properties for lanthanide and actinide ions. Our approach employs a Sequential Model-Based Optimisation algorithm to refine the fictitious mean configuration, iteratively minimising the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined energy levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through detailed analyses of Au II, Pt II, Pr II, Pr III, Er II, and Er~III, representing a broad range of atomic configurations. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the calculated energy levels, with average relative differences to the NIST data reduced from 20-60\% to 10\% or less for the ions studied. Transition wavelength calculations exhibit exceptional agreement with experimental data, with about 90\% of the calculated values falling within 10\% of measurements for Pr and Er ions. While improvements in transition probability calculations are observed, the calculated transition probabilities (log($gf$) values) still show significant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root mean square deviations of approximately 1.1-1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions. We extend our optimisation technique to systematic calculations of singly and doubly ionised lanthanides, achieving accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of \textit{ab-initio} atomic structure codes. The method's broad applicability across the lanthanide series demonstrates its potential for enhancing opacity calculations and spectral modelling in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Dyonic black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of EAS directions based on TAIGA HiSCORE data using fully connected neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direction of extensive air showers can be used to determine the source of gamma quanta and plays an important role in estimating the energy of the primary particle. The data from an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detector stations HiSCORE in the TAIGA experiment registering the number of photoelectrons and detection time can be used to estimate the shower direction with high accuracy. In this work, we use artificial neural networks trained on Monte Carlo-simulated TAIGA HiSCORE data for gamma quanta to obtain shower direction estimates. The neural networks are multilayer perceptrons with skip connections using partial data from several HiSCORE stations as inputs; composite estimates are derived from multiple individual estimates by the neural networks. We apply a two-stage algorithm in which the direction estimates obtained in the first stage are used to transform the input data and refine the estimates. The mean error of the final estimates is less than 0.25 degrees. The approach will be used for multimodal analysis of the data from several types of detectors used in the TAIGA experiment.</description>

      <title>Lowest-mass X-ray selected AGNs in the Bo\"otes Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass galaxies in the Bo\"otes field with the aim of improving constraints on the occupation fraction of low-mass black holes (BHs). Galaxies with low stellar masses ($M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain BHs that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early Universe. Using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous low-mass galaxies and assess whether they host AGNs. We find one of these sources to be variable in the X-ray and compute its X-ray light curve and spectrum. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established AGN luminosity relationships in the literature. We then fit various star-forming, dust emission, and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The star formation rates estimated from the SED fits are unable to explain the observed X-ray luminosities of the candidates, providing more support for the presence of AGNs. By analysing the deviation from linear relationships between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosities, we find these systems to be obscured (with $\log N_{\rm H}[{\rm {cm^{-2}}}] \sim 22.7, &gt; 25.0$, and $24.4$, respectively). We employ the scaling relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion to estimate the BH masses as $\sim 10^5 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and accreting at Eddington ratios $10^{-2} &lt; \lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Connecting GRBs from Binary Neutron Star Mergers to Nuclear Properties of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fate of the binary neutron star (NS) merger remnants hinges sensitively upon the NS equation of state and the threshold mass, $M_{\rm ls}$, that separates a long-lived from a short-lived NS remnant. The nature of the electromagnetic counterparts is also influenced by the remnant type, particularly in determining whether a gamma-ray burst from a compact binary merger (cbGRB) is of short or long duration. We propose a novel approach to probe $M_{\rm ls}$ by linking it to the estimated observed ratio of long to short cbGRBs. We find that current observations broadly favour a relatively high value for this transition, $M_{\rm ls}\simeq 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$, for which $ M_{\rm TOV} \lesssim 2.6\,M_\odot $, consistent with numerical simulations, as also shown here. Our results disfavour nuclear physics scenarios that would lead to catastrophic pressure loss at a few times nuclear density and temperatures of tens of MeV, leading to a rapid gravitational collapse of binaries with total mass $M \lesssim 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$. Future individual gravitational wave events with on-axis cbGRBs can further bound $M_{\rm ls}$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating newborn magnetars, which originate from binary neutron star (NS) mergers and serve as the central engines of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may leave some imprints on their prompt gamma-ray light curves even though they are far from their radiating fireballs. A high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) would be a unique feature for the magnetar central engine, especially a hypermassive magnetar. By conducting a systematic analysis of the prompt gamma-ray light curves from 605 short GRBs observed by {\em Fermi}/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, we have identified such QPO signals in three GRBs (e.g. GRB 120323A, GRB 181222B, and GRB 190606A). The QPOs that peaked at $1258^{+6}_{-6}$ Hz for GRB 120323A, $623^{+4}_{-4}$ Hz for GRB 181222B, and $1410^{+4}_{-5}$ Hz for GRB 190606A are all with a confidence level above 5.2 $\sigma$. The high-frequency QPO signals of those three short GRBs may be caused by a hypermassive magnetar acting as the central engine in a binary NS merger of a binary NS.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deriving Pseudo-Redshifts of Gamma-ray Bursts from Two Phenomenological Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshifts is essential for studying their intrinsic properties and exploring their potential application in cosmology. Currently, only a small fraction of GRBs have independent redshift measurements, primarily due to the need of rapid follow-up optical/IR spectroscopic observations. For this reason, many have utilized phenomenological correlations to derive pseudo-redshifts of GRBs with no redshift measurement. In this work, we explore the feasibility of analytically deriving pseudo-redshifts directly from the Amati and Yonetoku relations. We simulate populations of GRBs that (i) fall perfectly on the phenomenological correlation track, and (ii) include intrinsic scatter matching observations. Our findings indicate that, in the case of the Amati relation , the mathematical formulation is ill-behaved so that it yields two solutions within a reasonable redshift range $z \in [0.1, 10] $. When realistic scatter is included, it may result in no solution, or the redshift error range is excessively large. In the case of the Yonetoku relation, while it can result in a unique solution in most cases, the large systematic errors of the redshift calls for attention, especially when attempting to use pseudo redshifts to study GRB population properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Axion-Like Particle from observation of FSRQ Ton 599 by Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High energy photons traveling through astrophysical magnetic fields have the potential to undergo oscillations with axion-like particles (ALPs), resulting in modifications to the observed photon spectrum. High energy $\gamma-$ray sources with significant magnetic field strengths provide an ideal setting to investigate this phenomenon. Ton 599, a flat spectrum radio quasar with a magnetic field strength on the order of Gauss in its emission region, presents a promising opportunity for studying ALP-photon oscillations. In this study, we analyze the effects of ALP-photon oscillations on the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Ton 599 as observed by Fermi-LAT. Our investigation considers the potential influences of the broad-line region and dusty torus on the $\gamma-$ray spectrum of Ton 599. We set the constraints on the ALP parameters at the $95\%$ confidence level, and find that the constraints on \(g_{a\gamma}\) can reach approximately \(2 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\) for \(m_a \sim 10^{9}~\mathrm{eV}\).</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter.~The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum.~In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars.~We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda_{n=1} = 5.4 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_{n=2} = 3.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetry in Dense Matter with Meson Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>
