      <title>Radio afterglows from tidal disruption events: An unbiased sample from ASKAP RACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-time ($\sim$ year) radio follow-up of optically-discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of sub-relativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multi-epoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically-discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742-1032\,MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000\,days for some events. Overall, we find that at least $22^{+15}_{-11}$\% of the population of optically-discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (2 epochs separated by $\sim 3\,$ years) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence ($\sim 2$\,months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients (VAST) survey can detect $\sim 20$ TDEs in its operational span (4\,yrs), given the current rate from optical surveys.</description>

      <title>Influences of modified Chaplygin dark fluid around a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCGMBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCGMBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCGMBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCGMBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical BH.</description>

      <title>An emission state switching radio transient with a 54 minute period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients are an emerging class of extreme astrophysical events of which only three are known. These objects emit highly polarised, coherent pulses of typically a few tens of seconds duration and minutes to hour-long periods. While magnetic white dwarfs and magnetars, either isolated or in binary systems, have been invoked to explain these objects, a consensus has not emerged. Here we report on the discovery of ASKAP J193505.1+214841.0 (henceforth ASKAPJ1935+2148) with a period of 53.8 minutes exhibiting three distinct emission states - a bright pulse state with highly linearly polarised pulses with widths of 10-50 seconds; a weak pulse state which is about 26 times fainter than the bright state with highly circularly polarised pulses of widths of approximately 370 milliseconds; and a quiescent or quenched state with no pulses. The first two states have been observed to progressively evolve over the course of 8 months with the quenched state interspersed between them suggesting physical changes in the region producing the emission. A constraint on the radius of the source for the observed period rules out a magnetic white dwarf origin. Unlike other long-period sources, ASKAPJ1935+2148 is the first to exhibit drastic variations in emission modes reminiscent of neutron stars. However, its radio properties challenge our current understanding of neutron star emission and evolution.</description>

      <title>Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (&gt; ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.</description>

      <title>Shock cooling emission from explosions of massive stars: III. Blue Super Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light emission in the first hours and days following core-collapse supernovae is dominated by the escape of photons from the expanding shock-heated envelope. In preceding papers, we provided a simple analytic description of the time-dependent luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, as well as of the small ($\simeq10\%$) deviations of the spectrum from blackbody at low frequencies, $h\nu&lt; 3T_{\rm col}$, and of `line dampening' at $h\nu&gt; 3T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants (RSGs) with convective polytropic envelopes (without significant circum-stellar medium). Here, we extend our work to provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with radiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the numeric $L$ and $T_{\rm col}$ to within 10\% and 5\% accuracy, and the spectral energy distribution to within $\sim20-40\%$. The accuracy is similar to that achieved for RSG explosions.</description>

      <title>GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2: GRB observations with CubeSats after 3 years of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a sun-synchronous LEO at an altitude of 550 km to perform an in-orbit demonstration of a novel gamma-ray burst detector developed for CubeSats. VZLUSAT-2 followed ten months later in a similar orbit carrying as a secondary payload a pair of identical detectors as used on the first mission. These instruments detecting gamma-rays in the range of 30-900 keV consist of a 56 cm2 5 mm thin CsI(Tl) scintillator read-out by a row of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPC or SiPM). The scientific motivation is to detect gamma-ray bursts and other HE transient events and serve as a pathfinder for a larger constellation of nanosatellites that could localize these events via triangulation.
  At the beginning of July 2024, GRBAlpha detected 140 such transients, while VZLUSAT-2 had 83 positive detections, confirmed by larger GRB missions. Almost a hundred of them are identified as gamma-ray bursts, including extremely bright GRB 221009A and GRB 230307A, detected by both satellites. We were able to characterize the degradation of SiPMs in polar orbit and optimize the duty cycle of the detector system also by using SatNOGS radio network for downlink.</description>

      <title>Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.2\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

      <title>eROSITA (eRASS1) study of Canis Major overdensity: Developing a multi-wavelength algorithm for the classification of faint X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is a candidate for the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that is merging to the Milky Way disk. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Long term wide-band spectro-temporal studies of outbursting black hole candidate sources GX 339-4 and H 1743-322: AstroSat and NuSTAR results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analyses of recurrent outbursting black hole sources GX 339$-$4 and H 1743$-$322 using available AstroSat and NuSTAR archival observations during 2016-2024. The nature of the outburst profiles of both sources are examined using long-term MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT lightcurves, and failed as well as successful outbursts are classified. Wide-band (0.5-60 keV) spectral modelling with disc (diskbb) and Comptonized (Nthcomp) components indicates that GX 339-4 transits from hard ($kT_{bb}=0.12-0.77$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.54-1.74$ and $L_{bol}=0.91-11.56$\% $L_{Edd}$) to soft state ($kT_{in}~[\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.82-0.88$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.46-3.26$, $L_{bol}=19.59-30.06\%L_{Edd}$) via intermediate state ($kT_{in}~[\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.56-0.88$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.76-2.66$, $L_{bol}=2.90-16.09\%L_{Edd}$), whereas H 1743-322 transits from quiescent to hard state ($\Gamma_{nth}=1.57-1.71$, $L_{bol}=2.08-3.48\%L_{Edd}$). We observe type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in GX 339-4 with increasing frequencies ($0.10-5.37$ Hz) along with harmonics. For H 1743-322, prominent type-C QPOs are observed in frequency range 0.22-1.01 Hz along with distinct harmonics. Energy-dependent power spectral studies reveal that fundamental QPO and harmonics disappear beyond 20 keV in GX 339-4, whereas fundamental QPO in H 1743-322 persists up to 40 keV. We also observe that type-C $QPO_{rms}\%$ decreases with energy for both sources although such variations appear marginal for type-B QPOs. Additionally, we report non-monotonic behavior of photon index with plasma temperature and detection of annihilation line. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the observational findings in the context of accretion dynamics around black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Crab X-ray Polarization using Deeper IXPE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Crab X-ray polarization measurements using IXPE data with a total exposure of 300ks, three times more than the initial 2022 discovery paper. Polarization is detected in three times more pulsar phase bins, revealing an S-shaped $+40^\circ$ polarization angle sweep in the main pulse and ${&gt;}1\sigma$ departures from the OPTIMA optical polarization in both pulses, suggesting different radiation mechanisms or sites for the polarized emission at the two wavebands. Our polarization map of the inner nebula reveals a toroidal magnetic field, as seen in prior IXPE analyses. Along the southern jet, the magnetic field orientation relative to the jet axis changes from perpendicular to parallel and the polarization degree decreases by ${\sim}6\%$. These observations may be explained by kink instabilities along the jet or a collision with a dense, jet-deflecting medium at the tip. Using spectropolarimetric analysis, we find asymmetric polarization in the four quadrants of the inner nebula, as expected for a toroidal field geometry, and a spatial correlation between polarization degree and photon index.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two universal predictions of general relativity are the propagation of gravitational waves of large momentum along null geodesics and the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in many families of black holes. In extensions of general relativity, these properties are typically lost: quasinormal modes are no longer isospectral and gravitational wave propagation is no longer geodesic and it exhibits birefringence -- polarization-dependent speed. We study these effects in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with up to eight-derivative terms and show that there is a unique Lagrangian that has a non-birefringent dispersion relation for gravitational waves and isospectral quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit. We argue that both properties are related through a generalized correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and unstable photon-sphere orbits. These properties define a special class of theories that we denote as isospectral effective field theories. We note that the lowest-order isospectral correction to general relativity coincides with the quartic-curvature correction arising from type II string theory, suggesting that isospectrality might be a key feature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Charged Particles Capture Cross-Section by a Weakly Charged Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the capture cross-section of charged particles by a weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole. The dependence of the maximum impact parameter for capture on the particle's energy is investigated numerically for different values of the electromagnetic coupling strength between the particle and the black hole. The capture cross-section is then calculated. We show that the capture cross-section is independent of the electromagnetic coupling for ultra-relativistic particles. The astrophysical implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Under the most favorable conditions, the upper limit may suggest $\omega_{\rm BD} &gt; 816$. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds arising from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, setting upper limits on scalar backgrounds expected to be two orders of magnitude lower than the total background contributed by both BBH and BNS in one year of observational data. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain Brans-Dicke gravity. However, the future detection of a potential scalar background within the AGWB could provide significant support for gravity theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of 2SC quark matter in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense, neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes. The quark matter is modeled using Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model improved to account for vector and t'Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1 to 10\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the post-merger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted in nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. XI. Radio source catalog IV: $2^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 28^\circ$, $36^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 60^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 1^\circ$</title>

Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes of NSs are an exciting prospect for analyzing the internal composition of NSs and studying matter at high densities. In this work, we focus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple with gravitational waves. We construct two different EOS ensembles, one without and one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes might help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions in the $65\%$ and $95\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time relations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order oscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are beyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The quasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective in differentiating the EOS ensembles, as they obscure the details of the EOS.</description>

      <title>STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Tertiary-induced Binary Black Hole Mergers: the Role of Superthermal Wide Tertiary Eccentricity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis $\gtrsim10^3\;\mathrm{AU}$) observed by \emph{Gaia} tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution ($P(e) \propto e$) -- such distributions are termed "superthermal". Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying $a_{\rm in}/a_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.005$ (where $a_{\rm in}$ and $a_{\rm out}$ are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions, as the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Progenitor and explosion properties of SN 2023ixf estimated based on a light-curve model grid of Type II supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the progenitor and explosion properties of the nearby Type II SN 2023ixf using a synthetic model grid of Type II supernova light curves. By comparing the light curves of SN 2023ixf with the pre-existing grid of Type II supernovae containing about 228,000 models with different combinations of the progenitor and explosion properties, we obtain the chi2 value for every model and evaluate the properties of the models providing small values of chi2. We found that the light-curve models with the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of 10 Msun, the explosion energy of (2-3)e51 erg, the 56Ni mass of 0.04-0.06 Msun, the mass-loss rate of 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr with a wind velocity of 10 km/s, and the dense, confined circumstellar matter radius of (6-10)e14 cm match well to the observed light curves of SN 2023ixf. The photospheric velocity evolution of these models is also consistent with the observed velocity evolution. We note that the progenitor mass estimate could be affected by the adopted progenitor models. Although our parameter estimation is based on a pre-existing model grid and we do not perform any additional computations, the estimated parameters are consistent with those obtained by the detailed modeling of SN 2023ixf previously reported. This result shows that comparing the pre-existing model grid is a reasonable way to obtain a rough estimate for the properties of Type II supernovae. This simple way to estimate the properties of Type II supernovae will be essential in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) era when thousands of Type II supernovae are expected to be discovered yearly.</description>

      <title>Couplings of torsional and shear oscillations in a neutron star crust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mature neutron stars are thought to be sufficiently cold that nuclei in the outer layers freeze, solidifying a crust. Crustal elasticity allows the star to support a set of seismic modes, such as torsional oscillations. These axial-parity modes can couple to the polar sector in a number of ways, for example via rotation or a magnetic field. Even in a static, spherically-symmetric star however these modes can couple at non-linear order. In this study, such couplings in the crust are examined for the first time: we derive the axisymmetric perturbation equations for second-order axial eigenfunctions, which are sourced by axial-polar couplings at first-order, and solve the resulting equations in the time domain. Through our studies, we find that the second-order spectrum contains additional oscillation modes, not predicted by the linear analysis with either axial or polar perturbations, which can be excited to relatively large amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>

      <title>Low evidence for ringdown overtone in GW150914 when marginalizing over time and sky location uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tests of the no-hair theorem using astrophysical black holes involve the detection of at least two quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the gravitational wave emitted by a perturbed black hole. A detection of two modes -- the dominant, $(\ell, m, n) = (2,2,0)$, mode and its first overtone, the $(2,2,1)$ mode -- in the post-merger signal of the binary black hole merger GW150914 was claimed in Isi et al. [arXiv:1905.00869], with further evidence provided in Isi &amp; Farr [arXiv:2202.02941]. However, Cotesta et al. [arXiv:2201.00822] disputed this claim, finding that evidence for the overtone only appeared if the signal was analyzed before merger, when a QNM description of the signal is not valid. Due to technical challenges, both of these analyses fixed the merger time and sky location of GW150914 when estimating the evidence for the overtone. At least some of the contention can be attributed to fixing these parameters. Here, we surmount this difficulty and fully marginalize over merger time and sky-location uncertainty while doing a post-merger QNM analysis of GW150914. We find that marginalizing over all parameters yields low evidence for the presence of the overtone, with a Bayes factor of $1.10\pm 0.03$ in favor of a QNM model with the overtone versus one without. The arrival time uncertainty of GW150914 is too large to definitively claim detection of the $(2,2,1)$ mode.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes in string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory</title>

Abstract: We consider higher-order derivative gauge field corrections that arise in the fundamental context of dimensional reduction of String Theory and Lovelock-inspired gravities and obtain an exact and asymptotically flat black-hole solution, in the presence of non-trivial dilaton configurations. Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: An Analytical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions whose hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully nonlinear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. The gradient series is found to diverge for most flows, in agreement with previous findings. We identify, for the model at hand, the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly recovers all previously known instances of gradient expansion divergence. As a new prediction, we show that the gradient expansion diverges when the energy-dependent mean free path is unbounded above.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>
