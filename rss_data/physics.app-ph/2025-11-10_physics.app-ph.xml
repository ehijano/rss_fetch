      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of threading dislocations in GaN by multimodal stimulated Raman scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging gallium nitride (GaN) vertical power devices require high-quality GaN crystals with reduced crystal defects, especially threading dislocations (TDs), to harness the high critical electric field and electron mobility of the material. A strong demand for characterizing TDs has driven the development of many imaging techniques, such as multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MPPL) microscopy and spontaneous Raman microscopy. However, all these techniques lack the capability of visualizing densely existing TDs in a non-destructive and three-dimensional (3D) way or distinguishing the types of TDs. Here, we propose multimodal 3D stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and MPPL microscopy to non-destructively characterize the TDs in free-standing GaN substrates. Leveraging strong SRS signals, we achieve an imaging speed 10^2-10^3 times faster than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy. This acceleration of the imaging speed enables 3D SRS imaging of the strain fields that are induced by TDs and correlated with the edge components of the Burgers vectors. Multimodal 3D SRS and MPPL imaging reveals rich information on TD features and behavior, including propagation directions, Burgers vectors, dislocation reactions, and their relationships. Furthermore, we present a deterministic identification method for screw-type TDs, which are regarded as killer defects causing leakage current in p-n junctions, by exploiting no SRS peak shifts at screw dislocations in combination with MPPL patterns. Our multimodal imaging technique will greatly advance the understanding of dislocations toward realizing high-quality GaN crystals and high-performance GaN devices.</description>

      <title>kV-Class Lateral NiOx/GaN Super-Heterojunction Diode via Ammonia Molecular Beam Epitaxy (NH3-MBE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the demonstration of lateral p-NiOx/p-GaN/n-GaN-based super-heterojunction (SHJ) diodes using p-GaN with additional sputtered p-type nickel oxide (NiOx) layers to realize charge-balanced structures. The heterojunction diode capacitance-voltage (C-V) model is applied to extract effective the acceptor concentration from the p-NiOx. Net donor and acceptor concentration in n-GaN and p-GaN are extracted by using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structures. The fabricated p-NiOx/p-GaN/n-GaN SHJ diodes with charge-balanced region between anode and cathode exhibit a forward on-state current density of 10-30 mA/mm across an anode-to-cathode distance (LAC) from 16 {\mu}m to 80 {\mu}m. The SHJ diodes show rectifying behavior with a maximum on/off ratio of 10^9 and a low reverse leakage density. The highest breakdown voltage achieved for the SHJ diodes is ~2.8 kV with reverse leakage density of 10^-4 mA/mm at ~80% of devices catastrophic breakdown voltage. The SHJ diodes across all types of dimensions exhibit significant breakdown voltage improvements (~6X on average) with ultra-low reverse leakage current compared to corresponding reference structures without a charge-balanced extension, clearly demonstrating the superjunction effect for devices fabricated on GaN epitaxial layer with ~10^17 cm^-3 electron density.</description>

      <title>High Thermoelectric Cooling Performance of Junction Thermoelectric Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve high performance thermoelectric materials and devices, thermoelectric transistors, which integrate thermoelectric effects with transistor technology, represent a promising approach. Here p type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and n type Bi2Te2.97Se0.03 are used as the constituent materials for an NPN transistor. By applying forward bias to the emitter and reverse bias to the collector to form a common-base triode configuration, the thermoelectric effect, transistor effect, and interfacial effects within the NPN heterostructure are coupled. This NPN heterostructure induces temperature increase (heat release) at the forward biased end and temperature decrease (heat absorption) at the reverse biased end. Therefore, this device becomes a new type of thermoelectric transistor cooler. Furthermore, a DC equivalent circuit method is introduced to analyze the cooling performance of the thermoelectric transistor cooler. The results show that when the emitter voltage of the NPN thermoelectric transistor cooler is 0.01925V, the collector voltage is 0.2124V, the corresponding base region width is 0.17nm, the maximum temperature difference of 242.89K can be obtained. Even if the base region width is limited to a level of 10 nanometers, for example when the base region width is 12.78nm, the maximum temperature differenced can still reach 174.15K. The research results above indicate that the thermoelectric transistor, which synergistically combines the thermoelectric effect with transistor technology, can effectively enhance the maximum temperature difference that typical thermoelectric cooling can achieve.</description>

      <title>Stresses and fluid flow in lamina cribrosa through anisotropic poroelasticty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening for the central retinal vessels.</description>

      <title>Resonantly Pumped Tunable Tm,X:CaF2 Lasers: Effect of Buffer Ions (X = Y, La, Gd, and Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the eye-safe laser performance of Tm3+-doped calcium fluoride crystals, modified with optically inactive "buffer" cations (Y3+, Lu3+, Gd3+, and La3+), under in-band diode-pumping at 1.68 um. In the free-running regime, the 1.5 at.% Tm, 4 at.% Y:CaF2 laser operates with a high slope efficiency of 47% with respect to absorbed pump power. By employing an MgF2 birefringent plate, the emission wavelength of this laser is continuously tuned over 242 nm (1820 - 2062 nm) highlighting its potential for broadly tunable and ultrafast oscillators. The spectroscopic properties of Tm3+ ions in CaF2 crystals with and without buffer ions are also compared.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Electromagnetic Inverse Design of Scattering Structured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization. Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mikzuker/inverse_design_metasurface_generation.</description>

      <title>HTS Potential and Needs for Future Accelerator Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HTS has the potential of a game changer for many applications of superconductivity, not last in the field of particle accelerators and detectors. This paper explores the potential of HTS, with a focus on REBCO-coated conductors, in relation to the evolving demands of superconducting magnets for accelerators. HTS already have a spectacular current carrying ability at high field, demonstrated and available on relevant lengths. Recent advances in non-conventional winding techniques for solenoids, in particular non-insulated windings, have shown that it is possible to reach engineering current densities in the coil exceeding by far those of LTS . This approach seems to offer an extended field reach, as well as solutions to the challenges associated with magnet mechanics, quench management and cost. Most important, beyond the ability to reach a field range higher than what is possible with LTS, HTS offers an extended range of operating temperature, with large margin. This can be exploited to obtain higher availability and better cryogenic efficiency, a must for the future of sustainable large scale research infrastructures such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>A Certifiable Machine Learning-Based Pipeline to Predict Fatigue Life of Aircraft Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures. Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human resources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-shot near-field reconstruction of metamaterial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency surfaces of metamaterials in the microwave regime. In our approach, we excite resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe. Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive metamaterials.</description>
