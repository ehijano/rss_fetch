      <title>NGC 3259: A Signal for an Untapped Population of Slowly Accreting Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a central challenge in modern cosmology. To date only small samples of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^5M_{\odot}$) and 'lesser' supermassive black holes (LSMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^6M_{\odot}$) have been identified. Our present study of NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph complemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations demonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC 3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\times10^5M_{\odot}$, inferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the Eddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy NGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\alpha$ profile that is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR) clouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical power-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot corona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could only detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC 3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25 times lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this galaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways for the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence of a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys will detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future X-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.</description>

      <title>Impact of merger histories on the timing argument estimate of the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timing argument (TA) aims to find the total mass of the Local Group (LG) from the relative motions of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda Galaxy (M31). However, the classical TA always overestimates the LG mass, presumably because it does not account for the hierarchical scenario and other interactions such as that with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We focus on the impact of the recent major merger at M31 by using three merger models to find the peculiar motion of M31 within the simple two-body and point-mass scenario of TA. We found that the merger correction may affect the TA mass by either plus or minus 10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large uncertainties. If we consider a M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA mass by 10-15% to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as reported in the literature, the TA mass would be found consistent with the LG mass from Hubble-Lemaitre flow. Galaxies are expected to experience about 16 major mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers have similar impact on the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass would be $0.85^{+0.65}_{-0.37}$ and such a TA mass is consistent with all the LG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with the findings using LG analogues in the cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited by the hierarchical scenario, since it not possible to track the progenitors of both MW and M31 through so many mergers. We conclude that the MW-M31 dynamical system is far too complex to be modelled as a simple two-body point mass system.</description>

      <title>Inconsistent metallicity spreads in first generation stars of globular clusters from high resolution spectroscopy and HST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open issue about multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) is the possible existence of metallicity spreads in first generation (FG) stars. Recent estimates based on HST pseudo-colours map (PCM) derived unlikely large spreads in [Fe/H] from spreads in the colour col=m_{F275W}-m_{F814W}. The inferred metallicity spreads for many GCs are comparable or even larger than those observed in dwarf galaxies. This result is clearly unexpected and at odds with the birth time of stars in dwarf galaxies, spanning several billion years, as opposed to very short formation times of the stellar component in GCs (a few million years). The contradiction is corroborated by the comparison of the widths of red giant branches in both classes of objects. Moreover, the so called spreads in FG stars estimated from the PCMs are always larger than the intrinsic metallicity spreads derived from spectroscopy. We used 30 pairs of FG stars with similar parameters in 12 GCs to highlight that a constant displacement in Delta col corresponds to variable differences in [Fe/H] up to 0.2 dex, depending on the GC. Providing for the first time quantitative measurements of the extension in Delta col of the sequences of FG and SG stars, we found no relation between metallicity spreads previously derived and extension of FG stars. We found that the length of the FG region correlates with the average global metallicity of GCs, and not with the observed metallicity spreads. The extension of FG stars also correlates with the extension of SG stars, and the global mass of the GCs. Our findings seriously challenge the scenario claiming more inhomogeneous mixing among FG stars, invalidating previous speculations in the literature.</description>

      <title>The XMAGNET exascale MHD simulations of SMBH feedback in galaxy groups and clusters: Overview and preliminary cluster results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.</description>

      <title>An optical perspective on early-stage AGN with extreme radio flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) monitoring programs, the Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory detected multiple times seven powerful flaring narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies at 37 GHz. Several hypotheses have been proposed, but the understanding of this unique phenomenon is still far. To look at the case from a different point of view, we performed an emission line analysis of the optical spectra, with the aim of identifying similarities among the sources, that can be in turn possibly tied with the radio behavior. Our data were obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The results we obtained show that six out of seven sources have typical properties for the NLS1 class, and one of them is an intermediate Seyfert galaxy. We found on average black hole masses above the median value for the class (&gt; 10$^7$ M$_\odot$), and a strong Fe II emission, which could be a proxy for an intense ongoing accretion activity. Although interesting, the characteristics we found are not unusual for these kind of AGN: the optical spectra of our sources do not related with their unique radio properties. Therefore, further multi-wavelength studies will be necessary to narrow the field of hypotheses for this peculiar phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Robust machine learning model of inferring the ex-situ stellar fraction of galaxies from photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for parameters defined from photometric images to quantify the ex situ stellar mass fraction of galaxies. We created mock images using galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations TNG100, EAGLE, and TNG50 at redshift $z=0$. We define a series of parameters describing their structures. In particular, the inner and outer halo of a galaxy are defined by sectors ranging from $45-135$ degrees from the disk major axis, and with radii ranging from $3.5-10$ kpc and $10-30$ kpc, respectively, to avoid the contamination of disk and bulge. The surface brightness and colour gradients are defined by the same sectors along the minor axis and with similar radii ranges. We used the Random Forest method to create a model that predicts $f_{\rm exsitu}$ from morphological parameters. The model predicts $f_{\rm exsitu}$ well with a scatter smaller than 0.1 compared to the ground truth in all mass ranges. The models trained from TNG100 and EAGLE work similarly well and are cross-validated; they also work well in making predictions for TNG50 galaxies. The analysis using Random Forest reveals that $\nabla \rho_{\rm outer}$, $\nabla (g-r)_{\rm outer}$, $f_{\rm outerhalo}$ and $f_{\rm innerhalo}$ are the most influential parameters in predicting $f_{\rm exsitu}$, underscoring their significance in uncovering the merging history of galaxies. We further analyse how the quality of images will affect the results by using SDSS-like and HSC-like mock images for galaxies at different distances. Our results can be used to infer the ex situ stellar mass fractions for a large sample of galaxies from photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>PHIBSS: Searching for Molecular Gas Outflows in Star-Forming Galaxies at $z =$ 0.5-2.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of millimeter CO observations to search and quantify signatures of molecular gas outflows. We exploit the large sample of $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6$ galaxies observed as part of the PHIBSS1/2 surveys with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer, focusing on the 154 typical massive star-forming galaxies with CO detections (mainly CO(3-2), but including also CO(2-1) and CO(6-5)) at signal-to-noise (SNR) &gt; 1.5 and available properties (stellar mass, star formation rate, size) from ancillary data. None of the individual spectra exhibit a compelling signature of CO outflow emission even at high SNR &gt; 7. To search for fainter outflow signatures, we carry out an analysis of stacked spectra, including the full sample, as well as subsets, split in terms of stellar mass, redshift, inclination, offset in star formation rate (SFR) from the main sequence, and AGN activity. None of the physically motivated subsamples show any outflow signature. We report a tentative detection in a subset statistically designed to maximize outflow signatures. We derive upper limits on molecular gas outflow rate and mass loading factors $\eta$ based on our results and find $\eta \leq$ 2.2-35.4, depending on the subsample. Much deeper CO data and observations of alternative tracers are needed to decisively constrain the importance of cold molecular gas component of outflows relative to other gas phases.</description>

      <title>Inferring the density and membership of stellar streams with flexible models: The GD-1 stream in Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As bound stellar systems orbit within a galaxy, stars may be tidally stripped to form streams of stars that nearly follow the orbit of their progenitor system. Stellar streams provide one of the most promising avenues for constraining the global mass distribution of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter (DM). The stream stars' kinematic "track" enables inferring large-scale properties of the DM distribution, while density variations and anomalies provide information about local DM clumps (e.g., from DM subhalos). Using precise astrometric data from the Gaia Mission, which enables clean selections of Milky Way stream stars, we now know of a few streams with perturbations and density anomalies. A full accounting of the density tracks and substructures within all &gt;100 Milky Way stellar streams will therefore enable powerful new constraints on DM. However, methods for discovering and characterizing membership of streams are heterogeneous and often highly customized to individual streams. Here we present a new, flexible framework for modeling stellar stream density and membership. Our framework allows us to include off-track or non-Gaussian components to the stream density, meaning we can capture anomalous features (such as the GD-1 steam's spur). We test our model on GD-1, where we characterize previously-known features and provide the largest catalog of probable member stars to date (1689 stars). Our framework (built on JAX and numpyro) provides a path toward uniform analysis of all Milky Way streams, enabling tight constraints on the Galactic mass distribution and its dark matter.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: physically-motivated priors for dust attenuation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of dust on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is crucial for inferring their physical properties and for studying the nature of interstellar dust. We analyze dust attenuation curves for $\sim 6400$ galaxies ($M_{\star} \sim 10^9 - 10^{11.5}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z=0.07$ in the IllustrisTNG50 and TNG100 simulations. Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation curves and fit them with a parametric model that captures known extinction and attenuation laws (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions of the best-fitting parameters: UV slope ($c_1$), optical-to-NIR slope ($c_2$), FUV slope ($c_3$), 2175 Angstrom bump strength ($c_4$), and normalization ($A_{\rm V}$). Key correlations emerge between $A_{\rm V}$ and the star formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, as well as the UV slope $c_1$. The UV and FUV slopes ($c_1, c_3$) and the bump strength and visual attenuation ($c_4, A_{\rm V}$) exhibit robust internal correlations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling relations that predict a galaxy's median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation curve based solely on its $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and/or $A_{\rm V}$. These predictions agree well with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog despite minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, providing a foundation for physically motivated priors in SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto supermassive and intermediate mass black holes in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.</description>

      <title>Applying a star formation model calibrated on high-resolution interstellar medium simulations to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern high-resolution simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown that key factors in governing star formation are the competing influences of radiative dissipation, pressure support driven by stellar feedback, and the relentless pull of gravity. Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, such as IllustrisTNG or ASTRID, are however not able to resolve this physics in detail and therefore need to rely on approximate treatments. These have often taken the form of empirical subgrid models of the ISM expressed in terms of an effective equation of state (EOS) that relates the mean ISM pressure to the mean gas density. Here we seek to improve these heuristic models by directly fitting their key ingredients to results of the high-resolution TIGRESS simulations, which have shown that the dynamical equilibrium of the ISM can be understood in terms of a pressure-regulated, feedback modulated (PRFM) model for star formation. Here we explore a simple subgrid model that draws on the PRFM concept but uses only local quantities. It accurately reproduces PRFM for pure gas disks, while it predicts slightly less star formation than PRFM in the presence of an additional thin stellar disk. We compare the properties of this model with the older Springel and Hernquist and TNG prescriptions, and apply all three to isolated simulations of disk galaxies as well as to a set of high-resolution zoom-in simulations carried out with a novel 'multi-zoom' technique that we introduce in this study. The softer EOS implied by TIGRESS produces substantially thinner disk galaxies, which has important ramifications for disk stability and galaxy morphology. The total stellar mass of galaxies is however hardly modified at low redshift, reflecting the dominating influence of large-scale gaseous inflows and outflows to galaxies, which are not sensitive to the EOS itself</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the decay of perturbations in an infinite homogeneous self-gravitating model with a Maxwellian distribution function (DF) when weak collisions are present. In collisionless systems within the stable parameter range, the eigenvalue spectrum consists of a continuous set of real frequencies associated with van Kampen modes, which are singular eigenfunctions of the stellar DF. An initial perturbation in the stellar density and gravitational potential decays exponentially through a superposition of these modes, a phenomenon known as Landau damping. However, the perturbation in the stellar DF does not decay self-similarly; it becomes increasingly oscillatory in velocity space over time, indicating the absence of eigenfunctions corresponding to the Landau damping eigenfrequencies. Consequently, we refer to perturbations undergoing Landau damping as quasi-modes rather than true eigenmodes. Even rare collisions suppress the formation of steep DF gradients in velocity space. Ng &amp; Bhattacharjee (2021) demonstrated that introducing collisions eliminates van Kampen modes and transforms Landau quasi-modes into true eigenmodes forming a complete set. As the collision frequency approaches zero, their eigenfrequencies converge to those of the collisionless Landau quasi-modes. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the eigenfunction of the least-damped aperiodic mode as the collision frequency approaches zero. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenfunction in the resonance region and for the damping rate as a function of collision frequency. Additionally, we employ the standard matrix eigenvalue problem approach to numerically verify our analytical results.</description>

      <title>CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations III. The physics behind the emergence of the golden mass scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different studies have suggested the emergence of the so-called golden mass, corresponding to a virial mass of $\sim 10^{12} \, M_{\rm \odot}$ and a stellar mass of $\sim 5 \times 10^{10} \, M_{\rm \odot}$. This mass scale marks a maximum in star formation efficiency, where galaxies are minimally affected by processes like SN and AGN feedback. We use \textsc{camels} cosmological simulations, based on the IllustrisTNG subgrid, to study the origin of this mass scale and whether it persists when varying feedback from SN and AGN. We focus on the correlation between the total-to-stellar mass within the half-mass radius and stellar mass, which follows an inverted bell-shaped trend, with a minimum at the golden mass. SN feedback processes impact the emergence of the golden mass, which shifts to lower mass for high values of wind velocity and energy. We find that most AGN feedback parameters influence the emergence of the golden mass, altering the correlation slope at high mass: the black hole radiative efficiency is the most impactful, followed by the black hole feedback factor and quasar threshold. ETGs preserve the inverted bell-shaped trend, while LTGs have monotonically decreasing DM fractions with mass, with mild indication of an inversion only at low redshift, confirming results from observations. When connecting with global quantities, we see that star formation efficiency show a bell-shaped trend peaking at the golden mass, with behaviours that mirror the central quantities. In ETGs a peak at lower mass is seen, while LTGs mirror the behaviour in the central quantity, with mild indication of a maximum in the stellar fraction only at low redshift. Overall, we find that the emergence of the golden mass is driven by the SN- and AGN-feedback and appears earlier in cosmic time for stronger-feedback simulations, which faster quench star formation in the most massive galaxies.

      <title>The RR Lyrae distribution in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: RR Lyrae stars are important distance indicators. They are usually present in globular clusters where they were first discovered. The study of their properties and distribution in our Galaxy and external galaxies constitutes a modern field of astrophysical research. The aim of this paper is checking the possibility that the observed distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge derives from orbitally decayed globular clusters (GCs).
  Methods: To reach the aim of the paper I made use of the comparison of observational data of RR Lyrae in the Galactic bulge with the distribution of GCs in the Milky Way (MW) as coming from theoretical models under a set of assumptions.
  Results: I obtain the expected numbers and distributions of RR Lyrae in the Galactic bulge as coming from an initial population of globular clusters at varying some characteristic parameters of the GC population and compare to observational data.
  Conclusion: The abundance of RR Lyrae distribution in the Galactic bulge and their radial distribution is likely still too uncertain to provide a straight comparison with theoretical models. Despite this, it can be stated that a significant fraction of the `foreground' RR Lyrae present in the MW originate from orbitally evolved and dissolved GCs.</description>

      <title>SEW: A full-spectrum linear fitting with stellar population synthesis method Based on "Equivalent Widths spectrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full-spectrum linear fitting method, SEW, for stellar population synthesis based on equivalent widths (EWs) to extract galaxy properties from observed spectra. This approach eliminates the need for prior assumptions about dust attenuation curves, which are instead derived as outputs of the fitting process. By leveraging the invariance of EWs and employing the Discrete Penalised Least Squares (DPLS) method to extract EWs, we address the nonlinear aspects of the fitting process by linearising the matrix equations. This enables accurate recovery of key parameters, stellar age, metallicity and dust attenuation, even under systematic calibration biases and varying attenuation conditions. Rigorous testing with mock spectra across signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 5-30) and calibration biases demonstrates the robustness of method. The derived attenuation curves align closely with input models, and stellar population parameters are recovered with minimal bias. To facilitate adoption, we implement this method as a Python extension package for \texttt{pPXF} (\texttt{pPXF-SEW}). Our work addresses critical degeneracies in traditional spectral fitting and enhances the reliability of extragalactic studies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a 36 Billion Solar Mass Black Hole at the Centre of the Cosmic Horseshoe Gravitational Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$), via the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies ($z &lt; 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a $5\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with $\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe $\sim$$1.5\sigma$ above the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation and its evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical accretion flow from the G351 infrared dark filament to its central cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of 0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via intermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. VIII. The Spatially Resolved Star Formation History of WLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0$\lesssim$R$_{SMA}$$\lesssim$4 kpc ($\lesssim$3R$_{hl}$). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using $\tau_{90}$ and $\tau_{50}$, the lookback times to form 90\% and 50\% of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with ($\delta$$\tau_{90}$, $\delta$$\tau_{50}$)/$\delta$R$_{SMA}=$(0.82$^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$, 1.60$^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6$\lesssim$R$_{SMA}$$\lesssim$3.2 kpc ($\sim$0.5$-$2.5R$_{hl}$) and lookback times up to $\sim$8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Lowest-mass X-ray selected AGNs in the Bo\"otes Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass galaxies in the Bo\"otes field with the aim of improving constraints on the occupation fraction of low-mass black holes (BHs). Galaxies with low stellar masses ($M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain BHs that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early Universe. Using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous low-mass galaxies and assess whether they host AGNs. We find one of these sources to be variable in the X-ray and compute its X-ray light curve and spectrum. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established AGN luminosity relationships in the literature. We then fit various star-forming, dust emission, and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The star formation rates estimated from the SED fits are unable to explain the observed X-ray luminosities of the candidates, providing more support for the presence of AGNs. By analysing the deviation from linear relationships between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosities, we find these systems to be obscured (with $\log N_{\rm H}[{\rm {cm^{-2}}}] \sim 22.7, &gt; 25.0$, and $24.4$, respectively). We employ the scaling relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion to estimate the BH masses as $\sim 10^5 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and accreting at Eddington ratios $10^{-2} &lt; \lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Segregation in Nuclear Stellar Clusters: Rates and Mass Distributions of TDEs, QPEs, Plunges, and EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass black holes, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass black holes, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 10$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass black holes, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier black holes, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier black holes to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>Towards Robustness Across Cosmological Simulation Models TNG, SIMBA, ASTRID, and EAGLE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-scale cosmological simulations has opened new avenues for cosmological and astrophysical research. However, the increasing diversity among cosmological simulation models presents a challenge to the robustness. In this work, we develop the Model-Insensitive ESTimator (MIEST), a machine that can robustly estimate the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, from neural hydrogen maps of simulation models in the CAMELS project$-$TNG, SIMBA, ASTRID, and EAGLE. An estimator is considered robust if it possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including those used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple simulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the models while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to develop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters across a range of simulation models, without being biased towards any particular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space$-$a set of summary statistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending of latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of model-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking robustness, the average performance of MIEST on the unseen simulations during the training phase has been improved by $\sim17$% for $\Omega_m$ and $\sim 38$% for $\sigma_8$. By using a machine learning approach that can extract robust, yet physical features, we hope to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in a (subgrid) model-insensitive manner, and ultimately, gain insight into the underlying physical processes responsible for robustness.

      <title>Learning the Universe: $3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ Tests of a Field Level $N$-body Simulation Emulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply and test a field-level emulator for non-linear cosmic structure formation in a volume matching next-generation surveys. Inferring the cosmological parameters and initial conditions from which the particular galaxy distribution of our Universe was seeded can be achieved by comparing simulated data to observational data. Previous work has focused on building accelerated forward models that efficiently mimic these simulations. One of these accelerated forward models uses machine learning to apply a non-linear correction to the linear $z=0$ Zeldovich approximation (ZA) fields, closely matching the cosmological statistics in the $N$-body simulation. This emulator was trained and tested at $(h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, although cosmological inference requires significantly larger volumes. We test this emulator at $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ by comparing emulator outputs to $N$-body simulations for eight unique cosmologies. We consider several summary statistics, applied to both the raw particle fields and the dark matter (DM) haloes. We find that the power spectrum, bispectrum and wavelet statistics of the raw particle fields agree with the $N$-body simulations within ${\sim} 5 \%$ at most scales. For the haloes, we find a similar agreement between the emulator and the $N$-body for power spectrum and bispectrum, though a comparison of the stacked profiles of haloes shows that the emulator has slight errors in the positions of particles in the highly non-linear interior of the halo. At these large $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, the emulator can create $z=0$ particle fields in a thousandth of the time required for $N$-body simulations and will be a useful tool for large-scale cosmological inference. This is a Learning the Universe publication.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: Learning to Optimize Cosmic Initial Conditions with Non-Differentiable Structure Formation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.</description>

      <title>On the Impacts of Halo Model Implementations in Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlation Analyses</title>

Abstract: Statistical studies of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations offer a promising method of studying the gas properties of galaxies and the astrophysics that govern their evolution. Forward modeling profiles from theory and simulations allows them to be refined directly off of data, but there are currently significant differences between the thermal SZ (tSZ) observations of the CGM and the predicted tSZ signal. While these discrepancies could be inherent, they could also be the result of decisions in the forward modeling used to build statistical measures off of theory. In order to see effects of this, we compare an analysis utilizing halo occupancy distributions (HODs) implemented in halo models to simulate the galaxy distribution against a previous studies which weighted their results off of the CMASS galaxy sample, which contains nearly one million galaxies, mainly centrals of group sized halos, selected for relatively uniform stellar mass across redshifts between $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7$. We review some of the implementation differences that can account for changes, such as miscentering, one-halo/two-halo cutoff radii, and mass ranges, all of which will need to be given the proper attention in future high-signal-to-noise studies. We find that our more thorough model predicts a signal $\sim 25\%$ stronger than the one from previous studies on the exact same sample, resulting in a $33\%$ improved fit for non-dust-contaminated angular scales. Additionally, we find that modifications that change the satellite fraction even by just a few percents, such as editing the halo mass range and certain HOD parameters, result in strong changes in the final signal. Although significant, this discrepancy from the modeling choices is not large enough to completely account for the existing disagreements between simulations and measurements.</description>

      <title>Using detailed single star and binary evolution models to probe the large observed luminosity spread of red supergiants in young open star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) represent a late evolutionary stage of massive stars. Recent observations reveal that the observed luminosity range of RSGs in young open clusters is wider than expected from single star evolution models. Binary evolution effects have been suggested as a possible explanation. Here, we analyse 3670 detailed binary-evolution models, as well as corresponding single-star models, to probe the contribution of binary mass transfer and binary mergers on the luminosity distribution of RSGs in star clusters with ages up to 100 Myr. We confirm that the expected luminosity range of RSGs in a coeval population can span a factor of ten, as a consequence of mergers between two main-sequence stars, which reproduces the observed red supergiant luminosity ranges in rich clusters well. While the luminosity increase as consequence of mass transfer is more limited, it may help to increase the number of overluminous RSGs. However, our results also demonstrate that binary effects alone are insufficient to account for the number of RSGs found with luminosities of up to three times those predicted by current single-star models. We discuss observational accuracy, rotational mixing, age spread, and intrinsic RSG variability as possible explanations. Further observations of RSGs in young open clusters, in particular studies of their intrinsic brightness variability, appear crucial for disentangling these effects.</description>

      <title>Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: Corona Australis 151, the densest pre-stellar core or the youngest protostar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and represent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems. Due to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the number of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected a sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the Herschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that stands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use molecular lines that trace dense gas (n&gt;=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the exceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and to understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4 transitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We use the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the core's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five lines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very high densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We infer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect several other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also detect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of high-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and the fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing frequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall motions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or as the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO). *SHORTENED*</description>

      <title>Testing galaxy formation models with the stellar mass-halo mass relations for star-forming and quiescent galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tight relationship between the stellar mass and halo mass of galaxies is one of the most fundamental scaling relations in galaxy formation and evolution. It has become a critical constraint for galaxy formation models. Over the past decade, growing evidence has convincingly shown that the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for star-forming and quiescent central galaxies differ significantly: at a given stellar mass, the average host halo mass of quiescent centrals is more massive than that of the star-forming centrals. Despite the importance of this feature, its scientific implications have not yet been fully recognized or thoroughly explored in the field. In this work, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully reproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not. Consequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient at converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given halo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both populations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem from distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We show that the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy formation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly histories, and in which the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase significantly since cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching strongly prefers to happen in early-formed halos are not very favored. Additionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG, but absent in Illustris and EAGLE.</description>

      <title>Application of the FRADO model of BLR formation to the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 and the first step toward determining the Hubble constant</title>

Abstract: The dynamical and geometric structures of the Broad Line Region (BLR), along with the origins of continuum time delays in active galaxies, remain topics of ongoing debate. In this study, we aim to reproduce the broadband spectrum, the H$\beta$ line delay, and the continuum time delays available for the source NGC 5548. We employ the standard accretion disk model with the option of an inner hot flow, alongside the lamp-post model to account for disk irradiation and a BLR structure model based on radiation pressure acting on dust. The model is parameterized by the black hole mass (fixed), accretion rate, viewing angle, lamp-post height, cloud density, and cloud covering factor. The resulting continuum delays are calculated as a combination of disk reprocessing and the reprocessing of a fraction of radiation by the BLR. Our model reasonably reproduces the observed broad-band continuum, the H$\beta$ delay, and the continuum inter-band time delays measured during the observational campaign. When the accretion rate is not fixed based on the known distance to the source, we can directly estimate the distance from our model. The resulting value of $H_0$ = $79.8^{+5.5}_{-16.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ represents a noteworthy improvement compared to the findings of Cackett et al. (2007). This pilot study demonstrates that, with sufficient data coverage, it is possible to disentangle the time delays originating from the accretion disk and the BLR. This paves the way for effectively using inter-band continuum time delays in determining the Hubble constant. Additionally, the findings support the adopted model for the formation of the H$\beta$ line.</description>

      <title>Tripling the Census of Dwarf AGN Candidates Using DESI Early Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGN in 75,928/296,261 ($\approx$25.6%) high-mass ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) &gt;$ 9.5) and 2,444/114,496 ($\approx$2.1%) dwarf ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \leq$ 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad H$\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN and doubles the number of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{BH} \le 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $&lt; \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt;$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $&lt; \rm z &lt;$ 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the $M_{BH} - M_{\star}$ scaling relation down to $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx$ 8.5 and $\log (M_{BH}/\rm M_{\odot}) \approx$ 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas and dust properties in $z&gt;7$ quasar hosts</title>

Abstract: Observational campaigns hunting the elusive reservoirs of cold gas in the host galaxies of quasars at the epoch of reionization (EoR) are crucial for studying the formation and evolution of the first massive systems at early epochs.
  We present new Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations tracing CO(6--5) and CO(7--6) emission lines as well as the underlying continuum in five of the eight quasars at redshift $z&gt;7$ known to date, thus completing the survey of the cold molecular gas reservoir in the host galaxies of the first quasars.
  Combining NOEMA observations with archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data, we modeled the far-infrared spectral energy distribution with a modified blackbody function to measure dust properties and star formation rates.
  We used CO and [CII] lines to derive molecular gas masses, which we compared with results from semi-analytic models and observations of galaxies at different epochs.
  No statistically significant detection of CO emission lines was reported for the five quasars in this sample, resulting in a relatively low amount of cold molecular gas in the host when compared with galaxies at later epochs.
  Nonetheless, gas-to-dust ratios are consistent with the local value, suggesting that the scaling relation between dust and cold gas holds up to $z&gt;7$.
  Quasars at the EoR show star formation efficiencies that are among the highest observed so far and comparable with those observed in luminous quasars at Cosmic Noon and those predicted for the brightest ($L_{bol}&gt;3\times10^{46}$ erg s$^-1$) quasar objects drawn from the semi-analytic model GAEA.
  Quasar host galaxies at the EoR are undergoing an intense phase of star formation, which suggests a strong coupling between the luminous phase of the quasar and the rapid growth of the host.</description>

      <title>Revealing the hidden cosmic feast: A z=4.3 galaxy group hosting two optically dark, efficiently star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the confirmation of a compact galaxy group candidate, CGG-z4, at $z=4.3$ in the COSMOS field. This structure was identified by two spectroscopically confirmed $z=4.3$ $K_s$-dropout galaxies with ALMA $870\rm\, \mu m$ and 3 mm continuum detections, surrounded by an overdensity of NIR-detected galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts of $4.0&lt;z&lt;4.6$. The two ALMA sources, CGG-z4.a and CGG-z4.b, are detected with both CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines. [CI](1-0) is detected on CGG-z4.a, and H$_{2}$O($1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}$) absorption is detected on CGG-z4.b. We model an integrated spectral energy distribution by combining the FIR-to-radio photometry of this group and estimate a total star formation rate of $\rm\sim2000\, M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, making it one of the most star-forming groups known at $z&gt;4$. Their high CO(5-4)/CO(4-3) ratios indicate that the inter-stellar mediums (ISMs) are close to thermalization, suggesting either high gas temperatures, densities, and/or pressure, while the low [CI](1-0)/CO(4-3) line ratios indicate high star formation efficiencies. With [CI]-derived gas masses we found the two galaxies have extremely short gas depletion times of $99$ Myr and $&lt;63$ Myr respectively, suggesting the onset of quenching. With an estimated halo mass of $\rm log (M_{\rm halo}[M_{\odot}])\sim12.8$, we suggest that this structure is likely in the process of forming a massive galaxy cluster.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m\lesssim10^{-20}$ eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m&lt;1.5\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\sigma$ confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors $m&lt;5\times10^{-22}$ eV ($2\sigma$). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.</description>

      <title>Galactic Compton Wavelengths in $f(R)$ Screening Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>
