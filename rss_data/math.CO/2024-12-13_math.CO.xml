      <title>$s$-almost $t$-intersecting families for vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space. Write $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(H;t)=\{F\in \mathcal{F}\colon \dim(F\cap H)\leq t \}$ for a subspace $H$. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if $|\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(F;t)|\leq s$ for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$. In this note, we prove that $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families with maximum size are $t$-intersecting.</description>

      <title>Cover numbers by certain graph families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the cover number of a graph $G$ by a graph class $\mathcal P$ as the minimum number of graphs of class $\mathcal P$ required to cover the edge set of $G$. Taking inspiration from a paper by Harary, Hsu and Miller, we find an exact formula for the cover number by the graph classes $\{ G \mid \chi(G) \leq f(\omega(G))\}$ for an arbitrary non-decreasing function $f$.
  After this, we establish a chain of inequalities with five cover numbers, the one by the class $\{ G \mid \chi(G) = \omega(G)\}$, by the class of perfect graphs, generalized split graphs, co-unipolar graphs and finally by bipartite graphs. We prove that at each inequality, the difference between the two sides can grow arbitrarily large. We also prove that the cover number by unipolar graphs cannot be expressed in terms of the chromatic or the clique number.</description>

      <title>Double Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which polygons admit two (or more) distinct lattice tilings of the plane? We call such polygons double tiles. It is well-known that a lattice tiling is always combinatorially isomorphic either to a grid of squares or to a grid of regular hexagons. We focus on the special case of the double tile problem where both tilings are in the square class. For this special case, we give an explicit description of all double tiles. We establish the result for polyominoes first; then, with little additional effort, we extend the proof to general polygons. Central to the description is a certain finite set of transformations which we apply iteratively to a base shape in order to obtain one family of "fractal-like" polyominoes. The double tiles are then given by these polyominoes together with particular "deformations" of them.</description>

      <title>Classifying Z-related sets of order 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In atonal music theory, given a microtonal scale consisting of $n$ pitches, two chords are said to be Z-related if they have the same multiset of intervals between pitches. (This is mathematically equivalent to the study of homometric subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ in X-ray crystallography.) It is a difficult open problem to classify Z-related chords, even upon restriction to a given number of pitches (i.e., order); in fact, a classification is known only for the smallest possible order, namely 4. In these notes, we introduce visualizations we call ``orbital diagrams,'' in order to represent infinite two-parameter families of Z-related chords. We then write down certain relations within and among certain families of order 5. The results sketched herein will be expanded upon in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>On higher-dimensional symmetric designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two kinds of generalizations of symmetric block designs to higher dimensions, the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-cubes and $\mathcal{P}$-cubes. For small parameters all examples up to equivalence are determined by computer calculations. Known properties of automorphisms of symmetric designs are extended to autotopies of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes, while counterexamples are found for $\mathcal{C}$-cubes. An algorithm for the classification of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes with prescribed autotopy groups is developed and used to construct more examples. A linear bound on the dimension of difference sets for $\mathcal{P}$-cubes is proved and shown to be tight in elementary abelian groups. The construction is generalized to arbitrary groups by introducing regular sets of (anti)automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Minimal pentagulations of $n$-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar graph $G$ is called a pentagulation of an $n$-gon ($n\geq$ is an integer) if all faces of $G$ are pentagons, except one, which is an $n$-gon. A $3$-connected pentagulation $G$ of an $n$-gon is called minimal if it has the smallest number of pentagons among all such $3$-connected pentagulations. It is known that minimal pentagulations of the $3$-gon and $4$-gon contain 15 and 14 pentagons, respectively. We determined all minimal pentagulations of $n$-gons for all $n$ such that $3\leq n\leq 12$ using computer calculations. The calculations employed the plantri package, which generates all planar triangulations for a given number of vertices. We also present several open questions on this topic.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on descents, inversions and the weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the notion of partition of elements in an arbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$: a partition of an element $w$ is a subset $\mathcal P\subseteq W$ such that the left inversion set of $w$ is the disjoint union of the left inversion set of the elements in $\mathcal P$. Partitions of elements of $W$ arises in the study of the Belkale-Kumar product on the cohomology $H^*(X,\mathbb Z)$, where $X$ is the complete flag variety of any complex semi-simple algebraic group. Partitions of elements in the symmetric group $\mathcal S_n$ are also related to the {\em Babington-Smith model} in algebraic statistics or to the simplicial faces of the Littlewood-Richardson cone.
  We state the conjecture that the number of right descents of $w$ is the sum of the number of right descents of the elements of $\mathcal P$ and prove that this conjecture holds in the cases of symmetric groups (type $A$) and hyperoctahedral groups (type $B$).</description>

      <title>Random Tur\'an Problems for $K_{s,t}$ Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_{s,t}^{(r)}$ denote the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from the graph $K_{s,t}$ by inserting $r-2$ new vertices inside each edge of $K_{s,t}$. We prove essentially tight bounds on the size of a largest $K_{s,t}^{(r)}$-subgraph of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$ whenever $r\ge 2s/3+2$, giving the first random Tur\'an results for expansions that go beyond a natural "tight-tree barrier." In addition to this, our methods yield optimal supersaturation results for $K_{s,t}^{(3)}$ for sufficiently dense host hypergraphs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (vertex) colouring of graph is \emph{acyclic} if it contains no bicoloured cycle. In 1979, Borodin proved that planar graphs are acyclically 5-colourable. In 2010, Kawarabayashi and Mohar proved that locally planar graphs are acyclically 7-colourable. In 2002, Borodin, Fon-Der-Flaass, Kostochka, Raspaud, and Sopena proved that planar graphs are acyclically 7-list-colourable. We prove that locally planar graphs are acyclically 9-list-colourable\textemdash no bound for acyclic list colouring locally planar graphs for any fixed number of colours was previously known.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Moving Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Mellin integrals of products of hyperplanes, raised to an individual power each. We refer to the resulting functions as combinatorial correlators. We investigate their behavior when moving the hyperplanes individually. To encode these functions as holonomic functions in the constant terms of the hyperplanes, we aim to construct a holonomic annihilating $D$-ideal purely in terms of the hyperplane arrangement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of the Hermitian unital of order 3 (obtained from the non-degenerate hermitian form in three variables over the field of order 9) inside the octonion algebra over the field of order 2. This construction is invariant under the automorphism group of that algebra, and explains the known isomorphism from the finite group of exceptional Lie type onto the group of semi-similitudes of the hermitian form.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of the curl of a vector field X on a finite simple graph as the projection of X onto the orthogonal complement of circulation-free vector fields, where a vector field is circulation-free provided its line integral around every simple circuit vanishes. We justify the definition by observing that X and curl X have the same circulation and curl of the gradient and divergence of the curl vanish. This shows the gradient, curl, and divergence operators form an exact sequence, in analogy with the classical case of vector fields on Euclidean domains and yields the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field on a graph as the sum of a gradient, a curl, and a harmonic field. Along the way, we also prove analogues of the divergence theorem, Green's identities, and Helmholtz's theorem. A consequence of our definition is that the curl is a non-local operator, in sharp contrast to the classical case and existing notions of curl on a graph.</description>

Abstract: Associated to any unit interval graph, Syu Kato introduced a variety which gives (via the geometric Satake correspondence) a graded $GL_m$ representation whose character is the chromatic quasisymmetric polynomial of the graph. In this short note, we reprove Kato's result by analyzing the fixed points of his varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending a previous result of the first two authors, we prove a local limit theorem for the joint distribution of subgraph counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. This limit can be described as a nonlinear transformation of a multivariate normal distribution, where the components of the multivariate normal correspond to the graph factors of Janson. As an application, we show a number of results concerning the existence and enumeration of proportional graphs and related concepts, answering various questions of Janson and collaborators in the affirmative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every smooth Jordan curve $\gamma \subset \mathbb{C}$ and for every set $Q \subset \mathbb{C}$ of six concyclic points, there exists a non-constant quadratic polynomial $p \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ such that $p(Q) \subset \gamma$. The proof relies on a theorem of Fukaya and Irie. We also prove that if $Q$ is the union of the vertex sets of two concyclic regular $n$-gons, there exists a non-constant polynomial $p \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ of degree at most $n-1$ such that $p(Q) \subset \gamma$. The proof is based on a computation in Floer homology. These results support a conjecture about which point sets $Q \subset \mathbb{C}$ admit a polynomial inscription of a given degree into every smooth Jordan curve $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Spectral Edge of Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $d\geq 3$ and $k\geq 2$, the set of limit points of the first $k$ eigenvalues of sequences of $d$-regular graphs is
  \[
  \{(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_k): d=\mu_1\geq \dots\geq \mu_{k}\geq2\sqrt{d-1}\}.
  \] The result for $k=2$ was obtained by Alon and Wei, and our result confirms a conjecture of theirs. Our proof uses an infinite random graph sampled from a distribution that generalizes the random regular graph distribution. To control the spectral behavior of this infinite object, we show that Huang and Yau's proof of Friedman's theorem bounding the second eigenvalue of a random regular graph generalizes to this model. We also bound the trace of the non-backtracking operator, as was done in Bordenave's separate proof of Friedman's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for an infinite collection of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to be pierceable by finitely many axis-parallel $k$-flats, where $0 \leq k &lt; d$. We also consider colorful generalizations of the above result and establish their feasibility. The problem considered in this paper is an infinite variant of the Hadwiger-Debrunner $(p, q)$-problem.</description>

      <title>Larger Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01057</link>

Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set ${\cal A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors of ${\cal A}$ include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists some $\delta = \delta(p)&gt;0$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k/\log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. The size of the set is optimal up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. We further prove two extensions of this result. In the first, we provide a large set ${\cal A}$ of non-self-orthogonal vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ such that for every two subsets of ${\cal A}$ of size $k+1$ each, some vector of one of the subsets is orthogonal to some vector of the other. In the second extension, every $k+1$ vectors of the produced set ${\cal A}$ include $\ell+1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors for an arbitrary fixed integer $1 \leq \ell \leq k$. The proofs involve probabilistic and spectral arguments and the hypergraph container method.</description>

      <title>The number of edges in graphs with bounded clique number and circumference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\cal H$ be a family of graphs. The Tur\'an number ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ is the maximum possible number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain any member of $\cal H$ as a subgraph. As a common generalization of Tur\'an's theorem and Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem on the Tur\'an number of matchings, Alon and Frankl determined ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for ${\cal H}=\{K_r,M_k\}$, where $M_k$ is a matching of size $k$. Replacing $M_k$ by $P_k$, Katona and Xiao obtained the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r,P_k\}$ for $r \leq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ and sufficiently large $n$. In addition, they proposed a conjecture for the case of $r \geq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+1$ and sufficiently large $n$. Motivated by the fact that the result for ${\rm ex}(n,P_k)$ can be deduced from the one for ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal C}_{\geq k})$, we investigate the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r, {\cal C}_{\geq k}\}$ in this paper. In other words, we aim to determine the maximum number of edges in graphs with clique number at most $r-1$ and circumference at most $k-1$. For ${\cal H}=\{K_r, {\cal C}_{\geq k}\}$, we are able to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for $r \geq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+2$ and all $n$. As an application of this result, we confirm Katona and Xiao's conjecture in a stronger form. For $r \leq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+1$, we manage to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an numbers of cycles plus a general graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family of graphs $\cal F$, a graph $G$ is $\cal F$-free if it does not contain a member of $\cal F$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number $\textrm{ex}(n,{\cal F})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph which is $\cal F$-free. Let ${\cal C}_{\geq k}$ be the set of cycles with length at least $k$. In this paper, we investigate the Tur\'an number of $\{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, F\}$ for a general graph $F$. To be precise, we determine $\textrm{ex}(n, \{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, F\})$ apart from a constant additive term, where $F$ either is a 2-connected nonbipartite graph or is a 2-connected bipartite graph under some conditions. This is an extension of a previous result on the Tur\'an number of $\{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, K_r\}$ by the first author, Ning, and the third author.</description>

      <title>Extreme singular values of inhomogeneous sparse random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to bounding the largest and smallest singular values of an inhomogeneous random rectangular matrix, based on the non-backtracking operator and the Ihara-Bass formula for general random Hermitian matrices with a bipartite block structure. We obtain probabilistic upper (respectively, lower) bounds for the largest (respectively, smallest) singular values of a large rectangular random matrix $X$. These bounds are given in terms of the maximal and minimal $\ell_2$-norms of the rows and columns of the variance profile of $X$. The proofs involve finding probabilistic upper bounds on the spectral radius of an associated non-backtracking matrix $B$. The two-sided bounds can be applied to the centered adjacency matrix of sparse inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi bipartite graphs for a wide range of sparsity, down to criticality. In particular, for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi bipartite graphs $G(n,m,p)$ with $p=\omega(\log n)/n$, and $m/n\to y \in (0,1)$, our sharp bounds imply that there are no outliers outside the support of the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law almost surely. This result extends the Bai-Yin theorem to sparse rectangular random matrices.</description>

      <title>On arrangements of smooth plane quartics and their bitangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we revisit the geometry of smooth plane quartics and their bitangents from several perspectives. First, we study in detail the weak combinatorics of arrangements of bitangents associated with highly symmetric quartic curves. We consider quartic curves from the point of view of the order of their automorphism groups, in order to establish a lower bound on the number of quadruple intersection points for arrangements of bitangents associated with smooth plane quartics, which are smooth members of Ciani's pencil. We then construct new examples of $3$-syzygy reduced plane curves using smooth plane quartics and their bitangents.</description>

      <title>Minimal semisimple Hessenberg schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a collection of Hessenberg varieties in the type A flag variety associated to a nonzero semisimple matrix whose conjugacy class has minimal dimension. We prove each such minimal semisimple Hessenberg variety is a union Richardson varieties and compute this set of Richardson varieties explicitly. Our methods leverage the notion of matrix Hessenberg schemes to answer questions about the geometry of minimal semisimple Hessenberg varieties using commutative algebra and known results on Schubert determinantal ideals. In particular, we show that all type A minimal semisimple matrix Hessenberg schemes are reduced.</description>
