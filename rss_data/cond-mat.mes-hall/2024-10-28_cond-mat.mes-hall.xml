      <title>Using Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy to Separately Quantify the Effect of Strain on Nanosheet and Junction Resistance in Printed Nanosheet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many printed electronic applications require strain-independent electrical properties to ensure deformation-independent performance. Thus, developing printed, flexible devices using 2D and other nanomaterials will require an understanding of the effect of strain on the electrical properties of nano-networks. Here we introduce novel AC electrical techniques to fully characterise the effect of strain on the resistance of high mobility printed networks, fabricated from of electrochemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets. These devices were initially characterised using DC piezoresistance measurements and showed good cyclability and a linear strain response, consistent with a low gauge factor of G~3. However, AC impedance spectroscopy measurements, performed as a function of strain, allowed the measurement of the effects of strain on both the nanosheets and the inter-nanosheet junctions separately. The junction resistance was found to increase linearly with strain, while the nanosheet resistance remained constant. This response is consistent with strain-induced sliding of the highly-aligned nanosheets past one another, without any strain being transferred to the sheets themselves. Our approach allows us to individually estimate the contributions of dimensional factors (G~1.4) and intrinsic factors (G~1.9) to the total gauge factor. This novel technique may provide insight into other piezoresistive systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband THz Conductivity of Gated Graphene In- and Out-of-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to expose the high-frequency transport properties of Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene. By controlling the carrier concentration via tunable electrical gating, both equilibrium and transient optical conductivities are obtained for a range of Fermi levels. The frequency-dependent equilibrium response is determined through a combination of time-domain THz and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for energies up to the near-infrared, which also provides a measure of the gate-voltage dependent Fermi level. Transient changes in the real and imaginary parts of the graphene conductivity are electro-optically resolved for frequencies up to 15 THz after near-infrared femtosecond excitation, both at the charge-neutral point and for higher electrostatic-doping levels. Modeling of the THz response provides insight into changes of the carrier spectral weights and scattering rates, and reveals an additional broad-frequency ($\approx$ 8 THz) component to the photo-induced response, which we attribute to the zero-momentum mode of quantum-critical transport observed here in large-area CVD graphene.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Kohn anomaly in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has attracted great interest in the last decade due to the novel properties it exhibited. It was revealed that e-phonon interaction plays an important role in a variety of phenomena in this system, such as superconductivity and exotic phases. However, due to its complexity, the e-phonon interaction in TBG is not well studied yet. In this work, we study the electron interaction with the acoustic phonon mode in twisted bilayer graphene and one of its consequences, i.e., the Kohn anomaly. The Kohn anomaly in ordinary metals usually happens at phonon momentum q = 2kF as a dramatic modification of the phonon frequency when the phonon wave vector nests the electron Fermi surface. However, novel Kohn anomaly can happen in topological semimetals, such as graphene and Weyl semimetals. In this work, we show that the novel dynamic Kohn anomaly can also take place in twisted bilayer graphene due to the nesting of two different Moire Dirac points by the phonon wave vector. Moreover, by tuning the twist angle, the dynamic Kohn anomaly in TBG shows different features. Particularly, at magic angle when the electron bandwidth is almost flat, the dynamic Kohn anomalies of acoustic phonons disappear. We also studied the effects of finite temperature and doping on the dynamic Kohn anomaly in TBG and discussed the experimental methods to observe the Kohn anomaly in such system.</description>

      <title>Multivalued dispersion equation for plasmon-surface optical phonon coupling in graphene/polar substrate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion equations are a common paradigm of collective excitation physics. However, in some systems, dispersion equations contain multivalued functions and their solutions are ambiguous. As an example, we consider graphene on a polar substrate where Dirac plasmons are coupled with surface optical phonons. The dispersion equation for this system contains square-root singularity. Using the initial value problem resolves this uncertainty and gives a unique solution. Particularly, we found that lower plasmon-phonon mode, which in terms of dispersion can have a good quality factor, is almost absent in excitation spectra. The physical reason and experimental evidence of the mode collapse are discussed.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corbino effect in nonreciprocal many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a magnetic field is applied in the perpendicular direction to a metallic disk under the action of a radial bias voltage, a tangential electric current superimposes to the radial current due to the presence of the Lorentz force which acts on electrons. Here we introduce a thermal analog of this Corbino effect in many-body systems made of nonreciprocal bodies which interact by exchanging photons in near-field regime. In systems out of thermal equilibrium with a radial temperature gradient, we demonstrate that the Poynting field in the Corbino geometry is bent in presence of an external magnetic field, giving rise to a tangential heat flux. This thermomagnetic effect could find applications in the field of thermal management and energy conversion at nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>Parametric longitudinal coupling of a semiconductor charge qubit and a RF resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a full experimental characterization of the parametric longitudinal coupling between a CMOS charge qubit and an off-chip RF resonator. Following Corrigan et al, Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 064005 (2023), we activate parametric longitudinal coupling by driving the charge qubit at the resonator frequency. Managing the crosstalk between the drive applied to the qubit and the resonator allows for the systematic study of the dependence of the longitudinal and dispersive charge-photon couplings on the qubit-resonator detuning and the applied drive. Our experimental estimations of the charge-photon couplings are perfectly reproduced by theoretical simple formulas, without relying on any fitting parameter. We go further by showing a parametric displacement of the resonator's steady state, conditional on the qubit state, and the insensitivity of the longitudinal coupling constant on the photon population of the resonator. Our results open to the exploration of the photon-mediated longitudinal readout and coupling of multiple and distant spins, with long coherent times, in hybrid CMOS cQED architectures.</description>

      <title>Rectification from band gap oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a chain of divalent atoms with two electronic orbitals per atom, whose length is periodically oscillating with time in response to an external oscillating pressure source. We introduce both inter-orbital and intra-orbital hopping between neighboring atoms which as a consequence of the oscillating lattice separation, are also periodically oscillating in time. Within the tight binding approximation and in the limit of very small inter-orbital hopping, we get two bands separated by an indirect band gap which itself oscillates due to the oscillating chain length. Under suitable choice of hopping parameters (about which it oscillates) and orbital energies, we show that there can be a periodic metal-insulator transition in the half-filled system. If the frequency of the metal-insulator transition resonates with an externally applied alternating electric field, it can give rise to the phenomena of half-wave rectification wherein in one half of the cycle the system is metallic and conducting, where as in the other half of the cycle it is insulating and non-conducting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic radiative heat transfer in the transition from far field to near field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high precision measurements of the radiative heat transfer of a glass microsphere immersed in a thermal bath in vacuum facing three different planar substrates (SiO2, SiC and Au), which exhibit very different optical behaviors in the infrared region. Using a thermoresistive probe on a cantilever, we show the non-monotonic behavior of the radiative flux between the microsphere and its environment when the microsphere is brought closer to the substrate in the far-field to near-field transition regime. We demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is related to the singularities of dressed emission mechanisms in this three-body system sphere-substrate-bath with respect to the separation distance.</description>

      <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. Here, we show that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital-momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and pave the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Ionic-Bonded Structures in NiSe Nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional van der Waals (1D vdW) materials, characterized by atomic chains bonded ionically or covalently in one direction and held together by van der Waals interactions in the perpendicular directions, have recently gained intensive attention due to their exceptional functions. In this work, we report the discovery of 1D ionic-bonded structures in NiSe nanowires. Utilizing aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we identified four distinct structural phases composed of two fundamental 1D building blocks: a triangle-shaped unit and a parallelogram-shaped unit. These phases can transform into one another through topotactic combinations of the structural units. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these structural units are bound by ionic bonds, unlike the van der Waals forces typically found in 1D vdW materials. The diverse arrangements of these building blocks may give rise to unique electronic structures and magnetic properties, paving the way for designing advanced materials with novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved Density Accumulations in Orbital Hall Transport: Insights from Linear Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a linear response theory for stationary density accumulations in anomalous transport phenomena, such as the orbital Hall effect, where the transported density is odd under time reversal and the underlying charge is not conserved. Our framework applies to both metals and insulators, topologically trivial or nontrivial, and distinguishes between contributions from bulk and edge states, as well as undergap and dissipative currents. In time-reversal invariant systems, we prove a microscopic reciprocity theorem showing that only dissipative currents at the Fermi level contribute to density accumulation, while undergap currents do not. In contrast, in non-time-reversal invariant systems, non-dissipative density accumulations, such as magnetoelectric polarization, can appear in both the bulk and edges. Importantly, we find that the net density accumulation does not always vanish, pointing to a global non-conservation that implies a distributed ``torque''. We show that this distributed torque can be absorbed in the divergence of a redefined current that satisfies Onsager reciprocity. Finally, we apply our theory to two-dimensional models with edge terminations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect and optical magneto-conductivity of two-dimensional topological nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a gapped two-dimensional nodal-line semimetal subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. We identify an unusual pattern for Landau levels, where the energy of Landau levels first decreases and then starts increasing versus the level index. These descending/ascending Landau levels form a stretched check-mark shape. Tuning the magnitude of the magnetic field changes the spacing between Landau levels. At fixed chemical potential in the low doped regime, the Landau levels move below the chemical potential and get filled from one side, while they move out and get vacant from the other side. Using the Kubo formalism in the linear response theory, we analytically study a gapped nodal-line semimetal's longitudinal and Hall conductivities. In the DC limit, we observe that as the magnetic field is varied at a fixed chemical potential, the Chern number swings back and forth between two consecutive integer numbers, giving rise to bumpy Hall plateaus in a low-doped system. We also find that the longitudinal optical conductivity displays different series of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, corresponding to inter-band and intra-band transition among the descending and ascending sets of the Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Stacking engineering in orthogonally-twisted two-dimensional CrSBr magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>

      <title>PARPHOM: PARallel PHOnon calculator for Moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of a twist between two layers of two-dimensional materials has opened up a new and exciting field of research known as twistronics. In these systems, the phonon dispersions show significant renormalization and enhanced electron-phonon interactions as a function of the twist angle. However, the large system size of the resulting moir\'e patterns in these systems makes phonon calculations computationally challenging. In this paper, we present PARPHOM, a powerful code package designed to address these challenges. PARPHOM enables the generation of force constants, computation of phononic band structures, and determination of density of states in twisted 2D material systems. Moreover, PARPHOM provides essential routines to investigate the finite temperature dynamics in these systems and analyze the chirality of the phonon bands. This paper serves as an introduction to PARPHOM, highlighting its capabilities and demonstrating its utility in unraveling the intricate phononic properties of twisted 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mapping of smooth topographic landscapes produced by thermal scanning-probe lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a powerful technique for mapping nanoscale surface properties through tip-sample interactions. Thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) is an advanced SPM variant that uses a silicon tip on a heated cantilever to sculpt and measure polymer films with nanometer precision. The surfaces produced by tSPL-smooth topographic landscapes-allow mathematically defined contours to be fabricated on the nanoscale, enabling sophisticated functionalities for photonic, electronic, chemical, and biological technologies. Evaluating the physical effects of a landscape requires fitting arbitrary mathematical functions to SPM datasets, however, this capability does not exist in standard analysis programs. Here, we provide an open-source software package (FunFit) to fit analytical functions to SPM data and develop a fabrication and characterization protocol based on this analysis. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach by patterning periodic and quasiperiodic landscapes in a polymer resist with tSPL, which we transfer to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with high fidelity via reactive-ion etching. The topographic landscapes in polymers and hBN are measured with tSPL and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Within the FunFit program, the datasets are corrected for artefacts, fit with analytical functions, and compared, providing critical feedback on the fabrication procedure. Beyond application to tSPL, this protocol can improve analysis, reproducibility, and process development for a broad range of SPM experiments. The protocol can be performed within a working day by an inexperienced user, where fabrication and characterization take a few hours and software analysis takes a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Magnet-superconductor hybrid quantum systems: a materials platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have recently emerged as one of the most significant developments in condensed matter physics. This has generated, in the last decade, a steadily rising interest in the understanding of their unique properties. They have been proposed as one of the most promising platforms for the establishment of topological superconductivity, which holds high potential for application in future quantum information technologies. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) plays a crucial role in the race to unveil the fundamental origin of the unique properties of MSH systems, with the aim to discover new hybrid quantum materials capable of hosting topologically non-trivial unconventional superconducting phases. In particular, the combination of STM studies with tight-binding model calculations have represented, so far, the most successful approach to unveil and explain the emergent electronic properties of MSHs. The scope of this review is to offer a broad perspective on the field of MSHs from an atomic-level investigation point-of-view. The focus is on discussing the link between the magnetic ground state hosted by the hybrid system and the corresponding emergent superconducting phase. This is done for MSHs with both one-dimensional (atomic chains) and two-dimensional (atomic lattices and thin films) magnetic systems proximitized to conventional s-wave superconductors. We present a systematic categorization of the experimentally investigated systems with respect to defined experimentally accessible criteria to verify or falsify the presence of topological superconductivity and Majorana edge modes. Given the vast number of publications on the topic, we limit ourselves to discuss works which are most relevant to the search for topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal is apparently instantaneous with respect to the field and contains a linear (Pockels) and a quadratic (Kerr) components of comparable magnitude. The latter does not depend on the crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving oscillations with small dimensions, high power, high coherence, and low phase noise has been a long-standing goal in wave physics, driving innovations across classical electromagnetic theory and quantum physics. Key applications include electronic oscillators, lasers, and spin-torque oscillations. In recent decades, physicists have increasingly focused on harnessing passive oscillatory modes to manipulate these oscillations, leading to the development of diverse gain-loss coupled systems, including photon-photon, exciton-photon, photon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon-magnon couplings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems, exploring their fundamental physical structures, key experimental observations, and theoretical insights. By synthesizing insights from these studies, we propose future research directions to further advance the understanding and application of gain-loss coupled systems for quantum science and quantum technologies. (The field of gain-loss coupled systems is vast. The authors welcome suggestions and feedback from the community to continuously improve this review article until it is published).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of non-Markovian systems: Markovian embedding vs effective mass approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of non-Markovian systems is a classic problem yet it attracts an everlasting activity in physics and beyond. A powerful tool for modeling such setups is the Generalized Langevin Equation, however, its analysis typically poses a major challenge even for numerical means. For this reason, various approximations have been proposed over the years that simplify the original model. In this work we compare two methods allowing to tackle this great challenge: (i) the well-known and successful Markovian embedding technique and (ii) the recently developed effective mass approach. We discuss their scope of applicability, numerical accuracy, and computational efficiency. In doing so we consider a paradigmatic model of a free Brownian particle subjected to power-law correlated thermal noise. We show that when the memory time is short, the effective mass approach offers satisfying precision and typically is much faster than the Markovian embedding. Moreover, the concept of effective mass can be used to find optimal parameters allowing to reach supreme accuracy and minimal computational cost within the embedding. Our work therefore provides a blueprint for investigating the dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions as a resource for quantum science and technology in cold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions arise from atom-light interactions, which are universal and prevalent in a wide range of open quantum systems. This pairwise and long-range spin-exchange interaction results from multiple light scattering among the atoms. A recent surge of interests and progresses in both experiments and theories promises this core mechanism of collective interactions as a resource to study quantum science and to envision next-generation applications in quantum technology. Here we summarize recent developments in both theories and experiments, where we introduce several central theoretical approaches and focus on cooperative light scattering from small sample of free-space atoms, an atom-waveguide coupled interface that hosts the waveguide QED, and topological quantum optical platforms. The aim of this review is to manifest the essential and distinct features of collective dynamics induced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions and to reveal unprecedented opportunities in enhancing the performance or offering new applications in light manipulations, quantum metrology, quantum computations, and light harvesting innovations.</description>

      <title>Routing Light Emission from Monolayer MoS$_2$ by Mie Resonances of Crystalline Silicon Nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dielectric Mie-resonant nanoantenna is capable of controlling the directionality of the emission from nearby quantum emitters through the excitation of multiple degenerate Mie resonances. A crystalline silicon nanosphere (Si NS) is a promising candidate for a dielectric nanoantenna because crystalline Si has a large refractive index (3.8 at 650 nm) and the small imaginary part of a complex refractive index (0.015 at 650 nm) as an optical material. In this work, we control the emission directionality of excitons supported by monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMDCs) using a Si NS. We first discuss the condition to extract the emission preferentially towards the Si NS side from the analytical calculations. We then study the photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-TMDCs on which differently sized single Si NSs are placed. We show that the PL spectral shape strongly depends on the emission direction, and that the emission toward the Si NS side (top) with respect to the opposite side (bottom) is the largest at wavelengths between the magnetic dipole and electric dipole Mie resonances of a Si NS. Finally, we quantitatively discuss the spectral shape of the top-to-bottom ratio from numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Janus transition metal-dichalcogenide (JTMD) materials have attracted a great deal of attention due to their remarkable physical properties arising from the two-dimensional geometry and the breakdown of the out-of-plane symmetry. Using first-principles density functional theory, we investigated the phase stability, strain-enhanced phase stability, and superconductivity of Janus WSeH and WSH. In addition, we investigated the contribution of the phonon linewidths from the phonon energy spectrum responsible for the superconductivity, and the electron-phonon coupling as a function of phonon wave vectors and modes. Previous work has examined hexagonal 2H and tetragonal 1T structures, but we found that neither is a ground state structure. The metastable 2H phase of WSeH is dynamically stable with Tc around 11.60K, similar to WSH. Compressive biaxial strain - the 2D equivalent of pressure - can stabilize the 1T structures of WSeH and WSH with Tc around 9.23K and 10.52K, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evanescently coupled waveguide arrays provide a tabletop platform to realize a variety of Hamiltonians, where physical waveguides correspond to the individual sites of a tight-binding lattice. Nontrivial spatial structure of the waveguide modes enriches this picture and uncovers further possibilities. Here, we demonstrate that the effective coupling between $p$-like modes of adjacent photonic waveguides changes its sign depending on their relative orientation vanishing for a proper alignment at a so-called magic angle. Using femtosecond laser-written waveguides, we demonstrate this experimentally for $p$-mode dimers and graphene-like photonic lattices exhibiting quasi-flat bands at this angle. We observe diffraction-free propagation of corner and bulk states providing a robust experimental evidence of a two-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm-like caging in an optically switchable system.</description>

Abstract: A multiscale QM/classical approach is presented, that is able to model the optical properties of complex nanostructures composed of a molecular system adsorbed on metal nanoparticles. The latter are described by a combined atomistic-continuum model, where the core is described using the implicit boundary element method (BEM) and the surface retains a fully atomistic picture and is treated employing the frequency-dependent fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) approach. The integrated QM/$\omega$FQF$\mu$-BEM model is numerically compared with state-of-the-art fully atomistic approaches, and the quality of the continuum/core partition is evaluated. The method is then extended to compute Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) within a Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) framework.</description>

      <title>Terahertz chiral photonic-crystal cavities with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly, coupling with circularly polarized fields can break time-reversal symmetry, leading to topological modifications in the band structure. Therefore, chiral optical cavities that host chiral vacuum fields are being sought, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a novel approach to achieving THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) with high-quality factors (&gt;400) using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. Numerical simulations of an optimized structure based on InSb in a small perpendicular magnetic field (~0.2 T) show chiral cavity resonances with near-perfect ellipticity at the surfaces of the central dielectric layer, where one can place atomically thin materials like monolayer graphene. We theoretically estimate an energy gap on the order of 1 meV in graphene when coupled to our proposed chiral cavity, which is potentially measurable in experiments. These THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring new phases in cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals material ZrTe$_5$ is known as a candidate topological insulator (TI), however its topological phase and the relation with other properties such as an apparent Dirac semimetallic state is still a subject of debate. We employ a semiclassical multicarrier transport (MCT) model to analyze the magnetotransport of ZrTe$_5$ nanodevices at hydrostatic pressures up to 2 GPa. The temperature dependence of the MCT results between 10 and 300 K is assessed in the context of thermal activation, and we obtain the positions of conduction and valence band edges in the vicinity of the chemical potential. We find evidence of the closing and re-opening of the band gap with increasing pressure, which is consistent with a phase transition from weak to strong TI. This matches expectations from ab initio band structure calculations, as well as previous observations that CVT-grown ZrTe$_5$ is a weak TI in ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Fractal Surface States in Three-Dimensional Topological Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological states of matter in quasicrystals, which do not rely on crystalline orders. In the absence of a bandstructure description and spin-orbit coupling, we show that a three-dimensional quasicrystal can nevertheless form a topological insulator. It relies on a combination of noncrystallographic rotational symmetry of quasicrystals and electronic orbital space symmetry, which is the quasicrystalline counterpart of topological crystalline insulator. The resulting topological state obeys a non-trivial twisted bulk-boundary correspondence and lacks a good metallic surface. The topological surface states, localized on the top and bottom planes respecting the quasicrystalline symmetry, exhibit a new kind of multifractality with probability density concentrates mostly on high symmetry patches. They form a near-degenerate manifold of 'immobile' states whose number scales proportionally with the macroscopic sample size. This can open the door to a novel platform for topological surface physics distinct from the crystalline counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Separating heat from charge in a material is an extremely challenging task since they are transported by the very same carriers, i.e. electrons or holes. In this Letter we show that such separation can reach 100% efficiency in a hybrid superconducting quantum Hall setup, provided that the quantum Hall system is tuned to integer filling factor. We present microscopic calculations for a three-terminal setup to illustrate our idea.</description>

      <title>Entropy Driven Inductive Response of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and extended surface states exhibiting a helical spin texture. In this work, we investigate the hyperfine interaction between the spin-charge coupled transport of electrons and the nuclear spins in these surface states. Previous work has predicted that in the quantum spin Hall insulator phase, work can be extracted from a bath of polarized nuclear spins as a resource. We employ nonequilibrium Green's function analysis to show that a similar effect exists on the surface of a 3D topological insulator, albeit rescaled by the ratio between electronic mean free path and device length. The induced current due to thermal relaxation of polarized nuclear spins has an inductive nature. We emphasize the inductive response by rewriting the current-voltage relation in harmonic response as a lumped element model containing two parallel resistors and an inductor. In a low-frequency analysis, a universal inductance value emerges that is only dependent on the device's aspect ratio. This scaling offers a means of miniaturizing inductive circuit elements. An efficiency estimate follows from comparing the spin-flip induced current to the Ohmic contribution. The inductive effect is most prominent in topological insulators which have a large number of spinful nuclei per coherent segment, of which the volume is given by the mean free path length, Fermi wavelength and penetration depth of the surface state.</description>

      <title>Resonator-mediated quantum gate between distant charge qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong charge-photon coupling allows the coherent coupling of a charge qubit, realized by a single charge carrier (either an electron or a hole) in a double quantum dot, to photons of a microwave resonator. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the dispersive regime, the photons can mediate both an $i\mathrm{SWAP}$ gate as well as a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate between two distant charge qubits. We provide a thorough discussion of the impact of the dominant noise sources, resonator damping and charge qubit dephasing on the average gate fidelity. Assuming a state-of-the art resonator decay rate and charge qubit dephasing rate, the predicted average gate fidelities are below 90\%. However, a decrease of the charge qubit dephasing rate by one order of magnitude is conjectured to result in gate fidelities surpassing 95\%.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Wetting Dynamics of Water Nanodroplets on Nanotextured Titanium: Implications for Medical Implants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of high-performance biomedical implants requires a deep understanding of the molecular interactions between water molecules and titanium (Ti) surfaces. In this study, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the static and dynamic wetting behavior of water nanodroplets on both flat and femtosecond laser-induced nanotextured Ti surfaces. Our findings reveal a clear transition from Wenzel to Cassie-Baxter wetting states as surface roughness increases, significantly affecting droplet spreading. We also observe the damping of nanodroplet vibrations and a roughness-dependent shift toward hydrophobicity, driven by stronger atomic interactions between water molecules and surface atoms. Furthermore, the interaction energy between water droplets and nano-textured Ti surfaces decreases with increasing roughness, reinforcing the observed changes in wettability. The discrepancies observed between classical wetting models and nanoscale behavior emphasize the limitations of current theoretical approaches and the importance of developing more advanced models. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing Ti surface properties for improved implant performance through controlled wettability.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system, where the DQDs act as refrigerants to reduce the local phonon environment around computational qubits. The cooling process occurs in two distinct stages: the first step involves microwave-induced state depopulation combined with fast cyclic detuning to transfer the DQD's population to the ground state, effectively lowering the DQD's temperature. In the second step, the cooled DQD interacts with and absorbs phonons resonant with the DQD spin energy, thereby filtering out these phonons that contribute to spin-lattice relaxation in the surrounding environment. This study focuses on the first step, presenting detailed calculations and numerical results that demonstrate the feasibility of achieving local DQD temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The sensitivity of the cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time is analyzed, while the phonon filtering in the second step will require further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider longitudinal electronic transport in a graphene monolayer with an external in-plane magnetic field and with extrinsic spin-orbit Rashba interaction. Our main interest is in the in-plane magnetoresistance, observed experimentally. We show, that scattering on Rashba spin-orbit fluctuations leads to a negative magnetoresistance, in agreement with experimental observations. To calculate transport properties we assume an effective model valid for low energy states around the Dirac points, and use the Green function method to derive the electron scattering rate and longitudinal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Instability in domain wall dynamics in almost compensated ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale self-localized topological spin textures, such as domain walls and skyrmions, are of interest for the fundamental physics of magnets and spintronics applications. Ferrimagnets (FiMs), in the region close to the angular momentum compensation point, are promising materials because of their ultrafast spin dynamics at nonzero magnetization. In this work, we study specific features of the FiM domain wall (DW) dynamics, which are absent in both ferromagnets (FM) and antiferromagnets (AFM). In low-damping FMs and AFMs ($\alpha \ll 1$), the non-stationary forced motion of DWs is characterized by slow ($t_{diss}\propto 1/\alpha$) changes of the DW's velocity and internal structure for all accepted values of the DW energy $E$ and its linear momentum $P$ -- a consequence of the stability of DWs for any value of $P$. In contrast, the dispersion law of FiM DWs has specific points, $P=P_{cr}$ and $E_{cr}=E(P_{cr})$, such that stable DWs are only present for $P&lt;P_{cr}$, i.e., $P_{cr}$ and $E_{cr}$ act as endpoints in the $E(P)$ dependence. We show that when a field-like torque driven DW reaches this endpoint, it falls into a highly-non-equilibrium state with the excitation of fast ($t \ll t_{diss}$) and highly-nonlinear intra-wall magnetization dynamics, covering a wide frequency range up until the frequencies of propagating spin waves. The domain wall finally throws off an "excessive" energy by a short "burst" of the propagating spin waves and returns to the stationary state; the full picture of the forced motion is a periodic repetition of such "explosive" events.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Spurious Dot Formation in SiMOS Single Electron Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of spurious dots in SiMOS single-electron transistors (SETs), fabricated on an industrial 300 mm process line, has been statistically analyzed. To have a deeper understanding of the origin of these spurious dots, we analyzed SETs with three different oxide thicknesses: 8 nm, 12 nm and 20 nm. By combining spurious dot triangulation cryo-measurement with simulations of strain, gate bias, and location of the electron wave function, we demonstrate that most spurious dots are formed through the combined effects of strain and gate bias, leading to variations in the conduction band energy. Despite the similar thermal expansion coefficients of polycrystalline silicon gates and single-crystalline silicon substrates, strain remains a crucial factor in spurious dots formation. This learning can be use to optimize the device design and the oxide thickness, to reduce the density of spurious dot while keeping quantum dot tunability.</description>

      <title>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</description>

      <title>The Composite Particle Duality: A New Class of Topological Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood either as a theoretical framework or as a dynamical physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field. In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. In 3+1D the mechanism of flux attachment induces a dynamical formation of dyons as higher-dimensional analogues of Laughlin quasiparticles. In 1+1D there is lack of flux attachment but a remnant in the form of a statistical gauge field can be explicitly constructed. We also introduce a family of interacting quantum many-body systems that undergo statistical transmutation as indicated by the duality. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases across dimensions both in lattice and continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Composite quadrupole order in ferroic and multiferroic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 18 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM order parameter. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out of equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

Abstract: One of issues arising in materials science is a behavior of non-equilibrium point defects in the atomic lattice, which defines the rates of chemical reactions and relaxation processes as well as affects the physical properties of solids. It is previously theoretically predicted that melting and rapid solidification of metals and alloys provides a vacancy concentration in the quenched material, which can be comparable to that quantity at the point of melting. Here, the vacancy behavior is studied exerimentally in thin films of the near equiatomic Fe-Al alloy subjected to nanosecond laser annealing with intensities up to film ablation. The effects of laser irradiation are studied by monitoring magneto-optically the ordering kinetics in the alloy at the very ablation edge, within a narrow (micron-scale) ring-shaped region around the ablation zone. Quantitatively, the vacancy supersaturation in the quenched alloy has been estimated by fitting a simulated temporal evolution of the long-range chemical order to the obtained experimental data. Laser quenching (LQ) of alloys and single-element materials would be a tool for obtaining novel phase states within a small volume of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse magneto-conductance design by automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>The pathway to chirality in elemental tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, like chiral molecules, cannot be superimposed onto their mirror images -- a fundamental property that has been linked to interesting physical behavior and exploited in functional devices. Among the simplest inorganic systems with crystallographic chirality, elemental tellurium adopts crystal structures with right- or left-handed chains. However, understanding the formation mechanisms of those structures has been difficult due to the rapid crystallization of Te, which reaches the spatial and temporal resolution limits of even the most advanced experiments. Here, we report ultra-large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate simulations that reveal mechanisms of crystallization and the origin of crystallographic chirality in solid Te. We identify a characteristic, disordered cube-like structural motif -- a transient bonding environment with only nanosecond lifetime -- that enables both the rapid crystallization of Te and mediates chirality transfer. Based on the resulting microscopic understanding, we are able to explain the switching behavior of Te-based electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>
