      <title>Circuits as a simple platform for the emergence of hydrodynamics in deterministic chaotic many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamics is one of the deepest phenomena in many-body systems. Arguably, the hydrodynamic equations are also the most important tools for predicting large-scale behaviour. Understanding how such equations emerge from microscopic deterministic dynamics is a century-old problem, despite recent progress in fine-tuned integrable systems. Due to the universality of hydrodynamics, the specific microscopic implementation should not matter. Here, we show that classical deterministic circuits provide a minimal, exact, and efficient platform that admits non-trivial hydrodynamic behaviour for deterministic but chaotic systems. By developing new techniques and focusing on 1D circuits as a proof of concept, we obtain the characteristic dynamics, including relaxation to Gibbs states, exact Euler equations, shocks, diffusion, and exact KPZ super-diffusion. Our methods can be easily generalised to higher dimensions or quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network analysis of single trajectories switching between anomalous diffusion states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive dynamics abound in nature and have been especially studied in physical, biological, and financial systems. These dynamics are characterised by a linear growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time. Often, the conditions that give rise to simple diffusion are violated, and many systems, such as biomolecules inside cells, microswimmers, or particles in turbulent flows, undergo anomalous diffusion, featuring an MSD that grows following a power law with an exponent $\alpha$. Precisely determining this exponent and the generalised diffusion coefficient provides valuable information on the systems under consideration, but it is a very challenging task when only a few short trajectories are available, which is common in non-equilibrium and living systems. Estimating the exponent becomes overwhelmingly difficult when the diffusive dynamics switches between different behaviours, characterised by different exponents $\alpha$ or diffusion coefficients $K$. We develop a method based on recurrent neural networks that successfully estimates the anomalous diffusion exponents and generalised diffusion coefficients of individual trajectories that switch between multiple diffusive states. Our method returns the $\alpha$ and $K$ as a function of time and identifies the times at which the dynamics switches between different behaviours. We showcase the method's capabilities on the dataset of the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge.</description>

      <title>Dimension-raising phase transitions in driven magnets and condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a periodically driven system whose dimensionality is an emergent property that can be tunable, thus enables us to realize not only many-body phases with arbitrary dimensions, but also phase transitions, instead of crossovers, between phases with various dimensions. We study an interacting rotor model whose instantaneous Hamiltonian keeps the one-dimensional (1D) feature at any given time. Despite this, an emergent two-dimensional (2D) phase appears when the driving frequency exceeds a critical value, at which a dimension-raising phase transition takes place. We find that the nonequilibrium feature of the system could qualitatively change the finite temperature critical behavior of the emergent 2D phase and make it different from its equilibrium counterpart. A four-dimensional (4D) generalization and experimental realizations of the proposed model based on a programmable reconfiguration technique in optical tweezers setups have also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of Hilbert space fragmentation, freezing transition and its effects in the family of quantum East models involving varying ranges of facilitated hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q&gt;1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Limits of Local Operator Entanglement in Interacting Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the long-time behavior of Local Operator Entanglement entropy (LOE) in finite-size interacting integrable systems. For certain operators in the Rule 54 automaton, we prove that the LOE saturates to a value that is at most logarithmic in system size. The logarithmic bound relies on a feature of Rule 54 that does not generalize to other interacting integrable systems: namely, that there are only two types of quasiparticles, and therefore only two possible values of the phase shift between quasiparticles. We present a heuristic argument, supported by numerical evidence, that for generic interacting integrable systems (such as the Heisenberg spin chain) the saturated value of the LOE is volume-law in system size.</description>

      <title>Quantum systems of atoms with highly singular interaction potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum statistical systems, composed of atoms or molecules interacting with each other through highly singular non-integrable potentials, are considered. The treatment of such systems cannot start with the standard approximations such as Hartree, Hartree-Fock or Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximations because of non-integrability of the interaction potentials leading to divergences. It is shown that the iterative procedure for Green functions can be rearranged so that the starting approximation takes into account regularizing atomic correlations. Then all the following approximation orders contain only the regularized interaction potential producing no divergences. The method of constructing the regularizing correlation function is suggested, based on the solution of the scattering equation in the form of asymptotic series at short distance, which can be extrapolated to arbitrary spatial variables by means of self-similar approximation theory. Regularizing correlation functions for several kinds of atomic systems are exemplified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of entropy and temperature is equivalent to a conservation law, which expresses the decoupling of hidden contributions to energy from the measurable ones with respect to some set of measurement procedures. We then apply this technique to define entropy and temperature in an arbitrary dynamical system, where a reduction procedure is specified that recovers the full geometric structure of thermodynamic phase space.</description>

      <title>Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonians of one-dimensional, disordered single-particle systems with long-range hopping terms can naturally be modeled by power-law banded random matrices. In this picture, the phase diagram of a power-law banded random matrix ensemble show ergodic, weakly ergodic, multifractal, and localized phases. Motivated by recent developments on ergodicity breaking and localization in interacting quantum many-body systems, we explore many-body interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix ensemble. We discuss a number of ways to label the basis vectors with many-body configurations, and compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians. We characterize the scaling of the many-body eigenstate entanglement entropy with system size for the different labeling schemes and in each of the phases. Using a scaling analysis on the full sets of eigenstates, we subsequently provide a quantitative picture of the boundary between the different types of scaling behavior that we observe for the spectral-bulk and spectral-edge eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Large-scale multifractality and lack of self-similar decay for Burgers and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decaying turbulence in the 1D Burgers equation (Burgulence) and 3D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. We first investigate the decay in time $t$ of the energy $E(t)$ in Burgulence, for a fractional Brownian initial potential, with Hurst exponent $H$, and demonstrate rigorously a self-similar time-decay of $E(t)$, previously determined heuristically. This is a consequence of the nontrivial boundedness of the energy for any positive time. We define a spatially forgetful \textit{oblivious fractional Brownian motion} (OFBM), with Hurst exponent $H$, and prove that Burgulence, with an OFBM as initial potential $\varphi_0(x)$, is not only intermittent, but it also displays, a hitherto unanticipated, large-scale bifractality or multifractality; the latter occurs if we combine OFBMs, with different values of $H$. This is the first rigorous proof of genuine multifractality for turbulence in a nonlinear hydrodynamical partial differential equation. We then present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of freely decaying turbulence, capturing some aspects of this multifractality. For Burgulence, we investigate such decay for two cases: (A) $\varphi_0(x)$ a multifractal random walk that crosses over to a fractional Brownian motion beyond a crossover scale $\mathcal{L}$, tuned to go from small- to large-scale multifractality; (B) initial energy spectra $E_0(k)$, with wavenumber $k$, having one or more power-law regions, which lead, respectively, to self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Our analogous DNSs of the 3D NS equations also uncover self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Challenges confronting the detection of genuine large-scale multifractality, in numerical and experimental studies of NS and MHD turbulence, are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks and identify two distinct universality classes governing their spreading dynamics. Using analytical arguments and large-scale simulations of the susceptible-infected (SI) model, we show that epidemic prevalence follows either a Gompertz-like curve in small-world networks or an Avrami-like curve in fractal complex networks. These findings challenge the traditional mean-field prediction of early-stage exponential growth of infections and highlight the crucial role of network topology in shaping epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the widely used mean-field approximation, even in its heterogeneous form, fails to accurately describe epidemic spreading, as the assumption of early exponential growth is not justified in either universality class. Additionally, we show that in fractal networks, the basic reproduction number loses its traditional predictive power, as the spreading dynamics are instead governed by microscopic scaling exponents of the network's self-similar structure. This shift underscores the need to revise classical epidemiological models when applied to systems with fractal topology. Our findings provide a refined theoretical framework for modeling spreading processes in complex networks, offering new perspectives for epidemic prediction and control.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone.

      <title>Survival probability and position distribution of a run and tumble particle in $U(x)=\alpha |x|$ potential with an absorbing boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the late time exponential decay of the survival probability $S_\pm(t,a|x_0)\sim e^{-\theta(a)t}$, of a one-dimensional run and tumble particle starting from $x_0&lt;a$ with an initial orientation $\sigma(0)=\pm 1$, under a confining potential $U(x)=\alpha|x|$ with an absorbing boundary at $x=a&gt;0$. We find that the decay rate $\theta(a)$ of the survival probability has strong dependence on the location $a$ of the absorbing boundary, which undergoes a freezing transition at a critical value $a=a_c=(v_0-\alpha)\sqrt{v_0^2-\alpha^2}/(2\alpha\gamma)$, where $v_0&gt;\alpha$ is the self-propulsion speed and $\gamma$ is the tumbling rate of the particle. For $a&gt;a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ increases monotonically from zero, as $a$ decreases from infinity, till it attains the maximum value $\theta(a_c)$ at $a=a_c$. For $0&lt;a&lt;a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ freezes to the value $\theta(a)=\theta(a_c)$. We also obtain the propagator with the absorbing boundary condition at $x=a$. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically, the distribution of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on a $k \times L$ strip in the complex activity (z) plane. Using transfer matrix methods, we find that our results match the analytical predictions of Heilmann and Leib for $k = 2$. However, for $k = 3$, the zeros are confined within a bounded region, suggesting a fundamental difference in critical behavior. This indicates that trimers belong to a distinct universality class in some finite geometries. We observe that the density of zeros along multiple line segments in the complex plane reveals a richer structure than in the dimer case. {Our findings emphasize the role of geometric constraints in shaping the statistical mechanics of $k$-mer models and set the stage for further studies in higher-dimensional lattices.</description>

Abstract: We connect self-interacting processes, that is, stochastic processes where transitions depend on the time spent by a trajectory in each configuration, to Doob conditioning. In this way we demonstrate that Markov processes with constrained occupation measures are realised optimally by self-interacting dynamics. We use a tensor network framework to guide our derivations. We illustrate our general results with new perspectives on well-known examples of self-interacting processes, such as random walk bridges, excursions, and forced excursions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines have undergone extensive studies over the last two decades. Simultaneously, the studies of the applications of stochastic resetting in various fields are on the rise. We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. However, the effective efficiency that includes the work expended in resetting is shown to exhibit a steady decay with the increase in resetting rate. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.</description>

      <title>Loewner Evolution for Critical Invasion Percolation Tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the Schramm--Loewner Evolution (SLE) to model branching structures while preserving conformal invariance and other stochastic properties remains a formidable research challenge. Unlike simple paths, branching structures, or trees, must be associated with discontinuous driving functions. Moreover, the driving function of a particular tree is not unique and depends on the order in which the branches are explored during the SLE process. This study investigates trees formed by nontrapping invasion percolation (NTIP) within the SLE framework. Three strategies for exploring a tree are employed: the invasion percolation process itself, Depth--First Search (DFS), and Breadth--First Search (BFS). We analyze the distributions of displacements of the Loewner driving functions and compute their spectral densities. Additionally, we investigate the inverse problem of deriving new traces from the driving functions, achieving a reasonably accurate reconstruction of the tree-like structures using the BFS and NTIP methods. Our results suggest the lack of conformal invariance in the exploration paths of the trees, as evidenced by the non-Brownian nature of the driving functions for the BFS and NTIP methods, and the inconsistency of the diffusion constants for the DFS method.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay the mathematical foundations of the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and physical contact forces. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike crystalline solids, liquids lack long-range order, resulting in diffusive shear fluctuations rather than propagating waves. Simulations predict that liquids exhibit a $k$-gap in wave-vector space, where solid-like transverse waves reappear above this gap. Experimental evidence in classical liquids has been limited, observed only in 2D dusty plasmas. Here, we investigate this phenomenon using active Brownian vibrators and uncover distinct gas-like and liquid-like phases depending on the packing fraction. We measure key properties, including pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, and vibrational density of states. In the liquid-like phase, we confirm the $k$-gap in transverse excitations, whose size grows as the packing fraction decreases and eventually disappears in the gas phase. Our findings extend the concept of the $k$-gap to active granular systems and reveal striking parallels with supercritical fluids.</description>

Abstract: We numerically analyze the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two distinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the static flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. We derived scaling laws for the velocity profile and surface layer thickness using dimensional analysis applied to the continuum equations. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get strongly correlated due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how external stimuli propagate in neural systems is an important challenge in the fields of neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics. Despite extensive studies over several decades, this problem remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a simple ``toy model'' of an excitable medium, a linear chain of diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, and analyze the transmission of a sinusoidal signal injected into one of the neurons at the ends of the chain. We measure to what extent the propagation of the wave reaching the opposite end is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the signal, the number of neurons in the chain and the strength of their mutual diffusive coupling. To quantify these effects, we measure the cross-correlation between the time-series of the membrane potentials of the end neurons. This measure allows us to detect the values of the parameters that delimit different propagation regimes.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same packing fractions, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases</title>

Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>

      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>
