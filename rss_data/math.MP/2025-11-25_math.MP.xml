      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a Family of Painlev\'e Functions with Applications to CUE Derivative Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlev\'e functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math. Physics. 2(2021), 613-642, Remark 2.5] concerning the existence of a probability density for a random variable arising in the ergodic decomposition of Hua-Pickrell measures.</description>

      <title>Factorization for the matrix-valued general Jacobi system on the full-line lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacobi system with matrix-valued coefficients and with the spectral parameter depending on a matrix-valued weight factor is considered on the full-line lattice. The scattering from the full-line lattice is expressed in terms of the scattering from the fragments of the whole lattice by developing a factorization formula for the corresponding transition matrices. In particular, the matrix-valued transmission and reflection coefficients for the full-line lattice are explicitly expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for the left and right lattice fragments. Since the matrix-valued scattering coefficients are easier to determine for the fragments than for the full-line lattice, the factorization formula presented provides a method to determine the scattering coefficients for full-line lattices. The theory presented is illustrated with various explicit examples, including an example demonstrating that the matrix-valued left transmission coefficient in general is not equal to the matrix-valued right transmission coefficient for a lattice.</description>

      <title>A Chiral Adelic Dirac Operator and the Spectral Realization of the Riemann Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a chiral adelic operator framework in which the functional--equation symmetry of global $L$--functions is realized directly in the spectrum of a Dirac--type Hamiltonian. Working on the id\`ele class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--P\'olya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow.</description>

      <title>General relativistic Lagrangian continuum theories -- Part II: electromagnetic fluids and solids with junction conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a covariant variational framework for relativistic electromagnetic continua (fluids and solid) based on Hamilton's principle formulated directly in the material description. The approach extends the geometric theory of relativistic continua introduced in Part I to include polarization, magnetization, and general elastic-electromagnetic coupling through a unified energy functional. By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks. We also offer systematic connections with several formulations appearing in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>An example of algebraically general para-K\"ahler Einstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraically general para-K\"ahler Einstein spaces equipped with 3D algebras of infinitesimal symmetries are considered. It is shown that if the algebra contains 2D trivial subalgebra then vacuum Einstein field equations with cosmological constant can be reduced to a single, first-order differential equation. One of the cases is solved explicitly. Hence, a first example of an algebraically general para-K\"ahler Einstein space is given.</description>

      <title>The continuum limit of some products of random matrices associated with renewing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the continuum limit of some products of random matrices in $\text{SL}(d,{\mathbb R})$ that arise as discretisations of incompressible renewing flows -- that is, of flows corresponding to a divergence-free velocity field that takes independent, identically-distributed values in successive time intervals of duration proportional to $\tau$. The statistical properties of the product are encoded in its generalised Lyapunov exponent whose computation reduces to finding the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator. In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(\tau^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible. For $d=2$, we compute the growth rate of the product in terms of complete elliptic integrals. By letting the elliptic modulus vary, we obtain a spectral problem, corresponding to a modulus-dependent random renewing flow, which may be viewed as a perturbation of the spectral problem for the angular Laplacian. In this way, we deduce expansions for the generalised Lyapunov exponent in ascending powers of the modulus. These expansions generalise to the case $d \ge 2$, and we compute the first few terms explicitly for $d \in \{2,3\}$.</description>

      <title>Symbolic computation of optimal systems of subalgebras of three- and four-dimensional real Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete optimal systems of subalgebras of all nonisomorphic three- and four-dimensional real Lie algebras are analyzed by the program SymboLie running in the computer algebra system Wolfram Mathematica\texttrademark. The approach uses the definition of $p$-families of Lie subalgebras whose set can be partitioned by introducing a binary relation (reflexive and transitive, though not necessarily symmetric) induced by inner automorphisms of the Lie algebra. The results, produced in a few minutes by SymboLie, represent a good test for the program; in fact, except for minor differences that are discussed, the results confirm those given in 1977 in a paper by Patera and Winternitz.</description>

      <title>Non-Symplectic Deformations of Geometric Quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of geometric pseudo-quantisation based on geometric quantisation with a weakened curvature condition. We show how such a structure arises naturally from simple deformations of the symplectic structure and pullbacks of prequantum data by non-symplectic diffeomorphisms. Our main result is deriving the equations of motion for some simple pseudo-quantisations. We also compute the pseudo-quantisation of several simple examples from symplectic and almost-symplectic geometry, as well as the general form of the resulting deformed canonical commutator.</description>

      <title>Projective deduction of the non-trivial first integral to the Euler problem: an explicit computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity of Kepler Laws for the {\it spherical Kepler problem} -- namely, the problem of the motion of a particle on the unit sphere {in $\mathbb R^3$} undergoing an attraction by another particle in the sphere, tangent to the geodesic line between the two and inversely proportional to its squared length -- prompted geometers to try to interpret such system as a '' projection'' of the familiar Kepler problem in the plane, with the hosting plane given by some affine plane in $\mathbb R^3$. At this respect, the most convenient mutual sphere-plane position has been object of a long debate, an account of which can be found in \cite{Albouy2013}. This fascinating topic, resumed %subject, firstly by A. Albouy in the aforementioned paper, has been expanded from the theoretical side in \cite{Albouy2015}. Further investigations recently appeared in \cite{AlbouyZhao2019, Zhao1, TakeuchiZhao1, TakeuchiZhao2}. As remarked in \cite{Albouy2013, Albouy2015}, extensions of the procedure to more dynamical systems would open to the possibility of finding first integrals to a given dynamical system simply looking at the energy of the mirror problem. In this note, we focus on the case of the problem of two fixed centers, already mentioned in \cite{Albouy2013}. We provide a{n explicit} geometrical construction allowing to interpret the first integral of the problem as the energy of its projection on an ellipsoid. Compared to previous papers on the same subject, ours -- besides being based on a somehow different construction -- includes complete explicit computations. {A byproduct of our construction is the existence of two integrable mirror problems (equivalently, three quadratic integrals, including the energy) for the Kepler problem, which is an aspect of its super-integrability.</description>

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermal quantum field theory, the global Liouvillian (the generator of time translations) is passive. How is this reflected in the properties of its local density, a quantum field? We propose that the locally averaged density is bounded below, but not above, with respect to the noncommutative $L^4$ norm. This is analogous to the known quantum energy inequalities in the vacuum situation. Our examples include thermal equilibrium on Minkowski space, and the Unruh effect on the Rindler wedge, both for the real scalar free field.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum of a periodic non-self-adjoint Dirac operator, and its dependence on a semiclassical parameter is also considered. Several bounds on the spectrum are obtained which provide sharp spectral enclosure estimates. Importantly, a sufficient condition is obtained which ensures semiclassical spectral confinement to the real axis and a bounded subset of the imaginary axis of the spectral plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic dynamics of open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. We find an explicit expression for the attractor subspace and the dynamics that takes place in it. We present the relationship between the attractor subspaces in the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures and, in particular, the connection between their algebraic structures. An unfolding theorem of the asymptotics, as well as the fine structure of the recently introduced Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra, are also discussed. Finally, we show how to extend all the results to the class of Schwarz maps.</description>

      <title>Accelerated optimization of measured relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropy and measured R\'enyi relative entropy are quantifiers of the distinguishability of two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$. They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or R\'enyi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $\rho$ and $\sigma$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $\beta$-smooth and $\gamma$-strongly convex / concave, where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured R\'enyi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060], and for well conditioned states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, these algorithms are notably faster.</description>

      <title>Attractor Subspace and Decoherence-Free Algebra of Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review we discuss some results on the asymptotic dynamics of finite-dimensional open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. Both the spectral and algebraic approaches to this topic are addressed, with particular emphasis on their relationship. The analysis is conducted in both the discrete-time and the continuous-time Markovian settings. In the final part of the work, some issues emerging in the infinite-dimensional case are also discussed. In particular, we provide an example of a Markovian evolution whose decoherence-free algebra is a type III von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness to nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Gerdjikov-Ivanon equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach is extended to discuss the well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Gerdjikov-Ivanon equation. The Lipschitz continuity of potential in $H^{2}(\mathbb{R})\cap H^{1,1}(\mathbb{R})$ to scattering data is obtained through direct scattering transform. Two Riemann-Hilbert problems are constructed, and two sets of the reflection coefficients, that is $r(k)$ and $r_\pm(z)$, are introduced. The Lipschitz continuity from the reflection coefficients $r_\pm(z)$ in $H^{1}(\mathbb{R})\cap L^{2,1}(\mathbb{R})$ to the potential is estimated via the potential reconstruction. Existence of global solutions of NLS-GI equation is considered by the Riemann-Hilbert problem without eigenvalues or resonances.</description>

      <title>Variations of the Hardy Z-Function and the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct linearisation scheme, based on an elliptic Cauchy kernel, is set up for the lattice CKP equation. This leads to an elliptic parametrisation of the lattice CKP equation, together with its Lax triplet, which allows us to perform appropriate continuum limits and construct elliptic solutions. By selecting appropriate integration measures and domains for the singular linear integral equation in the scheme, elliptic multi-soliton solutions of the lattice CKP equation are found.</description>

      <title>Topological interface modes in aperiodic subwavelength resonator chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interface modes in block disordered subwavelength resonator chains in one dimension. Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters. We also illustrate our results from a dynamic perspective, which provides an explicit geometric picture of the interface modes, and finally present a variety of numerical results to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Overlap distribution of spherical spin glass models with general eigenvalue distribution of the interaction matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the replica symmetry of the Gibbs measure of spherical spin systems is a property of the eigenvalue spacing at the edge of the interaction matrix. In particular, our interaction matrix has \textbf{two} large outlier eigenvalues with mutual distance $\frac{c}{n}$. The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model. In our limited understanding, we believe that this kind of phenomenon cannot be explained by the Parisi approach.</description>

      <title>Evolving criticality in iterative bicolored percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Criticality is traditionally regarded as an unstable, fine-tuned fixed point of the renormalization group. We introduce an iterative bicolored percolation process in two dimensions and show that it can both preserve and transform criticality. Starting from critical configurations, such as the O$(n)$ loop and fuzzy Potts models, successive coarse-graining generates a hierarchy of distinct yet critical generations. Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Grassmann-Pfaffian Framework for Monomer-Dimer and Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables that establishes master identities for exponential quadratic fermionic forms and linear fermionic forms coupled to both bosonic and fermionic sources. The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .</description>

      <title>Neural network approximation of regularized density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to soft and hard edge universality for random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to universality of local scaling limits for eigenvalues of random normal matrices, or equivalently for planar Coulomb gases at inverse temperature $\beta=2$. The approach is direct in that it does not rely on expressing the kernels in terms of orthogonal polynomials. There are three main results. The first is a proof of universality at hard edges with no symmetry assumptions on either the potential or the hard edge. We also prove local universality at regular soft edges for droplets with several components, and lastly for soft/hard edges where a hard edge perfectly aligns with the droplet boundary. The main ingredients are Paley-Wiener type spectral embeddings for the Hilbert space associated with a limiting kernel, and the construction of weighted polynomials peaking near a given boundary point.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove an optimal global rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues of the Jacobi unitary ensemble. Our approach begins by constructing a random measure defined through the eigenvalue counting function. We then prove its convergence to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure, which leads to the desired rigidity result. To establish this convergence, we apply a sufficient condition from Claeys et al. \cite{CFL2021} and conduct an asymptotic analysis of the related exponential moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider self-similar, radially symmetric solutions of the relativistic Euler equations with constitutive relations from relativistic kinetic theory, based on Synge energies for monatomic and its extension to diatomic gases. For the corresponding initial--boundary value problem, including the spherical piston problem, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions valid for all values of the relativistic parameter $\gamma = mc^{2}/(k_{B}T)$, thus covering both the classical limit $(\gamma \to \infty)$ and the ultra-relativistic regime $(\gamma \to 0)$. We further establish key structural properties of Synge energies, showing the strict negativity of the second derivative with respect to pressure at constant entropy and the monotone dependence of the characteristic velocity on $\gamma$. These results extend the classical theory of self-similar flows to the relativistic framework with kinetic-theory-based constitutive equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows one to derive quantum theory as a Hamilton-Killing flow on the cotangent bundle of a statistical manifold. These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles. As a test that despite its unorthodox foundation the ED approach is empirically successful we derive the Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling limits at the spectral singularity of structured random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical spectral distribution of Hermitian $K \times K$-block random matrices converges to a deterministic density on the real line with a potential atom at the origin as the dimension of the blocks tends to infinity. In this model the variances of the entries depends on the block and the limiting density is determined by these variances. In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity. The scaling limits depend only on the zero pattern within the variance profile, but not on the values of its positive entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Gay and Kirby's description of 4-manifolds in terms of trisections and trisection diagrams to define a new 4-manifold invariant. The algebraic data are an indecomposable finite semisimple bimodule category over a pair of spherical fusion categories, equipped with a bimodule trace, and a pivotal functor from another spherical fusion category into the spherical fusion category of its bimodule endofunctors and natural transformations between them. The 4-manifold invariant has a simple description in terms of a diagrammatic calculus for this data, in which the three spherical fusion categories correspond to the three colours of the trisection diagram.
  It includes the Hopf algebraic 4-manifold invariants by Chaidez, Cotler and Cui, which arise when the bimodule category is the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. We also recover the 4-manifold invariants of B\"arenz and Barrett defined by a pivotal functor from a spherical fusion category into a modular fusion category.</description>

  explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative
  decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol
  regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal
  decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative
  and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion
  parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal
  spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation
  is analyzed via H\"ormander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product
  of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix
  retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane,
  reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow.
  The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic
  and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the
  sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are
  given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We review the basic features of a logarithmic conformal field theory that arise in the context of the scaling limit of lattice models. The theory of interest is the symplectic fermions, whose central charge is $-2$. We provide an explicit construction of its space of fields as a logarithmic Fock space, and discuss its logarithmic structure as a representation of the Virasoro algebra. The construction of the correlation functions is presented following the ideas of the bootstrap approach. The text aims to be accessible to readers with little or no expertise in conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Response of Gapless $1d$ and Quasi-$1d$ Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transport properties of non-interacting, gapless one-dimensional quantum systems and of the edge modes of two-dimensional topological insulators, in the presence of time-dependent perturbations. We prove the validity of Kubo formula, in the zero temperature and infinite volume limit, for a class of perturbations that are weak and slowly varying in space and in time, in an Euler-like scaling. The proof relies on the representation of the real time Duhamel series in imaginary time, which allows to prove its convergence uniformly in the scaling parameter and in the size of system, at low temperatures. Furthermore, it allows to exploit a suitable cancellation for the scaling limit of the model, related to the emergent anomalous chiral gauge symmetry of relativistic one-dimensional fermions. The cancellation implies that, as the temperature and the scaling parameter are sent to zero, the linear response is the only contribution to the full response of the system. The explicit form of the leading contribution to the response function is determined by lattice conservation laws. In particular, the method allows to prove the quantization of the edge conductance of $2d$ quantum Hall systems from quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice. We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance. Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</description>

      <title>Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>The geometric deformation of curved $L_\infty$ algebras and Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While $L_\infty$ algebras are fundamental structures in differential geometry and mathematical physics, the geometric information encoded in such structures is often implicit. We address the following question: What constitutes a geometrically meaningful deformation of an $L_\infty$ algebra arising from vector bundles, and how can such deformations classify new geometric invariants?
  Inspired by nonabelian extension theory of Lie algebras, we define geometric deformations of curved $L_\infty$ algebras constructed from a vector bundle $V\to M$, and demonstrate that such deformations uniquely correspond to Lie algebroid structures on $V$. Explicit computations reveal that the first Atiyah-Chern class, expressible via deformed $L_\infty$ brackets, transgresses to the de Rham coboundary of the modular class. In the case of action Lie algebroids, the leading-order Atiyah-Chern classes correspond to the equivariant Chern characters.
  Applications to BV theories show that the geometric deformations naturally generate Poisson sigma models. These results provide a coherent framework for deriving field theories from geometric deformations of $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>Non-linear conductances of Galton-Watson trees and application to the (near) critical random cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study concave recursions on trees, which appear widely in information theory through algorithms such as belief propagation, and in statistical mechanics through models on tree-like graphs, including the Ising model, percolation, and more generally, the random cluster model. These tree recursions can, in fact, be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton--Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p&gt;1$, for a quenched realization of $T_n$. In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on $T_n$ (with cluster weight parameter in $(0,2]$ and wired boundary condition) providing sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite third moment; (ii) $n^{-1/(\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\alpha \in (1,3)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Gaps, Arithmetic Localization, and Reducibility via Resonance Analys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes several sharp spectral results for analytic quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators. Key contributions include: (1) exact exponential decay rates for spectral gaps of the almost Mathieu operator, addressing a question raised by Goldstein; (2) sharp arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic operators on higher-dimensional lattices, which in particular resolves and generalizes Jitomirskaya's phase transition conjecture; and (3) stratified growth patterns for extended eigenfunctions revealing universal partial hierarchical structures for subcritical quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators.
  The proofs are based on novel frameworks-structured quantitative almost reducibility and sharp quantitative duality-to overcome the longstanding challenge of taming infinitely many rotation-number resonances, which enables us to obtain optimal arithmetic reducibility results for analytic SL(2,R)-cocycles, thereby solving another Jitomirskaya's conjecture. These methods enable a first comprehensive treatment of resonance-driven dynamical asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of 3D Out-flowing Compressible Viscous Fluid under Non-Spherical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an outflow problem for the $3$-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of the unit ball $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^3\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$ and it is flowing out from the unit ball $\Omega$ at a constant speed $|u_b|$, in the normal direction to the boundary surface $\partial\Omega$. The existence of a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ is obtained by I.~Hashimoto and A.~Matsumura in 2021, provided that the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, and $|u_b|$ is sufficiently small. Subsequently, authors of the present article prove in 2024 that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ is time-asymptotically stable under large spherically symmetric initial perturbations in the suitable Sobolev norm. The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate the case when the initial perturbations are possibly non-spherically symmetric. We show that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ remains asymptotically stable in time, under general small initial perturbations in the $H^3$-norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study bipartite quantum states that are invariant under the local action of the cyclic sign group. Due to symmetry, these states are sparse and can be parameterized by a triple of vectors. Their important semi-definite properties, such as positivity and positivity under partial transpose (PPT), can be simply characterized in terms of these vectors and their discrete Fourier transforms. We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. In local dimension d &lt;= 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. We construct a new family of states for which the properties of PPT and separability can be characterized for all dimensions, generalizing results from the literature. Our results show that this class of symmetric states has a rich entanglement structure, even in the bosonic subspace.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity: Exact analytic solution for the power-law case $f(Q) = Q + b \: Q^\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>The Dirac--Bergmann approach to optimal control theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for optimal control in both classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin Principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications. In the latter example, both closed and open quantum systems are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</description>

      <title>An Effective Model for Droplet Impact Dynamics on Micro-Structured Surfaces: Nonlocal Theory and SPH Simulation of Pancake Bouncing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct effective mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Absence of local conserved charges of the Fredkin spin chain and its truncated versions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.</description>

      <title>On quantum Sobolev spaces consisting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study quantum Sobolev spaces whose elements are operators of the Hilbert-Schmidt class. We construct these Sobolev spaces from the Fourier transform for operators. Next, we obtain continuous embedding theorems. Finally, we delve into solving partial differential equations where the unknown is an operator. The results have potential applications in quantum physics, providing a new theoretical basis for relevant research.</description>

      <title>On the de Almeida--Thouless Transition Surface in the Multi-Species SK Model with Centered Gaussian External Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transition of the Parisi formula for the free energy in the multi-species Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model with a centered Gaussian external field and a positive-semidefinite variance profile matrix. We show that in terms of the strength of the external field and the variance profile, the de Almeida--Thouless surface delineates the boundary between replica symmetric solutions and replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first rigorous one-loop proof of quantum stability for BPS membranes in the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD). Exploiting the closure of restricted $\kappa$-symmetry with RVPD ensures that the BRST complex terminates without an infinite ghost tower, keeping the gauge-fixed measure analytically controllable.
  Our main result establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes remain stable, while the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode.
  Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero-modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies relations to BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for RVPD-based extensions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds for the canonical momentum uncertainty of scalar quantum states that are strictly localized in geodesic balls $B_{\Sigma}(p,r)$, serving as the position uncertainty, on spacelike hypersurfaces $(\Sigma,h)$ of arbitrary Lorentzian spacetimes. The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</description>

      <title>On quantum large sieve inequalities and operator recovery from incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain large sieve type inequalities for the Rayleigh quotient of the restriction of phase space representations of higher rank operators, via an operator analogue of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of (finite-rank) compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\Omega $: If $\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.</description>

      <title>The One-Loop QCD $\beta$-Function as an Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

      <title>Spectral torsion of the internal noncommutative geometry of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>
