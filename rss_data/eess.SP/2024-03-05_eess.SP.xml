      <title>Diffraction and Scattering Aware Radio Map and Environment Reconstruction using Geometry Model-Assisted Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) facilitates rapid channel modeling for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. Many existing ML techniques utilize a city map to construct the radio map; however, an updated city map may not always be available. This paper proposes to employ the received signal strength (RSS) data to jointly construct the radio map and the virtual environment by exploiting the geometry structure of the environment. In contrast to many existing ML approaches that lack of an environment model, we develop a virtual obstacle model and characterize the geometry relation between the propagation paths and the virtual obstacles. A multi-screen knife-edge model is adopted to extract the key diffraction features, and these features are fed into a neural network (NN) for diffraction representation. To describe the scattering, as oppose to most existing methods that directly input an entire city map, our model focuses on the geometry structure from the local area surrounding the TX-RX pair and the spatial invariance of such local geometry structure is exploited. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing a 3D virtual environment, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in radio map construction with 10%-18% accuracy improvements. It can also reduce 20% data and 50% training epochs when transferred to a new environment.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Clustered Cell-Free Networking with Access Point Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-densely deploying access points (APs) to support the increasing data traffic would significantly escalate the cell-edge problem resulting from traditional cellular networks. By removing the cell boundaries and coordinating all APs for joint transmission, the cell-edge problem can be alleviated, which in turn leads to unaffordable system complexity and channel measurement overhead. A new scalable clustered cell-free network architecture has been proposed recently, under which the large-scale network is flexibly partitioned into a set of independent subnetworks operating parallelly. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient clustered cell-free networking problem with AP selection. Specifically, we propose a user-centric ratio-fixed AP-selection based clustering (UCR-ApSel) algorithm to form subnetworks dynamically. Following this, we analyze the average energy efficiency achieved with the proposed UCR-ApSel scheme theoretically and derive an effective closed-form upper-bound. Based on the analytical upper-bound expression, the optimal AP-selection ratio that maximizes the average energy efficiency is further derived as a simple explicit function of the total number of APs and the number of subnetworks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived optimal AP-selection ratio and show that the proposed UCR-ApSel algorithm with the optimal AP-selection ratio achieves around 40% higher energy efficiency than the baselines. The analysis provides important insights to the design and optimization of future ultra-dense wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal reconstruction of substance dynamics using compressed sensing in multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of our study is to observe dynamics of multiple substances in vivo with high temporal resolution from multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively separate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial distributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying substance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the measurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances from randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed sensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of substances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and temporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to perform CS. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom data sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing amounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the metabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed results are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can reconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal resolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with that of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge naturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is independent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the acquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the underlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired in the future.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fairness for FAS-assisted Communication Systems: from NOMA to OMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the fairness issue within fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems, where a single fixed-antenna base station (BS) transmits superposition-coded signals to two users, each with a single fluid antenna. We define fairness through the minimization of the maximum outage probability for the two users, under total resource constraints for both FAS-assisted NOMA and OMA systems. Specifically, in the FAS-assisted NOMA systems, we study both a special case and the general case, deriving a closed-form solution for the former and applying a bisection search method to find the optimal solution for the latter. Moreover, for the general case, we derive a locally optimal closed-form solution to achieve fairness. In the FAS-assisted OMA systems, to deal with the non-convex optimization problem with coupling of the variables in the objective function, we employ an approximation strategy to facilitate a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm, achieving locally optimal solutions for both cases. Empirical analysis validates that our proposed solutions outperform conventional NOMA and OMA benchmarks in terms of fairness.</description>

      <title>A Cluster-Based Statistical Channel Model for Integrated Sensing and Communication Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging 6G network envisions integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a promising solution to meet growing demand for native perception ability. To optimize and evaluate ISAC systems and techniques, it is crucial to have an accurate and realistic wireless channel model. However, some important features of ISAC channels have not been well characterized, for example, most existing ISAC channel models consider communication channels and sensing channels independently, whereas ignoring correlation under the consistent environment. Moreover, sensing channels have not been well modeled in the existing standard-level channel models. Therefore, in order to better model ISAC channel, a cluster-based statistical channel model is proposed in this paper, which is based on measurements conducted at 28 GHz. In the proposed model, a new framework based on 3GPP standard is proposed, which includes communication clusters and sensing clusters. Clustering and tracking algorithms are used to extract and analyze ISAC channel characteristics. Furthermore, some special sensing cluster structures such as shared sensing cluster, newborn sensing cluster, etc., are defined to model correlation and difference between communication and sensing channels. Finally, accuracy of the proposed model is validated based on measurements and simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a potential technology of 6G, aiming to enable end-to-end information processing ability and native perception capability for future communication systems. As an important part of the ISAC application scenarios, ISAC aided vehicle-to-everything (V2X) can improve the traffic efficiency and safety through intercommunication and synchronous perception. It is necessary to carry out measurement, characterization, and modeling for vehicular ISAC channels as the basic theoretical support for system design. In this paper, dynamic vehicular ISAC channel measurements at 28 GHz are carried out and provide data for the characterization of non-stationarity characteristics. Based on the actual measurements, this paper analyzes the time-varying PDPs, RMSDS and non-stationarity characteristics of front, lower front, left and right perception directions in a complicated V2X scenarios. The research in this paper can enrich the investigation of vehicular ISAC channels and enable the analysis and design of vehicular ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>User Localization with HRIS and Backscatter Modulation for Next-Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid reflective intelligent surfaces (HRISs) can support localization in sixth-generation (6G) networks thanks to their ability to generate narrow beams and at the same time receive and process locally the impinging signals. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for user localization in a network with an HRIS. The protocol includes two steps. In the first step, the HRIS operates in full absorption mode and the user equipment (UE) transmits a signal that is locally processed at the HRIS to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA). In the second step, the base station transmits a downlink reference signal to the UE, and the HRIS superimposes a message by a backscatter modulation. The message contains information on the previously estimated AoA. Lastly, the UE, knowing the position of the HRIS, estimates the time of flight (ToF) from the signal of the second step and demodulates the information on the AoA to obtain an estimate of its location. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution, also in comparison with the Cram\'er Rao lower bound on the estimated quantities.nd on the estimated quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning enabled semantic communications have been developed to understand transmission content from semantic level, which realize effective and accurate information transfer. Aiming to the vision of sixth generation (6G) networks, wireless devices are expected to have native perception and intelligent capabilities, which associate wireless channel with surrounding environments from physical propagation dimension to semantic information dimension. Inspired by these, we aim to provide a new paradigm on wireless channel from semantic level. A channel semantic model and its characterization framework are proposed in this paper. Specifically, a channel semantic model composes of status semantics, behavior semantics and event semantics. Based on actual channel measurement at 28 GHz, as well as multi-mode data, example results of channel semantic characterization are provided and analyzed, which exhibits reasonable and interpretable semantic information.</description>

      <title>Channel Measurements and Modeling for Dynamic Vehicular ISAC Scenarios at 28 GHz</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technology for 6G, with the goal of providing end-to-end information processing and inherent perception capabilities for future communication systems. Within ISAC emerging application scenarios, vehicular ISAC technologies have the potential to enhance traffic efficiency and safety through integration of communication and synchronized perception abilities. To establish a foundational theoretical support for vehicular ISAC system design and standardization, it is necessary to conduct channel measurements, and modeling to obtain a deep understanding of the radio propagation. In this paper, a dynamic statistical channel model is proposed for vehicular ISAC scenarios, incorporating Sensing Multipath Components (S-MPCs) and Clutter Multipath Components (C-MPCs), which are identified by the proposed tracking algorithm. Based on actual vehicular ISAC channel measurements at 28 GHz, time-varying sensing characteristics in front, left, and right directions are investigated. To model the dynamic evolution process of channel, number of new S-MPCs, lifetimes, initial power and delay positions, dynamic variations within their lifetimes, clustering, power decay, and fading of C-MPCs are statistically characterized. Finally, the paper provides implementation of dynamic vehicular ISAC model and validates it by comparing key simulation statistics between measurements and simulations.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Invariant Music Indexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For music indexing robust to sound degradations and scalable for big music catalogs, this scientific report presents an approach based on audio descriptors relevant to the music content and invariant to sound transformations (noise addition, distortion, lossy coding, pitch/time transformations, or filtering e.g.). To achieve this task, one of the key point of the proposed method is the definition of high-dimensional audio prints, which are intrinsically (by design) robust to some sound degradations. The high dimensionality of this first representation is then used to learn a linear projection to a sub-space significantly smaller, which reduces again the sensibility to sound degradations using a series of discriminant analyses. Finally, anchoring the analysis times on local maxima of a selected onset function, an approximative hashing is done to provide a better tolerance to bit corruptions, and in the same time to make easier the scaling of the method.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming landscape of Earth Observation missions will defined by networked heterogeneous nanosatellite constellations required to meet strict mission requirements, such as revisit times and spatial resolution. However, scheduling satellite communications in these satellite networks through efficiently creating a global satellite Contact Plan (CP) is a complex task, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being limited by onboard computational resources. The paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by modeling the constellations and CP as dynamic networks and employing graph-based techniques. The proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural network to evaluate the performance of a given CP and update it using a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. The trained neural network can predict the network delay with a mean absolute error of 3.6 minutes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully design a contact plan for large satellite networks, improving the delay by 29.1%, similar to a traditional approach, while performing the objective evaluations 20x faster.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Resting-State fMRI Data in Marijuana Users via High-Order Attention Brain Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustained use of marijuana significantly impacts the lives and health of people. In this study, we propose an interpretable novel framework called the HOGAB (High-Order Attention Graph Attention Neural Networks) model to analyze local abnormal brain activity in chronic marijuana users in two datasets. The HOGAB integrates dynamic intrinsic functional networks with LSTM technology to capture temporal patterns in fMRI time series of marijuana users. Moreover, we use the high-order attention module in neighborhood nodes for information fusion and message passing, enhancing community clustering analysis for long-term marijuana users. Furthermore, we improve the overall learning ability of the model by incorporating attention mechanisms, achieving an AUC of 85.1% and an accuracy of 80.7% in multigraph classification. In addition, we compare linear machine learning methods and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed HODAB model. Specifically, we identified the most relevant subnetworks and cognitive regions that are negatively influenced by persistent marijuana use, revealing that chronic marijuana use adversely affects cognitive control, particularly within the Dorsal Attention and Frontoparietal networks, which are essential for attentional, cognitive, and higher cognitive functions. The results show that our proposed model is capable of accurately predicting craving maps and identifying brain maps associated with long-term cravings, and also pinpointing active areas that are important for analysis.</description>

      <title>On Target Detection by Quantum Radar (Preprint)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both Noise Radar and Quantum Radar, with some alleged common features, exploit the randomness of the transmitted signal to enhance radar covertness and to reduce mutual interference. While Noise Radar has been prototypically developed and successfully tested in many environments by different organizations, the significant investments on Quantum Radar seem not to be followed by practically operating prototypes or demonstrators. Starting from the trivial fact that radar detection depends on the energy transmitted on the target and backscattered by it, some detailed evaluations in this work show that the detection performance of all the proposed QR types in the literature are orders of magnitude below the ones of a much simpler and cheaper equivalent classica radar set, in particular of the NR type. Moreover, the absence of a, sometimes alleged, Quantum radar cross section different from the radar cross section is explained. Hence, the various Quantum Radar proposals cannot lead to any useful result, especially, but not limited to, the alleged detection of stealth targets.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Reciprocal MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of transmit precoder and receive combiner matrices to support $N_{\rm s}$ independent data streams over a time-division duplex (TDD) point-to-point massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with either a fully digital or a hybrid structure. The optimal precoder and combiner design amounts to finding the top-$N_{\rm s}$ singular vectors of the channel matrix, but the explicit estimation of the entire high-dimensional channel would require significant pilot overhead. Alternatively, prior works seek to find the precoding and combining matrices directly by exploiting channel reciprocity and by using the power iteration method, but its performance degrades in the low SNR regime. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper proposes a learning-based active sensing framework, where the transmitter and the receiver send pilots alternately using sensing beamformers that are actively designed as functions of previously received pilots. This is accomplished by using recurrent neural networks to summarize information from the historical observations into hidden state vectors, then using fully connected neural networks to learn the appropriate sensing beamformers in the next pilot stage and finally the transmit precoding and receive combiner matrices for data communications. Simulations demonstrate that the learning-based method outperforms existing approaches significantly and maintains superior performance even in low SNR regimes both in fully digital and hybrid MIMO scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Road to Next-Generation Multiple Access: A 50-Year Tutorial Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communications has been significantly influenced by remarkable advancements in multiple access (MA) technologies over the past five decades, shaping the landscape of modern connectivity. Within this context, a comprehensive tutorial review is presented, focusing on representative MA techniques developed over the past 50 years. The following areas are explored: i) The foundational principles and information-theoretic capacity limits of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are characterized, along with its extension to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA. ii) Several MA transmission schemes exploiting the spatial domain are investigated, encompassing both conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA)/MIMO-NOMA systems and near-field MA systems utilizing spherical-wave propagation models. iii) The application of NOMA to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems is studied. This includes an introduction to typical NOMA-based downlink/uplink ISAC frameworks, followed by an evaluation of their performance limits using a mutual information (MI)-based analytical framework. iv) Major issues and research opportunities associated with the integration of MA with other emerging technologies are identified to facilitate MA in next-generation networks, i.e., next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Throughout the paper, promising directions are highlighted to inspire future research endeavors in the realm of MA and NGMA.</description>

      <title>Universal Auto-encoder Framework for MIMO CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing auto-encoder (AE)-based channel state information (CSI) frameworks have focused on a specific configuration of user equipment (UE) and base station (BS), and thus the input and output sizes of the AE are fixed. However, in the real-world scenario, the input and output sizes may vary depending on the number of antennas of the BS and UE and the allocated resource block in the frequency dimension. A naive approach to support the different input and output sizes is to use multiple AE models, which is impractical for the UE due to the limited HW resources. In this paper, we propose a universal AE framework that can support different input sizes and multiple compression ratios. The proposed AE framework significantly reduces the HW complexity while providing comparable performance in terms of compression ratio-distortion trade-off compared to the naive and state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, a revolutionary communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering "listen more, transmit less" strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Impact of Inter-Operator Interference via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wireless communication system is studied that operates in the presence of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, a multi-operator environment is considered where each operator utilizes an RIS to enhance its communication quality. Although out-of-band interference does not exist (since each operator uses isolated spectrum resources), RISs controlled by different operators do affect the system performance of one another due to the inherently rapid phase shift adjustments that occur on an independent basis. The system performance of such a communication scenario is analytically studied for the practical case where discrete-only phase shifts occur at RIS. The proposed framework is quite general since it is valid under arbitrary channel fading conditions as well as the presence (or not) of the transceiver's direct link. Finally, the derived analytical results are verified via numerical and simulation trial as well as some novel and useful engineering outcomes are manifested.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Semantic Communication over Wireless Networks with Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of joint transmission and computation resource allocation for probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is investigated. In the considered model, the base station (BS) needs to transmit a large amount of data to multiple users with RSMA. Due to limited communication resources, the BS is required to utilize semantic communication techniques to compress the large-sized data. The semantic communication is enabled by shared probability graphs between the BS and the users. The probability graph can be used to further compress the transmission data at the BS, while the received compressed semantic information can be recovered through using the same shared probability graph at each user side. The semantic information compression progress consumes additional computation power at the BS, which inevitably decreases the transmission power due to limited total power budget. Considering both the effect of semantic compression ratio and computation power, the semantic rate expression for RSMA is first obtained. Then, based on the obtained rate expression, an optimization problem is formulated with the aim of maximizing the sum of semantic rates of all users under total power, semantic compression ratio, and rate allocation constraints. To tackle this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed, where the rate allocation and transmit beamforming design subproblem is solved using a successive convex approximation method, and the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed using a greedy algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problems of interference prediction and sensing for efficient spectrum access and link adaptation. The considered approach for interference prediction relies on a parametric model. However, we assume that the number of observations available to learn theses parameters is limited. This implies that they should be treated as random variables rather than fixed values. We show how this can impact the spectrum access and link adaptation strategies. We also introduce the notion of "interferer-coherence time" to establish the number of independent interferer state realizations experienced by a codeword. We explain how it can be computed taking into account the model uncertainty and how this impacts the link adaptation.</description>

      <title>AdaBoost-Based Efficient Channel Estimation and Data Detection in One-Bit Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has been considered as a viable alternative to high resolution counterparts in realizing and commercializing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the issue of discarding the amplitude information by one-bit quantizers has to be compensated. Thus, carefully tailored methods need to be developed for one-bit channel estimation and data detection as the conventional ones cannot be used. To address these issues, the problems of one-bit channel estimation and data detection for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system that operates over uncorrelated frequency selective channels are investigated here. We first develop channel estimators that exploit Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and approximated versions of it as the so-called weak classifiers in an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) approach. Particularly, the combination of the approximated GDA classifiers with AdaBoost offers the benefit of scalability with the linear order of computations, which is critical in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. We then take advantage of the same idea for proposing the data detectors. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed channel estimators and data detectors compared to other methods. They show comparable/better performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods, but require dramatically lower computational complexities and run times.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Network based Federated Learning for Multi-user Indoor Positioning Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the use of channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning is studied. In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36\%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data.</description>

      <title>Exploring Upper-6GHz and mmWave in Real-World 5G Networks: A Direct on-Field Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum crunch challenge poses a vital threat to the progress of cellular networks and recently prompted the inclusion of millimeter wave (mmWave) and Upper 6GHz (U6G) in the 3GPP standards. These two bands promise to unlock a large portion of untapped spectrum, but the harsh propagation due to the increased carrier frequency might negatively impact the performance of urban Radio Access Network (RAN) deployments. Within the span of a year, two co-located 5G networks operating in these frequency bands were deployed at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, entirely dedicated to the dense urban performance assessment of the two systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the measurement campaigns conducted on them, with the U6G campaign representing the first of its kind. A benchmark is provided by ray-tracing simulations. The results suggest that networks operating in these frequency bands provide good indoor and outdoor coverage and throughput in urban scenarios, even when deployed in the macro base station setup common to lower frequencies. In addition, a comparative performance analysis of these two key technologies is provided, offering insights on their relative strengths, weaknesses and improvement margins and informing on which bands is better suited for urban macro coverage.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users and Phase Misalignments: A Novel Partially Coherent Transmission Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. This work proposes a novel partially coherent (PC) transmission framework to cope with the challenge of phase misalignment among the access points (APs), which is important for unlocking the full potential of cell-free massive MIMO technology. With the PC operation, the APs are only required to be phase-aligned within clusters. Each cluster transmits the same data stream towards each user equipment (UE), while different clusters send different data streams. We first propose a novel algorithm to group APs into clusters such that the distance between two APs is always smaller than a reference distance ensuring the phase alignment of these APs. Then, we propose new algorithms that optimize the combining at UEs and precoding at APs to maximize the downlink sum data rates. We also propose a novel algorithm for data stream allocation to further improve the sum data rate of the PC operation. Numerical results show that the PC operation using the proposed framework with a sufficiently small reference distance can offer a sum rate close to the sum rate of the ideal fully coherent (FC) operation that requires network-wide phase alignment. This demonstrates the potential of PC operation in practical deployments of cell-free massive MIMO networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Auto-encoder for Time-offset Faster-than-Nyquist Downlink NOMA with Timing Errors and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine encoding and decoding of transmitted sequences for the downlink time-offset faster than Nyquist signaling non-orthogonal multiple access NOMA (T-NOMA) channel. We employ a previously proposed singular value decomposition (SVD)-based scheme as a benchmark. While this SVD scheme provides reliable communication, our findings reveal that it is not optimal in terms of bit error rate (BER). Additionally, the SVD is sensitive to timing offset errors, and its time complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) auto-encoder (AE) for encoding and decoding with linear time complexity. We explain the design of the encoder and decoder architectures and the training criteria. By examining several variants of the CNN AE, we show that it can achieve an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed CNN AE surpasses the SVD method by approximately 2 dB in a T-NOMA system with no timing offset errors or channel state information estimation errors. In the presence of channel state information (CSI) error variance of 1$\%$ and uniform timing error at $\pm$4\% of the symbol interval, the proposed CNN AE provides up to 10 dB SNR gain over the SVD method. We also propose a novel modified training objective function consisting of a linear combination of the traditionally used cross-entropy (CE) loss function and a closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) called the Q-loss function. Simulations show that the modified loss function achieves SNR gains of up to 1 dB over the CE loss function alone.</description>

      <title>Waveform Optimization and Beam Focusing for Near-field Wireless Power Transfer with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas and Non-linear Energy Harvesters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology for future wireless systems. However, the low power transfer efficiency (PTE) is a critical challenge for practical implementations. One of the main inefficiency sources is the power consumption and loss introduced by key components such as high-power amplifier (HPA) and rectenna, thus they must be carefully considered for PTE optimization. Herein, we consider a near-field RF-WPT system with the emerging dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) at the transmitter and non-linear energy harvesters. We provide a mathematical framework to calculate the power consumption and harvested power from multi-tone signal transmissions. Then, we propose an approach relying on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation for waveform optimization and beam focusing to minimize power consumption while meeting energy harvesting requirements. Numerical results show that increasing the transmit tones reduces the power consumption by leveraging the rectifier's non-linearity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that increasing the antenna length improves the performance, while both DMA and fully-digital architectures may be favorable depending on the setup. Finally, our results verify that the transmitter generates accurate energy beams pointed to devices located in the near-field, while energy beams are formed in devices' direction in the far-field region.</description>

      <title>Semantic-aware Sampling and Transmission in Energy Harvesting Systems: A POMDP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of real-time remote tracking of a partially observable Markov source in an energy harvesting system with an unreliable communication channel. We consider both sampling and transmission costs. Different from most prior studies that assume the source is fully observable, the sampling cost renders the source partially observable. The goal is to jointly optimize sampling and transmission policies for two semantic-aware metrics: i) a general distortion measure and ii) the age of incorrect information (AoII). We formulate a stochastic control problem. To solve the problem for each metric, we cast a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is transformed into a belief MDP. Then, for both AoII under the perfect channel setup and distortion, we express the belief as a function of the age of information (AoI). This expression enables us to effectively truncate the corresponding belief space and formulate a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm. For the AoII metric in the general setup, a deep reinforcement learning policy is proposed to solve the belief MDP problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policies and, in particular, reveal a non-monotonic switching-type structure of the real-time optimal policy with respect to AoI.</description>

      <title>Efficient Design for Multi-user Downlink Beamforming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers downlink multi-user transmission facilitated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). First, focusing on the multi-group multicast beamforming scenario, we develop a fast and scalable algorithm for the joint base station (BS) and RIS beamforming optimization to minimize the transmit power subject to the user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By exploring the structure of this QoS problem, we show that the joint beamforming optimization can be naturally decomposed into a BS multicast beamforming QoS problem and an RIS passive multicast beamforming max-min-fair (MMF) problem. We propose an alternating multicast beamforming (AMBF) algorithm to solve the two subproblems alternatingly. For the BS QoS subproblem, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure to obtain the BS beamformers efficiently. Furthermore, we reformulate the challenging RIS MMF subproblem and employ a first-order projected subgradient algorithm (PSA), which yields closed-form updates. The computational complexity of the AMBF algorithm grows linearly with the number of RIS elements and BS antennas. We further show that the AMBF approach is also an efficient method for the RIS-assisted downlink multi-user unicast beamforming problem, providing semi-closed-form updates. Next, we study the MMF problem for the RIS-assisted downlink beamforming design and propose a PSA-based fast algorithm to compute the BS and RIS beamforming solutions with closed-form updates per iteration, leading to a highly computationally efficient solution. Simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in both performance and computational cost compared to other alternative methods.</description>

      <title>KGAMC: A Novel Knowledge Graph Driven Automatic Modulation Classification Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a promising technology to realize intelligent wireless communications in the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks. Recently, many data-and-knowledge dual-driven AMC schemes have achieved high accuracy. However, most of these schemes focus on generating additional prior knowledge or features of blind signals, which consumes longer computation time and ignores the interpretability of the model learning process. To solve these problems, we propose a novel knowledge graph (KG) driven AMC (KGAMC) scheme by training the networks under the guidance of domain knowledge. A modulation knowledge graph (MKG) with the knowledge of modulation technical characteristics and application scenarios is constructed and a relation-graph convolution network (RGCN) is designed to extract knowledge of the MKG. This knowledge is utilized to facilitate the signal features separation of the data-oriented model by implementing a specialized feature aggregation method. Simulation results demonstrate that KGAMC achieves superior classification performance compared to other benchmark schemes, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Furthermore, the signal features of the high-order modulation are more discriminative, thus reducing the confusion between similar signals.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning Across Data Silos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring graph topology from smooth graph signals in a novel but practical scenario where data are located in distributed clients and prohibited from leaving local clients due to factors such as privacy concerns. The main difficulty in this task is how to exploit the potentially heterogeneous data of all clients under data silos. To this end, we first propose an auto-weighted multiple graph learning model to jointly learn a personalized graph for each local client and a single consensus graph for all clients. The personalized graphs match local data distributions, thereby mitigating data heterogeneity, while the consensus graph captures the global information. Moreover, the model can automatically assign appropriate contribution weights to local graphs based on their similarity to the consensus graph. We next devise a tailored algorithm to solve the induced problem, where all raw data are processed locally without leaving clients. Theoretically, we establish a provable estimation error bound and convergence analysis for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data are carried out, and the results illustrate that our approach can learn graphs effectively in the target scenario.</description>

      <title>Bures-Wasserstein Means of Graphs</title>

Abstract: Finding the mean of sampled data is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics. However, in cases where the data samples are graph objects, defining a mean is an inherently difficult task. We propose a novel framework for defining a graph mean via embeddings in the space of smooth graph signal distributions, where graph similarity can be measured using the Wasserstein metric. By finding a mean in this embedding space, we can recover a mean graph that preserves structural information. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the novel graph mean, and provide an iterative algorithm for computing it. To highlight the potential of our framework as a valuable tool for practical applications in machine learning, it is evaluated on various tasks, including k-means clustering of structured aligned graphs, classification of functional brain networks, and semi-supervised node classification in multi-layer graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent performance, outperforms existing baseline approaches, and improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Analysis: Taxonomy, Progress, and Prospects</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Big AI Models for 6G Wireless Networks: Opportunities, Challenges, and Research Directions</title>

Abstract: Recently, big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) represented by chatGPT have brought an incredible revolution. With the pre-trained BAIMs in certain fields, numerous downstream tasks can be accomplished with only few-shot or even zero-shot learning and exhibit state-of-the-art performances. As widely envisioned, the big AI models are to rapidly penetrate into major intelligent services and applications, and are able to run at low unit cost and high flexibility. In 6G wireless networks, to fully enable intelligent communication, sensing and computing, apart from providing other intelligent wireless services and applications, it is of vital importance to design and deploy certain wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs). However, there still lacks investigation on architecture design and system evaluation for wBAIM. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive discussion as well as some in-depth prospects on the demand, design and deployment aspects of the wBAIM. We opine that wBAIM will be a recipe of the 6G wireless networks to build high-efficient, sustainable, versatile, and extensible wireless intelligence for numerous promising visions. Then, we provide the core characteristics, principles, and pilot studies to guide the design of wBAIMs, and discuss the key aspects of developing wBAIMs through identifying the differences between the existing BAIMs and the emerging wBAIMs. Finally, related research directions and potential solutions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Wireless Ear EEG to Monitor Drowsiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06076</link>

Abstract: Wireless, neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness, cognitive, and health monitoring for heavy machinery operators, pilots, and drivers. While existing systems use in-cabin sensors to alert operators before accidents, wearables may enable monitoring across many user environments. Current neural wearables are promising but limited by consumable electrodes and bulky, wired electronics. To improve neural wearable usability, scalability, and enable discreet use in daily and itinerant environments, this work showcases an end-to-end system for the first wireless, in-ear, dry-electrode earpiece for monitoring drowsiness. The proposed platform integrates additive manufacturing processes for gold-plated dry electrodes, user-generic earpiece designs, wireless electronics, and low-complexity machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the platform, thirty-five hours of ExG data were recorded across nine subjects performing repetitive drowsiness-inducing tasks. The data was used to train three, offline classifier models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and evaluated with three training regimes (user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out). The support vector machine classifier achieved an average accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate for the first time that dry, 3D printed, user-generic electrodes can be used with wireless electronics to rapidly prototype wearable systems, which achieve comparable average accuracy (&gt;90%) to existing state-of-the-art in-ear and scalp ExG systems that utilize wet electrodes and wired, benchtop electronics. Further, this work demonstrates the feasibility of using population-trained machine learning models in future, wearable ear ExG applications focused on cognitive health and wellness tracking.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO: CSI Compression and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated high performance in compressing and reconstructing the channel state information (CSI) and reducing the CSI feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. One key challenge, however, with the DL approaches is the demand for extensive training data. Collecting this real-world CSI data incurs significant overhead that hinders the DL approaches from scaling to a large number of communication sites. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes site-specific \textit{digital twins} to aid the training of DL models. The proposed digital twin approach generates site-specific synthetic CSI data from the EM 3D model and ray tracing, which can then be used to train the DL model without real-world data collection. To further improve the performance, we adopt online data selection to refine the DL model training with a small real-world CSI dataset. Results show that a DL model trained solely on the digital twin data can achieve high performance when tested in a real-world deployment. Further, leveraging domain adaptation techniques, the proposed approach requires orders of magnitude less real-world data to approach the same performance of the model trained completely on a real-world CSI dataset.</description>
