      <title>Ultracold long-range van der Waals Rydberg trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg molecules, Rydberg-atom or Rydberg-molecule, are an essential ingredient of cold molecular sciences. However, due to the richness of Rydberg-neutral interactions, new kinds of Rydberg molecules and binding mechanisms are still to be discovered. In this work, we predict the existence of ultra-long-range van der Waals trimers in dilute atom-gas mixtures. These are bound states of a Rydberg atom and a diatomic polar molecule mediated by the long-range van der Waals interaction. This new binding mechanism gives rise to trimers with sizes between 5-500~nm and binding energies between 2 MHz and 0.2 kHz depending on the atomic principal quantum number $n$ and orbital angular momentum $L$. We show that these molecules can be produced via two-photon photoassociation, with rates on the order of (10$^{-13}$ - 10$^{-11}$) cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ for temperatures in the range of (0.5 $\mu K$ - 10$\mu K$), and discuss the feasibility of observing trimer resonances.</description>

      <title>Locally-sealed microfabricated vapor cells filled from an ex situ Cs source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfabricated alkali vapor cells are key to enable miniature devices such as atomic clocks and optically pumped magnetometers with reduced size, weight and power. Yet, more versatile fabrication methods are still needed to further expand their use cases. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to collectively fill and seal microfabricated cesium cells using locally-sealed microchannels patterned within one of the glass substrates comprising the cells. Unlike current methods that rely on wafer-level anodic bonding as the last sealing step, an approach based on local sealing opens the path to features so far limited to traditional glass-blown cells, including the ability to deposit temperature-sensitive antirelaxation coatings, reaching lower background gas pressure without an additional gettering material or filling with diverse atomic or molecular species.</description>

      <title>Triaxial Alignment Magnetometer Utilizing Free-Spin Precession in the Geomagnetic Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a triaxial alignment magnetometer based on free-spin precession deployed in the geomagnetic range. Existing vector measurement methods often require complex optical setups, heating structures, and laser modulation. This study addresses this challenge by employing a linearly polarized probe beam to induce atomic alignment and subsequently detecting the optical polarization rotation caused by the pulsed radio frequency field. The experiment is conducted in a paraffin-coated cell without buffer gas at room temperature, containing rubidium with natural abundance. We report triaxial measurements with a static magnetic field amplitude of approximately 50 $\mu{\text{T}}$ (close to Earth's magnetic field), where the noise levels for each axis are approximately 5.3 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$, 4.7 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$, and 9.3 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$ respectively. The proposed method demonstrates a simple structure suitable for cost-effective and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. Here, we present a new design based on virtual load, where a low-frequency coil with a frequency of up to 30\,MHz, functions as both an inductor and a power-sharing element in a capacitive transformer circuit. This design enables a highly efficient RF circuit with tunable matching bandwidth. It integrates broadband and narrowband coils into a compact configuration, overcoming the distance limitations of metallic chambers. The broadband RF system, tested in a 10-second evaporative cooling experiment, reduced input power from 14.7\,dBW to -3.5\,dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10\,$\mu$K. The narrowband RF system was tested in a Landau-Zener experiment and transferred 80\,\% of Rb atoms from |F=2, m_F=2&gt; to |2, -2&gt; in 1 second, yielding a Rabi frequency of 7.6\,kHz at 0.1\,dBW. The power-sharing properties of the virtual load ensure impedance closely matches the ideal lumped-element simulations, demonstrating the design's robustness to disturbances.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Magnetic-Field-Induced Shift in Quantum Frequency Standards Based on Coherent Population Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field-induced frequency shift (MFS) of the clock "0-0" transition in the microwave quantum frequency standard (atomic clock) based on coherent population trapping (CPT) in $^{87}$Rb vapor. To scan the CPT resonance and to form the error signal, a method analogous to the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique in the optical frequency range is employed, where the modulating frequency ($f_m$) significantly exceeds the resonance linewidth (FWHM). The experiments demonstrate that this technique offers brilliant capabilities for controlling the sensitivity of the clock transition frequency to magnetic field variations in the vapor cell compared to the conventional method with low-frequency modulation ($f_m$$\,\ll\,$FWHM). Specifically, the PDH technique provides several optimal values of the bias magnetic field generated by the solenoid, at which the "0-0" transition frequency exhibits extremely low sensitivity to small variations in the external magnetic field. Furthermore, these magnetic field values can be easily adjusted by changing $f_m$, which is relevant for optimization of the atomic clock's operating regime. The experimental results show that by using the PDH technique, the influence of MFS on the clock transition can be suppressed down to $\approx\,$$3.2$$\,\times\,$$10^{-13}$$\delta B^2$ mG$^{-2}$. These findings can be leveraged both to relax stringent requirements for magnetic field shielding in state-of-the-art CPT-based miniature atomic clocks (MACs) and to build a new generation of such clocks with long-term frequency stability better than $10^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>Resonance nuclear excitation of the $^{229}$Th nucleus via electronic bridge process in Th~II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 8.4 eV transition in the $^{229}$Th nucleus is the basis for a high-precision nuclear clock with exceptional sensitivity to new physics effects. We have identified several cases in the Th$^+$ ion where electronic excitations closely resonate with the nuclear excitation, with the smallest energy difference being $\Delta = -0.09$ cm$^{-1}$. We investigate the electronic bridge process, in which nuclear excitation is induced via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper selection of laser frequencies can lead to a dramatic enhancement of this effect. Additionally, we show that the interaction with electrons significantly shortens the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using GHz repetition rate pulses in burst mode has demonstrated numerous advantages for highly efficient material removal. In this work, we present high-speed (over 100 kHz) micro-laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (micro-LIBS) with ultra-low pulse energies in the range of 10-200 nJ using our recently developed 2.8 GHz burst-mode Yb-doped fiber laser. We delivered 40 ps-long pulses to the sample with a beam diameter of about 18 microns. A systematic LIBS study was conducted on stainless steel (SS) at different burst durations and burst energies to study their effects on the optical emission spectrum. Finally, the electron temperature and electron density were determined using the Boltzmann plot method and Stark-broadened line profile analysis, respectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding Magnesium Dissolution through Machine Learn-ing Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnesium alloys have become increasingly important for various potential industrial applications, especially in energy storage, due to their outstanding properties. However, a clear under-standing of the dissolution mechanism of magnesium in the most common aqueous environments re-mains a critical challenge, hindering the broader application of magnesium alloys. To address pending key controversies in magnesium alloys research, the atomic-scale hydrogen evolution process and dis-solution mechanism of magnesium were investigated by combining machine learning molecular dy-namics with density functional theory. These controversies include the presence of magnesium reaction intermediates, the formation of uni-positive Mg+, the specific reaction steps involved in hydrogen evo-lution and magnesium dissolution, and the generation and growth mechanisms of the surface films. The results indicate that the intermediate species in the magnesium dissolution process is solid-phase MgOH, which exhibits an MgO-like structure. The magnesium in MgOH is identified as the widely recognized uni-positive Mg+. The intermediate film is formed, consisting primarily of the MgOH phase with a small amount of MgO. This film grows inward by extending into the magnesium substrate. Un-der sufficient water availability, the film undergoes further oxidation to form Mg(OH)2. These findings highlight the critical role of the MgOH phase in the magnesium dissolution process, leading to the pro-posal of a dissolution model based on MgOH/MgO solid phases as intermediates. These insights deep-en the understanding of magnesium dissolution, pave the way for the development of more effective anti-corrosion strategies for magnesium alloys, and may also advance the utilization of magnesium in energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Directional Transport in Rydberg Atom Arrays via Kinetic Constraints and Temporal Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve directional transport of Rydberg excitations and entangled states in atomic arrays with unequal spacings. By leveraging distance-dependent Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and temporally modulated laser detunings, our method directs excitation flow without requiring local addressing. Numerical simulations demonstrate robust and coherent transport under experimentally realistic conditions. Additionally, we show that this scheme enables controlled transport of Bell pairs and preserves entanglement during propagation. The approach provides a versatile platform for programmable directional transport, with potential applications in quantum simulation, entanglement distribution, and the design of scalable quantum processors and networks.</description>

      <title>Multiband dispersion and warped vortices of strongly-interacting photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum correlations between interacting photons realized through co-propagating Rydberg polaritons. We show that the evolution of the $n$-photon wavefunction is governed by a multiband dispersion featuring one massive mode and $n-1$ degenerate modes, such as two Dirac cones for $n=3$. The band structure exhibits an $n$-fold rotational symmetry, including an $n$-fold warped light cone, in contrast to the single-band, parabolic approximation often assumed for interacting polaritons. For three photons, the dispersion breaks the symmetry between a photon pair propagating ahead versus behind a single photon. We confirm these findings experimentally by measuring the three-photon phase and intensity correlation functions, revealing trigonal warping of the quantum vortex-ring generated by the three-photon interactions. Our analytical results are supported by rigorous numerical modeling that fully accounts for the photon propagation before, inside, and after the finite atomic medium. These findings advance the understanding of multi-photon interactions and the development of future multi-photon control tools.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron-star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements. Based on simple estimates, we also show that constraints on the distribution of tungsten in the ejecta may be accessible through the line shape, which may also yield information on the neutron-star merger remnant evolution.</description>

      <title>Cold source of atomic hydrogen for loading large magnetic traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a design and performance tests of an intense source of cold hydrogen atoms for loading large magnetic traps. Our source is based on a cryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of thermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a superfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding stages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of 7$\cdot$$10^{13}$ H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have successfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap recently built in our laboratory [arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2), 023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat allow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap. We have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the trap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic barrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as at the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in contact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In the latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the low-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ can be stored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision spectroscopy of cold H gas.</description>

      <title>Practicality of training a quantum-classical machine in the NISQ era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in classical computing have significantly enhanced machine learning applications, yet inherent limitations persist in terms of energy, resource and speed. Quantum machine learning algorithms offer a promising avenue to overcome these limitations but poses its own hurdles. This experimental study explores the limits of training a real experimental quantum classical hybrid system using supervised training protocols, on an ion trap platform. Challenges associated with ion trap-coupled classical processors are addressed, highlighting the $robustness$ of the genetic algorithm as a classical optimizer in navigating the noisy channels of NISQ-devices and the complex optimization landscape inherent in binary classification problems with many local minima. We intricately discuss why gradient-based optimizers may not be suitable in the NISQ era through a thorough analysis. These findings contribute insights into the performance of quantum-classical hybrid systems, emphasizing the significance of efficient training strategies and hardware considerations for practical quantum machine learning applications. This work not only advances the understanding of hybrid quantum-classical systems but also underscores the potential impact on real-world challenges through the convergence of quantum and classical computing paradigms operating without the aid of classical simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion mediated pairing in the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida to Efimov transition regime</title>

Abstract: The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction and Efimov physics are two distinct quantum phenomena in condensed matter and nuclear physics, respectively. The RKKY interaction describes correlations between impurities mediated by an electron gas, while Efimov physics describes universal bound states of three particles with resonant interactions. Recently, both effects have been observed in Bose-Fermi mixtures in the weak and resonant interaction regimes, respectively. Intriguing conjectures exist to elucidate how the two phenomena meet in the transition regime where the mixture is strongly interacting. In this work, we explore the RKKY-Efimov transition in a mixture of bosonic Cs-133 and fermionic Li-6 near a tunable interspecies Feshbach resonance. From dispersion and relaxation measurements, we find that the transition is highlighted by a fermion-mediated scattering resonance between Cs atoms and a weaker resonance on Li atoms. These resonances represent reactive scattering of Cs and Li atoms in the many-body regime, which reduces to an Efimov resonance in the thermal gas regime. Our observation demonstrates the intriguing interplay of two-, three-, and many-body physics in an Bose-Fermi mixture that connects condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and quantum many-body chemistry.</description>
