      <title>Forbidden Patterns in Mixed Linear Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph with a total order over its vertices. A linear layout of an ordered graph is a partition of the edges into sets of either non-crossing edges, called stacks, or non-nesting edges, called queues. The stack (queue) number of an ordered graph is the minimum number of required stacks (queues). Mixed linear layouts combine these layouts by allowing each set of edges to form either a stack or a queue. The minimum number of stacks plus queues is called the mixed page number. It is well known that ordered graphs with small stack number are characterized, up to a function, by the absence of large twists (that is, pairwise crossing edges). Similarly, ordered graphs with small queue number are characterized by the absence of large rainbows (that is, pairwise nesting edges). However, no such characterization via forbidden patterns is known for mixed linear layouts.
  We address this gap by introducing patterns similar to twists and rainbows, which we call thick patterns; such patterns allow a characterization, again up to a function, of mixed linear layouts of bounded-degree graphs. That is, we show that a family of ordered graphs with bounded maximum degree has bounded mixed page number if and only if the size of the largest thick pattern is bounded. In addition, we investigate an exact characterization of ordered graphs whose mixed page number equals a fixed integer $ k $ via a finite set of forbidden patterns. We show that for every $ k \ge 2 $, there is no such characterization, which supports the nature of our first result.</description>

      <title>Robust Deterministic Policies for Markov Decision Processes under Budgeted Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the computation of robust deterministic policies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in the Lightning Does Not Strike Twice (LDST) model of Mannor, Mebel and Xu (ICML '12). In this model, designed to provide robustness in the face of uncertain input data while not being overly conservative, transition probabilities and rewards are uncertain and the uncertainty set is constrained by a budget that limits the number of states whose parameters can deviate from their nominal values.
  Mannor et al. (ICML '12) showed that optimal randomized policies for MDPs in the LDST regime can be efficiently computed when only the rewards are affected by uncertainty. In contrast to these findings, we observe that the computation of optimal deterministic policies is $N\!P$-hard even when only a single terminal reward may deviate from its nominal value and the MDP consists of $2$ time periods. For this hard special case, we then derive a constant-factor approximation algorithm by combining two relaxations based on the Knapsack Cover and Generalized Assignment problem, respectively. For the general problem with possibly a large number of deviations and a longer time horizon, we derive strong inapproximability results for computing robust deterministic policies as well as $\Sigma_2^p$-hardness, indicating that the general problem does not even admit a compact mixed integer programming formulation.</description>

      <title>Time-Biased Random Walks and Robustness of Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks on expanders play a crucial role in Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, derandomization, graph theory, and distributed computing. A desirable property is that they are rapidly mixing, which is equivalent to having a spectral gap $\gamma$ (asymptotically) bounded away from $0$. Our work has two main strands.
  First, we establish a dichotomy for the robustness of mixing times on edge-weighted $d$-regular graphs (i.e., reversible Markov chains) subject to a Lipschitz condition, which bounds the ratio of adjacent weights by $\beta \geq 1$. If $\beta \ge 1$ is sufficiently small, then $\gamma \asymp 1$ and the mixing time is logarithmic in $n$. On the other hand, if $\beta \geq 2d$, there is an edge-weighting such that $\gamma$ is polynomially small in $1/n$.
  Second, we apply our robustness result to a time-dependent version of the so-called $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, as introduced in Azar et al. [Combinatorica 1996]. We show that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a bias strategy can be chosen adaptively so that the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk covers any bounded-degree regular expander in $\Theta(n)$ expected time, improving the previous-best bound of $O(n \log \log n)$. We prove the first non-trivial lower bound on the cover time of the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, showing that, on bounded-degree regular expanders, it is $\omega(n)$ whenever $\varepsilon = o(1)$. We establish this by controlling how much the probability of arbitrary events can be ``boosted'' by using a time-dependent bias strategy.</description>

      <title>Makespan Trade-offs for Visiting Triangle Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a primitive vehicle routing-type problem in which a fleet of $n$unit speed robots start from a point within a non-obtuse triangle $\Delta$, where $n \in \{1,2,3\}$. The goal is to design robots' trajectories so as to visit all edges of the triangle with the smallest visitation time makespan. We begin our study by introducing a framework for subdividing $\Delta$into regions with respect to the type of optimal trajectory that each point $P$ admits, pertaining to the order that edges are visited and to how the cost of the minimum makespan $R_n(P)$ is determined, for $n\in \{1,2,3\}$. These subdivisions are the starting points for our main result, which is to study makespan trade-offs with respect to the size of the fleet. In particular, we define $ R_{n,m} (\Delta)= \max_{P \in \Delta} R_n(P)/R_m(P)$, and we prove that, over all non-obtuse triangles $\Delta$: (i) $R_{1,3}(\Delta)$ ranges from $\sqrt{10}$ to $4$, (ii) $R_{2,3}(\Delta)$ ranges from $\sqrt{2}$ to $2$, and (iii) $R_{1,2}(\Delta)$ ranges from $5/2$ to $3$. In every case, we pinpoint the starting points within every triangle $\Delta$ that maximize $R_{n,m} (\Delta)$, as well as we identify the triangles that determine all $\inf_\Delta R_{n,m}(\Delta)$ and $\sup_\Delta R_{n,m}(\Delta)$ over the set of non-obtuse triangles.</description>

      <title>Maximum rectilinear convex subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We consider a variation of the classical Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres problem, presenting efficient algorithms with $O(n^3)$ running time and $O(n^2)$ space complexity that compute: (1) A subset $S$ of $P$ such that the boundary of the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has the maximum number of points from $P$, (2) a subset $S$ of $P$ such that the boundary of the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has the maximum number of points from $P$ and its interior contains no element of $P$, (3) a subset $S$ of $P$ such that the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has maximum area and its interior contains no element of $P$, and (4) when each point of $P$ is assigned a weight, positive or negative, a subset $S$ of $P$ that maximizes the total weight of the points in the rectilinear convex hull of $S$.
  We also revisit the problems of computing a maximum-area orthoconvex polygon and computing a maximum-area staircase polygon, amidst a point set in a rectangular domain. We obtain new and simpler algorithms to solve both problems with the same complexity as in the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Lyndon pairs and the lexicographically greatest perfect necklace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a finite alphabet. A necklace is a circular word. For positive integers $n$ and~$k$, a necklace is $(n,k)$-perfect if all words of length $n$ occur $k$ times but at positions with different congruence modulo $k$, for any convention of the starting position. We define the notion of a Lyndon pair and we use it to construct the lexicographically greatest $(n,k)$-perfect necklace, for any $n$ and $k$ such that $n$ divides~$k$ or $k$ divides~$n$. Our construction generalizes Fredricksen and Maiorana's construction of the lexicographically greatest de Bruijn sequence of order $n$, based on the concatenation of the Lyndon words whose length divide $n$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>
