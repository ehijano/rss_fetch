      <title>Simulating Evolvability as a Learning Algorithm: Empirical Investigations on Distribution Sensitivity, Robustness, and Constraint Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of evolvability, introduced by Valiant (2009), formalizes evolution as a constrained learning algorithm operating without labeled examples or structural knowledge. While theoretical work has established the evolvability of specific function classes under idealized conditions, the framework remains largely untested empirically. In this paper, we implement a genetic algorithm that faithfully simulates Valiant's model and conduct extensive experiments across six Boolean function classes: monotone conjunctions, monotone disjunctions, parity, majority, general conjunctions, and general disjunctions. Our study examines evolvability under uniform and non-uniform distributions, investigates the effects of fixed initial hypotheses and the removal of neutral mutations, and highlights how these constraints alter convergence behavior. We validate known results (e.g., evolvability of monotone conjunctions, non-evolvability of parity) and offer the first empirical evidence on the evolvability of majority and general Boolean classes. Our findings reveal sharp performance drops at intermediate dimensions and expose the essential role of neutral mutations in escaping fitness plateaus. We also demonstrate that evolvability can depend strongly on the input distribution. These insights clarify practical limits of evolutionary search and suggest new directions for theoretical work, including potential refinements to evolvability definitions and bounds. Our implementation provides a rigorous, extensible framework for empirical analysis and serves as a testbed for future explorations of learning through evolution.</description>

      <title>Edge-coloring problems with forbidden patterns and planted colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-coloring problems with forbidden patterns refer to decision problems whose input is a graph $\mathbb G$ and where the goal is to determine whether the edges of $\mathbb G$ can be colored (with a fixed finite set of colors) in a way that in the resulting colored graph $(\mathbb G, \xi)$, none of a fixed set of edge-colored obstructions admits a homomorphism to $(\mathbb G, \xi)$. In the coloring extension setting, some of the edges of $\mathbb G$ are already colored and the goal is to find an extension of this coloring omitting the obstructions. We show that for certain sets of obstructions, there is a polynomial-time equivalence between the coloring problem and the extension problem. We also show that for natural sets of obstructions, such coloring problems exhibit a P vs. NP-complete complexity dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Downward self-reducibility in the total function polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A problem $\mathcal{P}$ is considered downward self-reducible, if there exists an efficient algorithm for $\mathcal{P}$ that is allowed to make queries to only strictly smaller instances of $\mathcal{P}$. Downward self-reducibility has been well studied in the case of decision problems, and it is well known that any downward self-reducible problem must lie in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. Harsha, Mitropolsky and Rosen [ITCS, 2023] initiated the study of downward self reductions in the case of search problems. They showed the following interesting collapse: if a problem is in $\mathsf{TFNP}$ and also downward self-reducible, then it must be in $\mathsf{PLS}$. Moreover, if the problem admits a unique solution then it must be in $\mathsf{UEOPL}$.
  We demonstrate that this represents just the tip of a much more general phenomenon, which holds for even harder search problems that lie higher up in the total function polynomial hierarchy ($\mathsf{TF\Sigma_i^P}$). In fact, even if we allow our downward self-reduction to be much more powerful, such a collapse will still occur.
  We show that any problem in $\mathsf{TF\Sigma_i^P}$ which admits a randomized downward self-reduction with access to a $\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}$ oracle must be in $\mathsf{PLS}^{\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}}$. If the problem has \textit{essentially unique solutions} then it lies in $\mathsf{UEOPL}^{\mathsf{\Sigma_{i-1}^P}}$.
  As one (out of many) application of our framework, we get new upper bounds for the problems $\mathrm{Range Avoidance}$ and $\mathrm{Linear Ordering Principle}$ and show that they are both in $\mathsf{UEOPL}^{\mathsf{NP}}$.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Pseudorandomness against Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computational pseudorandomness has emerged as a fundamental notion that spans connections to complexity theory, cryptography and fundamental physics. However, all known constructions of efficient quantum-secure pseudorandom objects rely on complexity theoretic assumptions.
  In this work, we establish the first unconditionally secure efficient pseudorandom constructions against shallow-depth quantum circuit classes. We prove that:
  $\bullet$ Any quantum state 2-design yields unconditional pseudorandomness against both $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with arbitrarily many ancillae and $\mathsf{AC}^0\circ\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with nearly linear ancillae.
  $\bullet$ Random phased subspace states, where the phases are picked using a 4-wise independent function, are unconditionally pseudoentangled against the above circuit classes.
  $\bullet$ Any unitary 2-design yields unconditionally secure parallel-query pseudorandom unitaries against geometrically local $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ adversaries, even with limited $\mathsf{AC}^0$ postprocessing.
  Our indistinguishability results for 2-designs stand in stark contrast to the standard setting of quantum pseudorandomness against $\mathsf{BQP}$ circuits, wherein they can be distinguishable from Haar random ensembles using more than two copies or queries. Our work demonstrates that quantum computational pseudorandomness can be achieved unconditionally for natural classes of restricted adversaries, opening new directions in quantum complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Deadline-Aware Joint Task Scheduling and Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for stringent interactive quality-of-service has intensified in both mobile edge computing (MEC) and cloud systems, driven by the imperative to improve user experiences. As a result, the processing of computation-intensive tasks in these systems necessitates adherence to specific deadlines or achieving extremely low latency. To optimize task scheduling performance, existing research has mainly focused on reducing the number of late jobs whose deadlines are not met. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies in the total search time and scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present the optimal job scheduling algorithm designed to determine the optimal task order for a given set of tasks. In addition, users are enabled to make informed decisions for offloading tasks based on the information provided by servers. The details of performance analysis are provided to show its optimality and low complexity with the linearithmic time O(nlogn), where $n$ is the number of tasks. To tackle the uncertainty of the randomly arriving tasks, we further develop an online approach with fast outage detection that achieves rapid acceptance times with time complexity of O(n). Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the service ratio and scheduling cost.</description>

      <title>String Consensus Problems with Swaps and Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String consensus problems aim at finding a string that minimizes some given distance with respect to an input set of strings. In particular, in the \textsc{Closest String} problem, we are given a set of strings of equal length and a radius $d$. The objective is to find a new string that differs from each input string by at most $d$ substitutions. We study a generalization of this problem where, in addition to substitutions, swaps of adjacent characters are also permitted, each operation incurring a unit cost. Amir et al. showed that this generalized problem is NP-hard, even when only swaps are allowed. In this paper, we show that it is FPT with respect to the parameter $d$. Moreover, we investigate a variant in which the goal is to minimize the sum of distances from the output string to all input strings. For this version, we present a polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Invariance Principle for the Multi-slice, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an alphabet size $m\in\mathbb{N}$ thought of as a constant, and $\vec{k} = (k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ whose entries sum of up $n$, the $\vec{k}$-multi-slice is the set of vectors $x\in [m]^n$ in which each symbol $i\in [m]$ appears precisely $k_i$ times. We show an invariance principle for low-degree functions over the multi-slice, to functions over the product space $([m]^n,\mu^n)$ in which $\mu(i) = k_i/n$. This answers a question raised by Filmus et al.
  As applications of the invariance principle, we show:
  1. An analogue of the "dictatorship test implies computational hardness" paradigm for problems with perfect completeness, for a certain class of dictatorship tests. Our computational hardness is proved assuming a recent strengthening of the Unique-Games Conjecture, called the Rich $2$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture. Using this analogue, we show that assuming the Rich $2$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture, (a) there is an $r$-ary CSP $\mathcal{P}_r$ for which it is NP-hard to distinguish satisfiable instances of the CSP and instances that are at most $\frac{2r+1}{2^r} + o(1)$ satisfiable, and (b) hardness of distinguishing $3$-colorable graphs, and graphs that do not contain an independent set of size $o(1)$.
  2. A reduction of the problem of studying expectations of products of functions on the multi-slice to studying expectations of products of functions on correlated, product spaces. In particular, we are able to deduce analogues of the Gaussian bounds from \cite{MosselGaussian} for the multi-slice.
  3. In a companion paper, we show further applications of our invariance principle in extremal combinatorics, and more specifically to proving removal lemmas of a wide family of hypergraphs $H$ called $\zeta$-forests, which is a natural extension of the well-studied case of matchings.</description>

      <title>Certificate-Sensitive Subset Sum: Realizing Instance Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first deterministic, certificate-sensitive algorithm for a canonical NP-complete problem whose runtime provably adapts to the structure of each input. For a Subset-Sum instance $(S, t)$, let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of distinct subset sums and define $U = |\Sigma(S)|$. This set serves as an information-theoretically minimal witness, the instance-complexity (IC) certificate.
  Our solver, IC-SubsetSum, enumerates every element of $\Sigma(S)$ in deterministic time $O(U \cdot n^2)$ and space $O(U \cdot n)$. A randomized variant achieves expected runtime $O(U \cdot n)$. The algorithm's complexity is thus directly governed by the certificate size, and this structure-sensitive performance is paired with a guaranteed worst-case runtime of $O^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the first such result to strictly outperform classical methods on every instance.
  We revisit fine-grained reductions that rely on the classical $2^{n/2}$ hardness of SubsetSum and show that these arguments hold only for collision-free instances where $U$ is maximal. IC-SubsetSum reframes this barrier structurally and introduces a new paradigm for certificate-sensitive algorithms across NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Bimatrix Games with Common Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric bimatrix games that also have the common-payoff property, i.e., the two players receive the same payoff at any outcome of the game. Due to the symmetry property, these games are guaranteed to have symmetric Nash equilibria, where the two players play the same (mixed) strategy. While the problem of computing such symmetric equilibria in general symmetric bimatrix games is known to be intractable, namely PPAD-complete, this result does not extend to our setting. Indeed, due to the common-payoff property, the problem lies in the lower class CLS, ruling out PPAD-hardness. In this paper, we show that the problem remains intractable, namely it is CLS-complete. On the way to proving this result, as our main technical contribution, we show that computing a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a quadratic program remains CLS-hard, even when the feasible domain is a simplex.</description>
