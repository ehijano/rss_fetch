      <title>Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</description>

      <title>Topological gap solitons in equidistant lithium niobate waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equidistant 1D arrays of thin film lithium niobate waveguides can exhibit non-trivial topology due to a specific interplay between inter- and intra-modal couplings of two families of guided modes. In this work we analyze two-colour spatial solitons, emerging due to $\chi_2$ nonlinear interactions between the modes of non-trivial topology in the fundamental harmonic field, and modes of trivial topology in the second harmonic field. We discuss solitons localized in the bulk of the array (bulk solitons), and at an edge of a finite-size array (edge solitons). The latter emerge due to the nonlinear interactions between a topological edge mode in the fundamental harmonic and bulk modes in the second harmonic. We reveal that for each type of soliton, bulk or edge, there generally exist two families of solutions with different internal structures and ranges of propagation constants. All bulk solitons can only be excited above a certain power threshold dictated by the coupling strength in the second harmonic field and the phase matching between the fundamental and second harmonics. The power threshold for edge solitons generally appears to be much lower, and, by tuning the phase matching, it can be reduced to zero.</description>
