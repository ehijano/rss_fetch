      <title>The exact subgraph hierarchy and its local variant for the stable set problem for Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability number of a graph, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices, is NP-hard to compute. The exact subgraph hierarchy (ESH) provides a sequence of increasingly tighter upper bounds on the stability number, starting with the Lov\'asz theta function at the first level and including all exact subgraph constraints of subgraphs of order $k$ into the semidefinite program to compute the Lov\'asz theta function at level $k$.
  In this paper, we investigate the ESH for Paley graphs, a class of strongly regular, vertex-transitive graphs. We show that for Paley graphs, the bounds obtained from the ESH remain the Lov\'asz theta function up to a certain threshold level, i.e., the bounds of the ESH do not improve up to a certain level.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce the local ESH for the stable set problem for vertex-transitive graphs such as Paley graphs. We prove that this new hierarchy provides upper bounds on the stability number of vertex-transitive graphs that are at least as tight as those obtained from the ESH. Additionally, our computational experiments reveal that the local ESH produces superior bounds compared to the ESH for Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>Logic-Constrained Shortest Paths for Flight Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Logic-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (LCSP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSP.
  The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&amp;B algorithm.
  In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the Flight Planning Problem with TFRs as an LCSP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.</description>

      <title>Stable Approximation Algorithms for Dominating Set and Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dominating set problem and Independent Set Problem for dynamic graphs in the vertex-arrival model. We say that a dynamic algorithm for one of these problems is $k$-stable when it makes at most $k$ changes to its output independent set or dominating set upon the arrival of each vertex. We study trade-offs between the stability parameter $k$ of the algorithm and the approximation ratio it achieves. We obtain the following results. 1. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm the for Dominating set problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 4. 2. We present algorithms with very small stability parameters for the Dominating set problem in the setting where the arrival degree of each vertex is upper bounded by $d$. In particular, we give a $1$-stable $(d+1)^2$-approximation algorithm, a $3$-stable $(9d/2)$-approximation algorithm, and an $O(d)$-stable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm. 3. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree $3$. 4. Finally, we present a $2$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem, in the setting where the average degree of the graph is upper bounded by some constant $d$ at all times. We extend this latter algorithm to the fully dynamic model where vertices can also be deleted, achieving a $6$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Restricted subgraphs of edge-colored graphs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A properly edge-colored graph is a graph with a coloring of its edges such that no vertex is incident to two or more edges of the same color. A subgraph is called rainbow if all its edges have different colors. The problem of finding rainbow subgraphs or other restricted structures in edge-colored graphs has a long history, dating back to Euler's work on Latin squares. It has also proven to be a powerful method for studying several well-known questions in other areas.
  In this survey, we will provide a brief introduction to this topic, discuss several results in this area, and demonstrate their applications to problems in graph decomposition, additive combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and coding theory.</description>

      <title>Automated Inference of Graph Transformation Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosion of data available in life sciences is fueling an increasing demand for expressive models and computational methods. Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method.
  The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a "snapshot" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics.
  The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation.</description>

      <title>The damage number of the Cartesian product of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a variation of Cops and Robber, introduced in [D. Cox and A. Sanaei, The damage number of a graph, [Aust. J. of Comb. 75(1) (2019) 1-16] where vertices visited by a robber are considered damaged and a single cop aims to minimize the number of distinct vertices damaged by a robber. Motivated by the interesting relationships that often emerge between input graphs and their Cartesian product, we study the damage number of the Cartesian product of graphs. We provide a general upper bound and consider the damage number of the product of two trees or cycles. We also consider graphs with small damage number.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>An Enumerative Perspective on Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectivity (or equivalently, unweighted maximum flow) is an important measure in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and $t$, the connectivity $\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.
  Much research has gone into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau, and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\omega \in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the related problem of computing "small connectivities," it was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\min(k,\lambda(s,t))$ for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023].
  In this paper, we present an alternate exposition of these $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ and $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time algorithms, with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing an elegant but ad hoc "flow vector framework" for showing correctness of these algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero. This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms.</description>

      <title>Discrete Quantum Walks with Marked Vertices and Their Average Vertex Mixing Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete quantum walk on a regular graph $X$ that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices $S$ and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix $\AMM$.
  We then find bounds for entries in $\AMM$, and study when these bounds are tight. In particular, the average probabilities between marked vertices are lower bounded by a matrix determined by the induced subgraph $X[S]$, the vertex-deleted subgraph $X\backslash S$, and the edge deleted subgraph $X-E(S)$. We show this bound is achieved if and only if the marked vertices have walk-equitable neighborhoods in the vertex-deleted subgraph. Finally, for quantum walks attaining this bound, we determine when $\AMM[S,S]$ is symmetric, positive semidefinite or uniform.</description>
