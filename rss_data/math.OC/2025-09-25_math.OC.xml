      <title>Hierarchical null controllability of a degenerate parabolic equation with nonlocal coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Stackelberg-Nash strategy to show the local null controllability of a parabolic equation where the diffusion coefficient is the product of a degenerate function in space and a nonlocal term. We consider one control called \textit{leader} and two controls called \textit{followers}. To each leader we associate a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem; then, we find a leader that solves the null controllability problem. The linearized degenerated system is treated adapting Carleman estimates for degenerated systems from Demarque, L\'imaco and Viana \cite{DemarqueLimacoViana_deg_sys2020} and the local controllability of the non-linear system is obtained using Liusternik's inverse function theorem. The nonlocal coefficient originates a multiplicative coupling in the optimality system that gives rise to interesting calculations in the applications of the inverse function theorem.</description>

      <title>Autonomous driving using an optimized neural network based adaptive LPV-MPC controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driverless vehicles are complex systems operating in constantly changing environments. Automated driving is achieved by controlling the coupled longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. Model predictive control is one of the most promising tools for this type of application due to its optimal performance and ability to handle constraints. This paper addresses autonomous driving with an adaptive linear parameter varying model predictive controller (LPV-MPC), which is adapted by a neural network and optimized by an improved Genetic Algorithm. The proposed controller is evaluated on a challenging track under variable wind disturbance. Code can be found here: https://github.com/yassinekebbati/GA-optimized-MLP-based-LPV_MPC</description>

      <title>Coordinated PSO-PID based longitudinal control with LPV-MPC based lateral control for autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving is achieved by controlling the coupled nonlinear longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. Longitudinal control greatly affects lateral dynamics and must preserve lateral stability conditions, while lateral controllers must take into account actuator limits and ride comfort. This work deals with the coordinated longitudinal and lateral control for autonomous driving. An improved particle swarm optimized PID (PSO-PID) is proposed to handle the task of speed tracking based on nonlinear longitudinal dynamics. An enhanced linear parameter varying model predictive controller (LPV-MPC) is also designed to control lateral dynamics, the latter is formulated with an adaptive LPV model in which the tire cornering stiffness coefficients are estimated by a recursive estimator. The proposed LPV-MPC is enhanced with an improved cost function to provide better performance and stability. Matlab/Carsim co-simulations are carried out to validate the proposed controllers.

      <title>Nearly Optimal Chaotic Desynchronization of Neural Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by deep brain stimulation treatment of neural disorders such as Parkinson's disease, it has been proposed that desynchronization of neural oscillators can be achieved by maximizing the Lyapunov exponent of the phase difference between pairs of oscillators. Here we consider two approximations to optimal stimuli for chaotic desynchronization of neural oscillators. These approximations are based on the oscillators' phase response curve, and unlike previous approaches do not require numerical solution of a two-point boundary value problem. It is shown that these approximations can achieve nearly optimal desynchronization, and can be used with an event-based control scheme to desynchronize populations of noisy, coupled neurons.</description>

      <title>Design, modeling and control of a hybrid grid-connected photovoltaic-wind system for the region of Adrar, Algeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of fossil energy for electricity production is an evident source of pollution, global warming and climate change. Consequently, researchers have been working to shift toward sustainable and clean energy by exploiting renewable an environmentally friendly resources such as wind and solar energies. On the other hand, energy security can only be achieved by considering multiple resources. Large-scale renewable energy power plants are a key solution for diversifying the total energy mix and ensuring energy security. This paper presents a contribution to diversify the energy mix in Algeria and help mitigate power shortages and improve grid performance. In particular, the paper aims at designing and modeling a large-scale hybrid photovoltaic-wind system that is grid connected. An innovative control approach using improved particle swarm optimized PI controllers is proposed to control the hybrid system and generate the maximum power from the available wind and solar energy resources. Furthermore, economic, environmental and feasibility studies of the project were conducted using HOMER software to assess the viability of the system and its contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

      <title>Inexact and Stochastic Gradient Optimization Algorithms with Inertia and Hessian Driven Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a real Hilbert space setting, we study the convergence properties of an inexact gradient algorithm featuring both viscous and Hessian driven damping for convex differentiable optimization. In this algorithm, the gradient evaluation can be subject to deterministic and stochastic perturbations. In the deterministic case, we show that under appropriate summability assumptions on the perturbation, our algorithm enjoys fast convergence of the objective values, of the gradients and weak convergence of the iterates toward a minimizer of the objective. In the stochastic case, assuming the perturbation is zero-mean, we can weaken our summability assumptions on the error variance and provide fast convergence of the values both in expectation and almost surely. We also improve the convergence rates from $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ to $o(\cdot)$ in almost sure sense. We also prove almost sure summability property of the gradients, which implies the almost sure fast convergence of the gradients towards zero. We will highlight the trade-off between fast convergence and the applicable regime on the sequence of errors in the gradient computations. We finally report some numerical results to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Automatic Structure Identification for Highly Nonlinear MIMO Volterra Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Volterra Tensor Network lifts the curse of dimensionality for truncated, discrete times Volterra models, enabling scalable representation of highly nonlinear system. This scalability comes at the cost of introducing randomness through initialization, and leaves open the challenge of how to efficiently determine the hyperparameters model order and memory length. In this paper, we present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges: We derive two algorithms that incrementally increase the model order and memory length along. Further we proof that the updates are performed along conjugate directions by establishing a mathematical equivalence between our proposed algorithms and equality constrained least squares systems. We present several strategies how to use our proposed algorithms for initialization and hyperparameter selection. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art Volterra Tensor Network and achieve competitive results to several state-of-the-art Volterra models.</description>

      <title>A Multiobjective Mathematical Model for Optimal Irrigation Water Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water resource management is vital for sustainable irrigation and food security under growing climatic and economic pressures. In this study, we develop two single-objective optimization models for irrigation planning, one that maximizes net benefit and the other that minimizes environmental flow deficiency, and benchmark them against previous works. We then extend the analysis to a multiobjective linear programming formulation solved through different approaches to evaluate trade-offs. Numerical experiments on the Muhuri Irrigation Project reveal three outcomes: (i) a complete scenario view with profits ranging from $0.2 \times 10^9$ to $1.497\times 10^9$ and environmental flow deficits between 0 and 1200 GL, where the 1200 GL represents the theoretical annual maximum under a 100 GL uniform monthly target; (ii) explicit trade-offs showing higher profits correspond to greater ecological shortfalls; and (iii) an integration-based approach producing nearly 1000 Pareto-optimal solutions within seconds, greatly outperforming earlier studies.</description>

      <title>Green Inventory Management: Leveraging Multiobjective Reverse Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) inventory model within a reverse logistics framework, addressing new and repaired products with varying quality and demand patterns. The model integrates production and remanufacturing rates as functions of lot sizes and cycle numbers to develop a feasible inventory cost function. A key contribution of the study is formulating a multiobjective optimization framework that simultaneously minimizes inventory costs and accounts for environmental sustainability by considering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption during production processes. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, with integer constraints on lot sizes and cycle counts and a continuous return rate. Numerical case studies taking test problems from existing literature are used to validate the model through extensive sensitivity analyses. Both mathematical optimization and heuristic optimization methods are applied to solve multiobjective optimization problems, and Pareto fronts are illustrated along with the interpretation of the results. The results, obtained using solvers in MATLAB and AMPL, highlight the models ability to balance operational efficiency and environmental responsibility. Pareto frontiers generated from the analysis provide strategic insights for decision-makers seeking to optimize cost and sustainability in inventory systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Large-Margin Classification via Dual Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.</description>

      <title>FEM-based A-optimal sensor placement for heat source inversion from final time measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the field of optimal experimental design, \emph{sensor placement} refers to the act of finding the optimal locations of data collecting sensors, with the aim to optimise reconstruction of an unknown parameter from finite data. In this work, we investigate sensor placement for the inverse problem of reconstructing a heat source given final time measurements. Employing forward and adjoint analysis of this PDE-driven model, we show how one can leverage the first author's recently invented \emph{redundant-dominant $p$-continuation} algorithm to obtain binary A-optimal sensor placements also for this time-dependent model.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian AdaGrad-Norm Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a manifold AdaGrad-Norm method (\textsc{MAdaGrad}), which extends the norm version of AdaGrad (AdaGrad-Norm) to Riemannian optimization. In contrast to line-search schemes, which may require several exponential map computations per iteration, \textsc{MAdaGrad} requires only one. Assuming the objective function $f$ has Lipschitz continuous Riemannian gradient, we show that the method requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations to compute a point $x$ such that $\|\operatorname{grad} f(x)\|\leq \varepsilon$. Under the additional assumptions that $f$ is geodesically convex and the manifold has sectional curvature bounded from below, we show that the method takes at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to find $x$ such that $f(x)-f_{low}\leq\epsilon$, where $f_{low}$ is the optimal value. Moreover, if $f$ satisfies the Polyak--\L{}ojasiewicz condition globally on the manifold, we establish a complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$, provided that the norm of the initial Riemannian gradient is sufficiently large. For the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we construct a family of nonconvex functions satisfying the PL condition. Numerical experiments illustrate the remarkable performance of \textsc{MAdaGrad} in comparison with Riemannian Steepest Descent equipped with Armijo line-search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the barges shipping problem, also known as the tugboats scheduling problem, within the context of a scenario where a single tugboat has the capacity to tow multiple barges and conduct multiple trips in a drop-and-pull mode during a daily work shift. The problem is mathematically formalized as mixed-integer programming models. To tackle real-world-sized problem instances, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm integrated with a decoding mathematical model is proposed. When applied to large-scale instances, the ALNS algorithm showcases performance superiority over the strengthened mathematical model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a minimal time control problem for the heat equation with multiple impulse controls. We first establish the maximum principles for this problem and then prove the equivalence between the minimal time impulse control problem and its corresponding minimal norm impulse control problem. Extending our analysis to the minimal time function itself, we examine its analytical properties (particularly continuity and monotonicity) with respect to the control constraint. This leads to a notable discovery: despite being continuous and generally monotonic, the function may fail to be strictly decreasing.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regularization by Smooth Non-separable Non-convex Penalty Function Based on Ultra-discretization Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sparse optimization, the $\ell_{1}$ norm is widely adopted for its convexity, yet it often yields solutions with smaller magnitudes than expected. To mitigate this drawback, various non-convex sparse penalties have been proposed. Some employ non-separability, with ordered weighting as an effective example, to retain large components while suppressing small ones. Motivated by these approaches, we propose ULPENS, a non-convex, non-separable sparsity-inducing penalty function that enables control over the suppression of elements. Derived from the ultra-discretization formula, ULPENS can continuously interpolate between the $\ell_{1}$ norm and a non-convex selective suppressing function by adjusting parameters inherent to the formula. With the formula, ULPENS is smooth, allowing the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. We establish key theoretical properties of ULPENS and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of integer-constrained optimization problems governed by partial differential equation (PDE) constraints and regularized via total variation (TV) in the context of topology optimization. The presence of discrete design variables, nonsmooth regularization, and non-convex objective renders the problem computationally challenging. To address this, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables a decomposition of the original problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved efficiently.

      <title>Lyndon Word Transduction to Improve the Efficiency of Computing Chen-Fliess Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of input-output systems representable as Chen-Fliess series arises often in control theory. One well known drawback of this representation, however, is that the iterated integrals which appear in these series are algebraically related by the shuffle product. This becomes relevant when one wants to numerically evaluate these series in applications, as this redundancy leads to unnecessary computational expense. The general goal of this paper is to present a computationally efficient way to evaluate these series by introducing what amounts to a change of basis for the computation. The key idea is to use the fact that the shuffle algebra on (proper) polynomials over a finite alphabet is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra generated by the Lyndon words over this alphabet. The iterated integrals indexed by Lyndon words contain all the input information needed to compute the output. The change of basis is accomplished by applying a transduction, that is, a linear map between formal power series in different alphabets, to re-index the Chen-Fliess series in terms of Lyndon monomials. The method is illustrated using a simulation of a continuously stirred-tank reactor system under a cyber-physical attack.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control in Infinite Dimensional Spaces and Economic Modeling: State of the Art and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey collects, within a unified framework, various results (primarily by the authors themselves) on the use of Deterministic Infinite-Dimensional Optimal Control Theory to address applied economic models. The main aim is to illustrate, through several examples, the typical features of such models (including state constraints, non-Lipschitz data, and non-regularizing differential operators) and the corresponding methods needed to handle them. This necessitates developing aspects of the existing Deterministic Infinite-Dimensional Optimal Control Theory (see, e.g., the book by Li and Yong, 2012) in specific and often nontrivial directions. Given the breadth of this area, we emphasize the Dynamic Programming Approach and its application to problems where explicit or quasi-explicit solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations can be obtained. We also provide insights and references for cases where such explicit solutions are not available.</description>

      <title>A twice continuously differentiable penalty function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a twice continuously differentiable penalty function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems. In some optimization methods, such as penalty methods and augmented Lagrangian methods, their convergence property can be ensured by incorporating a penalty function into them, and hence several types of penalty functions have been proposed. In particular, these functions are designed to apply optimization methods to find first-order stationary points. Meanwhile, in recent years, second-order sequential optimality, such as Approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker2 (AKKT2) and Complementarity AKKT2 (CAKKT2) conditions, has been introduced, and the development of methods for such second-order stationary points would be required in future research. However, existing well-known penalty functions have low compatibility with such methods because they are not twice continuously differentiable. In contrast, the proposed function is expected to have a high affinity for methods to find second-order stationary points. To verify the high affinity, we also present a practical penalty method to find points that satisfy the AKKT and CAKKT conditions by exploiting the proposed function and show their convergence properties.</description>

      <title>Voltage-sensitive distribution factors for contingency analysis and topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a promising approach for mitigating congestion and managing changing grid conditions, but it is computationally challenging and requires approximations. Conventional distribution factors like PTDFs and LODFs, based on DC power flow, fail to capture voltage variations, reactive power, and losses - limiting their use in detailed optimization tasks such as busbar splitting. This paper introduces generalized distribution factors derived from a voltage-sensitive linearization of the full AC power flow equations. The proposed formulation accurately reflects reactive power flows, Ohmic losses, and voltage deviations while remaining computationally efficient. We derive and evaluate generalized PTDFs, LODFs, and topology modification factors using matrix identities. We discuss potential applications including voltage-aware N-1 security analysis, and topology optimization with a focus on busbar splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate close agreement with full AC solutions, significantly outperforming the traditional DC approximation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential resource integration under passenger-freight shared mobility: collaborative optimization of multi-type bus scheduling and dynamic vehicle capacity allocation for urban-rural bus routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the global background of developing urban-rural travel patterns, traditional urban-rural public transport systems are generally faced with the serious challenges of passenger loss and operating deficit, leading to a reduction in the bus frequency and service reliability. In order to break the vicious circle of demand decline-supply shrinkage, passenger-freight shared mobility (PFSM), an innovative operation mode, can achieve synergies between urban-rural logistics and public transport services by integrating public transit network resources and vehicle spare capacity. However, PFSM has changed the operating characteristics of urban-rural bus systems, posing some new challenges. To expand the relevant theory and find the solutions to those challenges, this study proposes an economy-efficiency-low-carbon -oriented resource reconfiguration strategy by formulating the collaborative bilevel optimization of multi-type bus scheduling and dynamic vehicle capacity allocation for urban-rural bus routes. The improved jellyfish search algorithm is developed to solve the premature convergence problem of the traditional algorithms in solving a high-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuous optimization. The results of a case of two urban-rural bus lines in Shanxi Province, China, indicate that the proposed scheme can improve operating revenue by 328.45% and reduce freight carbon emissions by 19.12 tons/year within the increase of 19.46% in average passenger travel time. The sensitivity analysis explicates key parameters selected for PFSM in terms of economic, efficiency and environmental dimensions. The proposed method provides some novel insights and solutions for the sustainable development of urban-rural public transport systems and the last kilometer problem of rural logistics, with significant values of both economic growth and environmental carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Approximation Analysis of the Entropic Penalty in Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic assignment problems are a fundamental class of combinatorial optimization problems which are ubiquitous in applications, yet their exact resolution is NP-hard. To circumvent this impasse, it was proposed to regularize such problems via an entropic penalty, leading to computationally tractable proxies. Indeed, this enabled efficient algorithms, notably in the context of Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problems, but it is unknown how well solutions of the regularized problem approximate those of the original one for small regularization parameters. Treating the broader framework of general quadratic programs (QPs), we establish that the approximation gap decays exponentially quickly for concave QPs, while the rate for general indefinite or convex QPs can be as slow as linear. Our analysis builds on the study of the entropic penalty in linear programming by leveraging a new representation for concave QPs, which connects them to a family of linear programs with varying costs. Building on these results, we design an algorithm which, given a local solution of the entropic QP, returns a candidate minimizer of the original QP and certifies it. We apply these findings to a general class of discrete GW problems, yielding new variational forms and the first exponentially vanishing entropic approximation bound in the GW literature.</description>

      <title>Unifying HJB and Riccati equations: A Koopman operator approach to nonlinear optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an operator-theoretic framework that recasts the minimal value function of a nonlinear optimal control problem as an abstract bilinear form on a suitable function space. The resulting bilinear form is shown to satisfy an operator equation with quadratic nonlinearity obtained by formulating the Lyapunov equation for a Koopman lift of the optimal closed-loop dynamics to an infinite-dimensional state space. It is proven that the minimal value function admits a rapidly convergent sum-of-squares expansion, a direct consequence of the fast spectral decay of the bilinear form. The framework thereby establishes a natural link between the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and a Riccati-like operator equation and further motivates numerical low-rank schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general method for deriving prognostics-based predictive maintenance policies. The method takes into account the available decision options at hand, the information on the future state of the system provided by a prognostic model, as well as the costs of the underlying renewal-reward process. It results in heuristic policies with only a few parameters, which can be determined based on theoretical considerations or by optimization from run-to-failure data. We show the potential of the method on two separate predictive maintenance decision settings, namely preventive replacement and preventive ordering. Numerical investigations show that the derived heuristic policies achieve significantly lower cost ratios than other benchmark heuristic policies, while at the same time being more robust against overfitting.</description>

      <title>Beyond adjacency: Graph encoding with reachability and shortest paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is central to many scientific and industrial domains, where the goal is often to optimize objectives defined over graph structures. Given the combinatorial complexity of graph spaces, such optimization problems are typically addressed using heuristic methods, and it remains unclear how to systematically incorporate structural constraints to effectively reduce the search space. This paper introduces explicit optimization formulations for graph search space that encode properties such as reachability and shortest paths. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating the correctness and completeness of our graph encoding. To address the symmetry issues arising from graph isomorphism, we propose lexicographic constraints over neighborhoods to eliminate symmetries and theoretically prove that adding those constraints will not reduce the original graph space. Our graph encoding, along with the corresponding symmetry-breaking constraints, forms the basis for downstream optimization tasks over graph spaces.</description>

      <title>Robust Near-Optimal Nonlinear Target Enclosing Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear optimal guidance law that enables a pursuer to enclose a target within arbitrary geometric patterns, which extends beyond conventional circular encirclement. The design operates using only relative state measurements and formulates a target enclosing guidance law in which the vehicle's lateral acceleration serves as the steering control, making it well-suited for aerial vehicles with turning constraints. Our approach generalizes and extends existing guidance strategies that are limited to target encirclement and provides a degree of optimality. At the same time, the exact information of the target's maneuver is unnecessary during the design. The guidance law is developed within the framework of a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE), thereby providing a systematic way to handle nonlinear dynamics through a pseudo-linear representation to design locally optimal feedback guidance commands through state-dependent weighting matrices. While SDRE ensures near-optimal performance in the absence of strong disturbances, we further augment the design to incorporate an integral sliding mode manifold to compensate when disturbances push the system away from the nominal trajectory, and demonstrate that the design provides flexibility in the sense that the (possibly time-varying) stand-off curvature could also be treated as unknown. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners via Certified Local Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).</description>

      <title>FusedANN: Convexified Hybrid ANN via Attribute-Vector Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated FREDopt package for simultaneous dose and LETd proton radiotherapy plan optimization via superiorization methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization. Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume size-satisfactory for clinical and research applications while enabling further development of the well-tested, documented open-source software.</description>

      <title>Reproduction Number and Spatial Connectivity Structure Estimation via Graph Sparsity-Promoting Penalized Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Properties of Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover, we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study of global asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>On Robustness of Consensus over Pseudo-Undirected Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or directed communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in information exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states, while directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root nodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on achievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network topologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional connectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to differ, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions. The resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus under connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the system to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull of the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights for a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous interception of a moving target.</description>

      <title>A Recovery Guarantee for Sparse Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks, where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered. Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Feedback Learning in Online Convex Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers convex games involving multiple agents that aim to minimize their own cost functions using locally available information. A common assumption in the study of such games is that the agents are symmetric, meaning that they have access to the same type of information. Here we lift this assumption, which is often violated in practice, and instead consider asymmetric agents; specifically, we assume some agents have access to first-order gradient information and others have access to the zeroth-order oracles (cost function evaluations). We propose an asymmetric learning algorithm that combines the agent information mechanisms. We analyze the regret and Nash equilibrium convergence of this algorithm for convex and strongly monotone games, respectively. Specifically, we show that our algorithm always performs between pure first- and zeroth-order methods, and can match the performance of these two extremes by adjusting the number of agents with access to zeroth-order oracles. Therefore, our algorithm incorporates the pure first- and zeroth-order methods as special cases. We provide numerical experiments on a market problem for both deterministic and risk-averse games to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop and provide a rigorous treatment to the problem of entropy regularized fine-tuning in the context of continuous-time diffusion models, which was recently proposed by Uehara et al. (arXiv:2402.15194, 2024). The idea is to use stochastic control for sample generation, where the entropy regularizer is introduced to mitigate reward collapse. We also show how the analysis can be extended to fine-tuning with a general $f$-divergence regularizer. Numerical experiments on large-scale text-to-image models--Stable Diffusion v1.5 are conducted to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Fair Clustering with Minimum Representation Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is a well-studied unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data points into a number of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g., electoral districts, playlists, TV channels), where a group (e.g., social or demographic) benefits only if it reaches a minimum level of representation in the cluster (e.g., 50% to elect their preferred candidate). In this paper, we study the k-means and k-medians clustering problems under the additional fairness constraint that each group must attain a minimum level of representation in at least a specified number of clusters. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer (nonlinear) optimization problem and propose an alternating minimization algorithm, called MiniReL, to solve it. Although incorporating fairness constraints results in an NP-hard assignment problem within the MiniReL algorithm, we present several heuristic strategies that make the approach practical even for large datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that our method yields fair clusters without increasing clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>On the inadequacy of nudging data assimilation algorithms for non-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the applicability of the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) nudging algorithm for continuous data assimilation to evolutionary dynamical systems that are not dissipative. Specifically, we apply the AOT algorithm to a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in 1D, and the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Our analysis reveals that both the Euler and KdV equations lack the finitely many determining modes property, leading to the construction of infinitely many solutions with exactly the same sparse observational data, which data assimilation methods cannot distinguish between. Simultaneously, we numerically verify that the AOT algorithm successfully recovers these counterexamples for the damped and driven KdV equation, which is dissipative. Additionally, to further support our argument, we present numerical evidence showing that the AOT algorithm is ineffective at accurately recovering solutions for a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system.</description>

Abstract: We develop an energy management system (EMS) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers with colocated renewable generation. Under a cost-minimizing framework, the EMS of renewable-colocated data center (RCDC) co-optimizes AI workload scheduling, on-site renewable utilization, and electricity market participation. Within both wholesale and retail market participation models, the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized. Empirical evaluations using real-world traces of electricity prices, data center power consumption, and renewable generation demonstrate significant electricity cost reduction from renewable and AI data center colocations.</description>

      <title>Introducing the method of ellipcenters, a new first order technique for unconstrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Method of Ellipcenters (ME) for unconstrained minimization. At the cost of two gradients per iteration and a line search, we compute the next iterate by setting it as the center of an elliptical interpolation. The idea behind the ellipse built in each step is to emulate the original level curve of the objective function constrained to a suitable two-dimensional affine space, which is determined by the current iterate and two appropriate gradient vectors. We present the method for general unconstrained minimization and carry out a convergence analysis for the case where the objective function is quadratic. In this context, ME enjoys linear convergence with the rate being at least as good as the linear rate of the steepest descent (gradient) method with optimal step. In our experiments, however, ME was much faster than the gradient method with optimal step size. Moreover, ME seems highly competitive in comparison to several well established algorithms, including Nesterov's accelerated gradient, Barzilai-Borwein, and conjugate gradient. The efficiency in terms of both time and number of iterations is stressed even more for ill-conditioned problems. A theoretical feature that might be a reason for this is that ME coincides with Newton for quadratic programs in two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, solving them in one single step. In our numerical tests, convergence in one iteration only was also observed for much larger problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Explicit Steady-State Approximations for Parallel Server Systems with Heterogeneous Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state performance of parallel-server systems under an immediate routing architecture with two sources of heterogeneity: servers and job classes, subject to compatibility constraints. We focus on the weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) policy, a load-balancing scheme known to be throughput-optimal for such systems. Under a relaxed complete-resource-pooling (CRP) condition, we prove a "strong form" of state-space collapse in heavy traffic and that the scaled workload of each server converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, whose parameter is explicitly given by system primitives. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, the conventional heavy-traffic requirement of a unique static allocation plan can be dropped; a relaxed CRP condition suffices. Second, the limiting workload distribution is shown to be independent of local scheduling policy on server side, allowing substantial flexibility. Third, the inefficient (non-basic) activities prescribed by static allocation plan is proved to receive an asymptotically negligible fraction of routing and service, even though WWTA has no prior knowledge of which activities are basic, highlighting its robustness to changing arrival rates.</description>

      <title>Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Probability-One Optimization of Generalized Rayleigh Quotient Sum For Multi-Source Generalized Total Least-Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they fail to reliably converge to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of the Riemannian Trust Region algorithm based on the probability-one homotopy optimization method, which enhances convergence to a global maximizer and, under certain conditions, ensures convergence to the global maximizer. In addition to the proposed method, existing state-of-the-art approaches are also presented, along with an explanation of their limitations and their connection to the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated alongside the state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, assessing convergence speed, success in reaching the global maximizer, and scalability with increasing problem dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.</description>

      <title>Infinite Euclidean Distance Discriminants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.</description>
