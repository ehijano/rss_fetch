      <title>Wavelet-based resolvent analysis of non-stationary flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a formulation of resolvent analysis that uses wavelet transforms rather than Fourier transforms in time. Under this formulation, resolvent analysis may extend to turbulent flows with non-stationary mean states; the optimal resolvent modes are augmented with a temporal dimension and are able to encode the time-transient trajectories that are most amplified by the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We first show that the wavelet- and Fourier-based resolvent analyses give equivalent results for statistically-stationary flow by applying them to turbulent channel flow. We then use wavelet-based resolvent analysis to study the transient growth mechanism in the logarithmic layer of a turbulent channel flow by windowing the resolvent operator in time and frequency. The computed principal resolvent response mode, i.e. the velocity field optimally amplified by the linearised dynamics of the flow, exhibits the Orr mechanism, supporting the claim that this mechanism is key to linear transient energy growth. We also apply this method to non-stationary parallel shear flows such as an oscillating boundary layer, and three-dimensional channel flow in which a sudden spanwise pressure gradient perturbs a fully-developed turbulent channel flow. In both cases, wavelet-based resolvent analysis yields modes that are sensitive to the changing mean profile of the flow. For the oscillating boundary layer, wavelet-based resolvent analysis produces oscillating principal forcing and response modes that peak at times and wall-normal locations associated with high turbulent activity. For the three-dimensional turbulent channel flow, the resolvent modes gradually realign themselves with the mean flow as it deviates.</description>

      <title>Water wave interactions with surface-piercing vertical barriers in a rectangular tank: Connections with Bloch waves and quasimodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenmodes are studied for a fluid-filled rectangular tank containing one or more vertical barriers, and on which either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are prescribed on the lateral walls. In the case where the tank contains a single barrier, the geometry of the tank is equivalent to the unit cell of the cognate periodic array, and its eigenmodes are equivalent to standing Bloch waves. As the submergence depth of the barrier increases, it is shown that the passbands (i.e.\ frequency intervals in which the periodic array supports Bloch waves) become thinner, and that this effect becomes stronger at higher frequencies. The eigenmodes of a uniform array of vertical barriers in a rectangular tank are also considered. They are found to be a superposition of left- and right-propagating Bloch waves, which couple together at the lateral walls of the tank. A homotopy procedure is used to relate the eigenmodes to the quasimodes of the same uniform array in a fluid of infinite horizontal extent, and the quasimodes are shown to govern the response of the array to incident waves. Qualitative features of the mode shapes are typically preserved by the homotopy, which suggests that the resonant responses of the array in an infinite fluid can be understood in terms of modes of the array in a finite tank.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian meshfree model for solidification of liquid thin-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new method to model solidification of thin liquid films is proposed. \blue{This method is targeted at applications like aircraft icing and tablet coating where the formation of liquid films from impinging droplets on a surface form a critical part of the physics of the process.} The proposed model takes into account the (i) unsteadiness in temperature distribution, (ii) heat transfer at the interface between the solid and the surface, (iii) volumetric expansion/contraction and (iv) the liquid thin-film behaviour, each of which are either partly or fully ignored in existing models. The liquid thin-film, modeled using the Discrete Droplet Method (DDM), is represented as a collection of discrete droplets that are tracked in a Lagrangian sense. The height of the liquid film is estimated as a summation of Gaussian kernel functions associated with each droplet. At each droplet location, a solid height is also computed. The evolution of the solid height is governed by the Stefan problem. The flow of the liquid thin-film is solved just as in the case of DDM, while also taking into consideration the shape of the solidified region lying beneath the droplet. The results presented in this work show the reliability of the proposed model in simulating solidification of thin-films and its applicability to complex problems such as ice-formation on aircraft wings. The model has been verified for canonical problems that have analytical solutions. For the more complex problems of icing, the results of the model are compared with data from literature, without considering a background air flow. The comparison can be improved by coupling this model with suitable air flow solvers, as shown in the final test case.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of unsteady flow based on deep operator network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent flow fields are typically generated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, which is an extremely time-consuming process. However, the latent relationship between the flow fields is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and can be described by an operator. We therefore train a deep operator network, or simply DeepONet, to learn the temporal evolution between flow snapshots. Once properly trained, given a few consecutive snapshots as input, the network has a great potential to generate the next snapshot accurately and quickly. Using the output as a new input, the network iterates the process, generating a series of successive snapshots with little wall time. Specifically, we consider 2D flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 1000, and prepare a set of high-fidelity data using a high-order spectral/hp element method as ground truth. Although the flow fields are periodic, there are many small-scale features in the wake flow that are difficult to generate accurately. Furthermore, any discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth for the first snapshots can easily accumulate during the iterative process, which eventually amplifies the overall deviations. Therefore, we propose two alternative techniques to improve the training of DeepONet. The first one enhances the feature extraction of the network by harnessing the "multi-head non-local block". The second one refines the network parameters by leveraging the local smooth optimization technique. Both techniques prove to be highly effective in reducing the cumulative errors and our results outperform those of the dynamic mode decomposition method.</description>

      <title>Identification of Settling Velocity with Physics Informed Neural Networks For Sediment Laden Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown great potential in the context of fluid dynamics simulations, particularly in reconstructing flow fields and identifying key parameters. In this study, we explore the application of PINNs to recover the dimensionless settling velocity for sedimentation flow. The flow involves sediment-laden fresh water overlying salt water, which is described by Navier-Stokes equations coupled with sediment concentration and salinity transport equations. Two cases are investigated: one where the training data contains the salinity and sediment concentration fields, and another where it contains the velocity field. For both cases, we investigate several flow regimes and show that the model is capable of inferring the unknown parameter and reconstructing the hydrodynamic field of the flow. The quality of the model inference is assessed by comparing it with numerical simulations from a high-fidelity semi-Lagrangian solver. We demonstrate the model's robustness to noise by training it with data corrupted by noise of varying magnitudes, highlighting the potential of PINNs for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The fluid dynamics of a viscoelastic fluid dripping onto a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensional flows of complex fluids are pivotal in industrial applications like spraying, atomisation, and microfluidic drop deposition. The Dripping-on-Substrate (DoS) technique is a conceptually simple, but dynamically-complex, probe of the extensional rheology of low-viscosity, non-Newtonian fluids. DoS involves capillary-driven thinning of a liquid bridge formed by a slowly dispensed drop onto a partially-wetting solid substrate. By following the filament thinning and pinch-off, the extensional viscosity and relaxation time can be determined. Importantly, DoS enables measurements for lower viscosity solutions than commercially available capillary break-up extensional rheometers. To understand DoS operation, we employ a computational rheology approach via adaptively-refined, time-dependent axisymmetric simulations using the open-source Eulerian code, \textit{Basilisk}. The volume-of-fluid technique is used to capture the moving interface, and the log-conformation transformation enables a stable viscoelastic solution. We focus on understanding the roles of surface tension, elasticity, and finite chain extensibility in the Elasto-Capillary (EC) regime. Additionally, we explore perturbative effects of gravity and substrate wettability in setting the evolution of the self-similar thinning and pinch-off dynamics. To illustrate the interplay of these different forces, we construct a simple one-dimensional model capturing the initial thinning rates, balancing inertia and capillarity. This model also describes the structure of the transition region to the nonlinear EC regime, where elastic stresses counteract capillary pressure in the thread as the filament thins toward breakup. Finally, we propose a fitting methodology based on the analytical solutions for FENE-P fluids to enhance accuracy in determining the effective relaxation time for unknown fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new models of stochastic Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by using a symmetry-reduced stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. The new stochastic Hall MHD theory has potential applications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in space plasma (space weather) and solar physics. The stochastic geometric mechanics approach we take here produces coordinate-free results which may then be applied in a variety of spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>Four-fifths laws in incompressible and magnetized fluids: Helicity, Energy and Cross-helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the Kolmogorov's scaling laws of conserved quantities. By means of Eyink's longitudinal structure functions and the analysis of interaction of different physical quantities, we extend celebrated four-fifths laws from energy to helicity in incompressible fluid and, energy and cross-helicity in magnetohydrodynamic flow. In contrast to pervious 4/5 laws of energy and cross-helicity in magnetized fluids obtained by Politano and Pouquet, they are in terms of the mixed three-order structure functions rather than the structure coupling correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Hopf bifurcation of a non-parallel Navier-Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plane non-parallel flow in a square fluid domain exhibits an odd number of vortices. A spectral structure is found to have a non-real solution of the spectral problem linearized around the flow. With the use of this structure, Hopf bifurcation or secondary time periodic flows branching of a basic square eddy flow is found. In contrast to a square eddy flow involving an even number of vortices in earlier analytical and experimental investigations, instability of the flow leads to steady-state bifurcations.</description>

      <title>StageOpt technical write-up</title>

Abstract: This document provides technical background for StageOpt. This tool helps to better understand fluid and proppant distribution between perforations and clusters within a fracturing stage. Limited entry technique is often used to achieve uniform fluid distribution between clusters. This, however, does not automatically guarantee uniform proppant distribution. In view of this observation, StageOpt allows users to overcome this obstacle and to better design perforation design by focusing on both fluid and proppant distribution between clusters. The algorithm in StageOpt is based primarily on the paper Dontsov (2023), but it also incorporates practically important features, such as the effect of stress shadow from previous stage, perforation erosion, and other phenomena. In this write-up, flow distribution between perforations is described first, and the effects of perforation friction, near-wellbore pressure drop, as well as perforation break down and stress shadow are included. Then, proppant distribution between perforations is discussed as a function of perforation orientation. Finally, perforation erosion is added to the model. The erosion changes perforation diameter as a function of several parameters, including the flow rate through the perforation as well as the amount of proppant that flows through it. The change of perforation size in turn changes magnitude of perforation friction, which then changes the distribution of slurry, that consequently changes proppant flow distribution. Such a coupled system often leads to complex results that are hard to deduce without systematic physical modeling, which is exactly what StageOpt provides.</description>

      <title>Model-based deep reinforcement learning for accelerated learning from flow simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a technique to solve closed-loop flow control problems. Employing simulation-based environments in reinforcement learning enables a priori end-to-end optimization of the control system, provides a virtual testbed for safety-critical control applications, and allows to gain a deep understanding of the control mechanisms. While reinforcement learning has been applied successfully in a number of rather simple flow control benchmarks, a major bottleneck toward real-world applications is the high computational cost and turnaround time of flow simulations. In this contribution, we demonstrate the benefits of model-based reinforcement learning for flow control applications. Specifically, we optimize the policy by alternating between trajectories sampled from flow simulations and trajectories sampled from an ensemble of environment models. The model-based learning reduces the overall training time by up to $85\%$ for the fluidic pinball test case. Even larger savings are expected for more demanding flow simulations.</description>
