      <title>IDA function and asymptotic behavior of singular values of Hankel operators on weighted Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the non-increasing rearrangement of ${\rm IDA}$ function with respect to a suitable measure to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the singular values sequence $\{s_n(H_f)\}_n$ of Hankel operators $H_f$ acting on a large class of weighted Bergman spaces, including standard Bergman spaces on the unit disc, standard Fock spaces and weighted Fock spaces. As a corollary, we show that the simultaneous asymptotic behavior of $\{s_n(H_f)\}$ and $\{s_n(H_{\bar{f}})\}$ can be characterized in terms of the asymptotic behavior of non-increasing rearrangement of mean oscillation function. Moreover, in the context of weighted Fock spaces, we demonstrate the Berger-Coburn phenomenon concerning the membership of Hankel operators in the weak Schatten $p$-class.</description>

      <title>Polynomials with exponents in compact convex sets and associated weighted extremal functions -- Approximations and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various regularization operators on plurisubharmonic functions that preserve Lelong classes with growth given by certain compact convex sets. The purpose is to show that the weighted Siciak-Zakharyuta functions associated with these Lelong classes are lower semicontinuous. These operators are given by integral, infimal, and supremal convolutions. Continuity properties of the logarithmic supporting function are studied and a precise description is given of when it is uniformly continuous. This gives a contradiction to published results about the H\"older continuity of these Siciak-Zakharyuta functions.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the Carath\'eodory and Szeg\"o metrics on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several intrinsic properties of the Carath\'eodory and Szeg\"o metrics on finitely connected planar domains. Among them are the existence of closed geodesics and geodesics spirals, boundary behaviour of Gaussian curvatures, and $L^2$-cohomology. A formula for the Szeg\"o metric in terms of the Weierstrass $\wp$-function is obtained. Variations of these metrics and their Gaussian curvatures on planar annuli are also studied. Consequently, we obtain optimal universal upper bounds for their Gaussian curvatures and show that no universal lower bounds exist for their Gaussian curvatures. Moreover, it follows that there are domains where the Gaussian curvatures assume both negative and positive values. Lastly, it is also observed that there is no universal upper bound for the ratio of the Szeg\"o and Carath\'eodory metrics.</description>

      <title>Clark Measures Associated with Rational Inner Functions on Bounded Symmetric Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded symmetric domain $D$ in $\mathbb C^n$, we consider the Clark measures $\mu_\alpha$, $\alpha\in \mathbb T$, associated with a rational inner function $\varphi$ from $D$ into the unit disc in $\mathbb C$. We show that $\mu_\alpha=c|\nabla \varphi|^{-1}\chi_{\mathrm b D \cap \varphi^{-1}(\alpha)}\cdot \mathcal H^{m-1}$, where $m$ is the dimension of the Shilov boundary $\mathrm b D$ of $D$ and $c$ is a suitable constant. Denoting with $H^2(\mu_\alpha)$ the closure of the space of holomorphic polynomials in $L^2(\mu_\alpha)$, we characterize the $\alpha$ for which $H^2(\mu_\alpha)=L^2(\mu_\alpha)$ when $D$ is a polydisc; we also provide some necessary and some sufficient conditions for general domains.</description>

      <title>Cubic Siegel polynomials and the bifurcation measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that cubic polynomial maps with a fixed Siegel disk and a critical orbit eventually landing inside that Siegel disk lie in the support of the bifurcation measure. This answers a question of Dujardin in positive.
  Our result implies the existence of holomorphic disks in the support of the bifurcation measure, and also implies that the set of rigid parameters is not closed in the moduli space of cubic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless Dirac operators and canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study canonical systems that are reflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the two half line $m$ functions are holomorphic continuations of each other and may thus be combined into a single holomorphic function. This idea was explored in [11], and we continue these investigations here. We focus on Dirac operators and especially their interplay with canonical systems, and we provide a more general and abstract framework.</description>

      <title>Spiders' webs in the Eremenko-Lyubich class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the entire function $f(z)=\cosh(z)$. We show that the escaping set of this function - that is, the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity under iteration - has a structure known as a "spider's web". This disproves a conjecture of Sixsmith from 2020. In fact, we show that the "fast escaping set", i.e. the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity at an iterated exponential rate, is a spider's web. This answers a question of Rippon and Stallard from 2012. We also discuss a wider class of functions to which our results apply, and state some open questions.</description>

      <title>A Dimca-Greuel type inequality for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation at $p\in\mathbb{C}^2$, and $B$ be a separatrix of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove the following Dimca-Greuel type inequality $3\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)-4\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)+GSV_p(\mathcal{F},B)\leq 0$, where $\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the multiplicity of $\mathcal{F}$ along $B$, $\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the dimension of the quotient of $\mathbb{C}\{x,y\}$ by the ideal generated by the components of any $1$-form defining $\mathcal{F}$ and any equation of $B$, and $GSV_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the \textit{G\'omez-Mont-Seade-Verjovsky index} of the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $B$. As a consequence, we provide a new proof of the $\frac{4}{3}$-Dimca-Greuel conjecture for singularities of irreducible plane curve germs, with foliations ingredients, that differs from those given by Alberich-Carrami\~nana, Almir\'on, Blanco, Melle-Hern\'andez and Genzmer-Hernandes, but it is in line with the idea developed by Wang.</description>

      <title>Convergence of random holomorphic functions with real zeros and extensions of the stochastic zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a unified framework for studying the convergence of rescaled characteristic polynomials of random matrices from various classical ensembles as well as functional convergence results for the Riemann zeta function. To this end, we consider the more general viewpoint of converging point processes (a special case of which is the sequence of converging eigenvalue point processes from random matrix ensembles), and we identify sufficient conditions under which the convergence of random point processes on the real line implies the convergence in law, for the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, of suitable random holomorphic functions whose zeros are given by the point processes which are considered. Our results extend convergence results for rescaled characteristic polynomials obtained by various authors (in the case of the circular unitary ensemble, the limiting random analytic function is called the stochasic zeta function). We also show that for a wide class of point processes associated with these limiting random holomorphic functions (we can often interpret these points as the spectrum of some random operator), their Stieltjes transform follows for almost all points of the real line the standard Cauchy distribution, reminiscent of the results by Aizenman and Warzel (\cite{AW15}) in the case of the sine kernel point process.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential excavation is common in shallow tunnel engineering, especially for large-span tunnels. However, existing complex variable solutions can not handle sequential shallow tunnelling effectively. This paper proposes a new complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement in a non-iterative manner by incorporating a bidirectional stepwise conformal mapping combining Charge Simulation Method and Complex Dipole Simulation Method. The non-iterative manner ensures that the mechanical models of sequential excavation stages share similar mathematical formation with non-successive mixed boundary conditions, which are respectively transformed into corresponding homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problems, and are solved to obtain stress and displacement fields of sequential shallow tunnelling. The proposed solution is subsequently validated by sufficient comparisons with equivalent finite element solution with good agreements. The comparisons also suggest that the proposed solution should be more accurate than the finite element one. A parametric investigation is finally conducted to illustrate possible practical applications of the proposed solution with several engineering recommendations. Additionally, the theoretical improvements and defects of the proposed solution are discussed for objectivity.</description>
