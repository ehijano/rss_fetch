      <title>Matrix-Valued Hermite and Laguerre polynomials via Quadratic Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic extension of the classical Hermite-Laguerre quadratic correspondence to the matrix-valued setting. Starting from a Hermite-type weight matrix W(x) = exp(-x^2) Z(x) with W(x) = W(-x), the change of variables y = x^2 produces two Laguerre-type weights with parameters alpha = -1/2 and alpha = 1/2, and relates the corresponding sequences of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials through an explicit decomposition into even and odd subsequences. We prove that this transformation preserves differential operators and Darboux transformations, thereby establishing a direct structural link between the Hermite and Laguerre sides and providing new constructive tools for the matrix Bochner problem. Concrete families - including a new 3x3 example and an arbitrary-size family built from block-nilpotent matrices - illustrate the theory and supply fresh sources of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials endowed with non-trivial differential algebras.</description>

      <title>The $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^n)-H^q(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ boundedness of discrete Riesz potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [J. Class. Anal., vol. 26 (1) (2025), 63-76], we proved that the discrete Riesz potential $I_{\alpha}$ is a bounded operator $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^n) \to H^q(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for $\frac{n-1}{n} &lt; p \leq 1$, $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{\alpha}{n}$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$. In this note, we extend such boundedness on the full range $0 &lt; p \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Fourier extension estimates on a strip in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth curve with nonzero curvature $\Sigma\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, let $E_{\Sigma}$ denote the associated Fourier extension operator. For both general compact curves and the parabola, we characterize the pairs $(p,q)\in [1,\infty]^2$ for which the estimates $\|E_{\Sigma}f\|_{L^q(\Omega)}\leq C\|f\|_{L^p(\Sigma)}$ and $(\mathcal{R}(|E_{\Sigma}f|^{q}))^{\frac{1}{q}}\leq C\|f\|_{L^p(\Sigma)}$ hold, where $\Omega$ is a strip in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the Radon transform. This work continues the study of mass concentration of $x\mapsto E_{\Sigma}f(x)$ near lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$, initiated by Bennett and Nakamura and later extended by Bennett, Nakamura, and the second author, where expressions of the form $(\mathcal{R}(|E_{\Sigma}f|^{2}))^{\frac{1}{2}}$ were studied.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Equivalence for Lam\'{e}-type Equations I: Finite-gap Structures and Cone Spherical Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the finite-gap structure of the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.2) and its central role in mathematical physics, generalized Lam\'{e}-type equations (1.12) are investigated. For the fundamental case $n=1$, a monodromy equivalence between the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.18) and the generalized Lam\'{e}-type equation (1.19) is established. Two main applications are obtained: (i) the finite-gap structure of \ (1.19) is derived, together with a complete classification of the spectral curves $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ for $\tau\in i\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$; and (ii) the monodromy equivalence is applied to the construction of cone spherical metrics with three large conical singularities, each with cone angle exceeding $2\pi$. A family of such metrics is shown to exhibits a blow-up configuration, which is described explicitly in terms of the monodromy data.</description>

      <title>A Closed-form Approximation for Impulse Response of Fractionally Damped Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fractionally damped oscillator, where the damping term is expressed by the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\beta\in (0,1).$ The impulse response of this oscillator can be expressed in terms of the bivariate Mittag-Leffler function consisting of a double infinite series. Although this series is uniformly convergent, its numerical implementation suffers from computational instabilities. In this contribution, we propose an approximate closed-form solution that avoids these numerical pitfalls while maintaining a reasonable accuracy. The resulting approximation is computationally efficient and robust, making it suitable for practical engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger Groups and Imaginary Power Operators on Weak Hardy Spaces Associated with Non-negative Self-adjoint Operators and Ball Quasi-Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{X},d,\mu)$ be a doubling metric measure space, $L$ a non-negative self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\mathbb{X})$ satisfying the Davies-Gaffney estimate, and $X(\mathbb{X})$ a ball quasi-Banach function space on $\mathbb{X}$ satisfying some mild assumptions with $p\in(0,\infty)$ and $s_0\in(0,\min\{p,1\}]$. In this article, the authors study the weak Hardy space $WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})$ associated with $L$ and $X(\mathbb{X})$, and then give the atomic and molecular decompositions of $WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})$. As applications, the authors establish the boundedness estimate of Schr\"{o}dinger groups for fractional powers of $L$ on $WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})$: $$\left\|(I+L)^{-\beta/2}e^{i\tau L^{\gamma/2}}f\right\|_{WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})}\leq C\left(1+|\tau|\right)^{n(\frac{1}{s_0}-\frac{r}{2})}\|f\|_{WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})},$$ where $0&lt;\gamma\neq1$, $\beta\in[\gamma n(\frac{1}{s_0}-\frac{1}{2}),\infty)$, $r\in(0,1]$, $\tau\in \mathbb{R}$, and $C&gt;0$ is a constant. Moreover, when $(\mathbb{X},d,\mu)$ is an Ahlfors $n$-regular metric measure space and $L$ satisfies the Gaussian upper bound estimate, the authors also obtain the boundedness estimate of imaginary power operators of $L$ on $WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})$: $$\left\|L^{i\tau}f\right\|_{WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})}\leq C\left(1+|\tau|\right)^{n(\frac{1}{s_0}-\frac{r}{2})}\|f\|_{WH_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})},$$ where $\alpha&gt;n(\frac{1}{s_0}-\frac{1}{2})$, $r\in(\frac{n/s_0}{\alpha+n/2},1]$, $\tau\in \mathbb{R}$, and $C&gt;0$ is a constant. These results are also novelty for strong Hardy spaces $H_{X,L}(\mathbb{X})$. Moreover, all these results have a wide range of generality and, particularly, even when they are applied to weighted Lebesgue spaces, mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces, Orlicz spaces, variable Lebesgue spaces and Euclidean spaces setting, these results are also new.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Sum-Product Algorithms under Stochastic Rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of numerical computations can be measured through their forward error, for which finding good error bounds is challenging in general. For several algorithms and using stochastic rounding (SR), probabilistic analysis has been shown to be an effective alternative for obtaining tight error bounds. This analysis considers the distribution of errors and evaluates the algorithm's performance on average. Using martingales and the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, it provides error bounds that are valid with a certain probability and in O($\sqrt$nu) instead of deterministic worst-case bounds in O(nu), where n is the number of operations and u is the unit roundoff. In this paper, we present a general method that automatically constructs a martingale for any computation scheme with multi-linear errors based on additions, subtractions, and multiplications. We apply this generalization to algorithms previously studied with SR, such as pairwise summation and the Horner algorithm, and prove equivalent results. We also analyze a previously unstudied algorithm, Karatsuba polynomial multiplication, which illustrates that the method can handle reused intermediate computations.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>
