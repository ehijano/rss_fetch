      <title>Exploring Loss Landscapes through the Lens of Spin Glass Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, significant strides in deep learning have led to numerous groundbreaking applications. Despite these advancements, the understanding of the high generalizability of deep learning, especially in such an over-parametrized space, remains limited. Successful applications are often considered as empirical rather than scientific achievements. For instance, deep neural networks' (DNNs) internal representations, decision-making mechanism, absence of overfitting in an over-parametrized space, high generalizability, etc., remain less understood. This paper delves into the loss landscape of DNNs through the lens of spin glass in statistical physics, i.e. a system characterized by a complex energy landscape with numerous metastable states, to better understand how DNNs work. We investigated a single hidden layer Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural network model, and introduced several protocols to examine the analogy between DNNs (trained with datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10) and spin glass. Specifically, we used (1) random walk in the parameter space of DNNs to unravel the structures in their loss landscape; (2) a permutation-interpolation protocol to study the connection between copies of identical regions in the loss landscape due to the permutation symmetry in the hidden layers; (3) hierarchical clustering to reveal the hierarchy among trained solutions of DNNs, reminiscent of the so-called Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) phenomenon (i.e. the Parisi solution) in analogy to spin glass; (4) finally, we examine the relationship between the degree of the ruggedness of the loss landscape of the DNN and its generalizability, showing an improvement of flattened minima.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <title>Chimera states and information transfer in interacting populations of map-based neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synchronization behavior and the emergence of chimera states in a system of two interacting populations of maps possessing chaotic neural-like dynamics. We characterize four collective states on the space of coupling parameters of the system: complete synchronization, generalized synchronization, chimera states, and incoherence. We quantify the information exchange between the two neuron populations in chimera states. We have found a well-defined direction of the flow of information in chimera states, from the desynchronized population to the synchronized one. The incoherent population functions as a driver of the coherent neuron population in a chimera state. This feature is independent of the population sizes or population partitions. Our results yield insight into the communication mechanisms arising in brain processes such as unihemispheric sleep and epileptic seizures that have been associated to chimera states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lecture notes on "Many-body Quantum Dynamics with MCTDH-X," adapted from the 2023 Heidelberg MCTDH Summer School, provide an in-depth exploration of the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree approach for indistinguishable particles. They serve as a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the MCTDH-X software for both bosonic and fermionic systems. The tutorial begins with an introduction to the MCTDH-X software, highlighting its capability to handle various quantum systems, including those with internal degrees of freedom and long-range interactions. The theoretical foundation is then laid out on how to solve the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equations for many-body systems. The workflow section provides practical instructions on setting up and executing simulations using MCTDH-X. Detailed benchmarks against exact solutions are presented, showcasing the accuracy and reliability of the software in ground-state and dynamic simulations. The notes then delve into the dynamics of quantum systems, covering relaxation processes, time evolution, and the analysis of propagation for both bosonic and fermionic particles. The discussion includes the interpretation of various physical quantities such as energy, density distributions, and orbital occupations. Advanced features of MCTDH-X are also explored in the last section, including the calculation of correlation functions and the creation of visualizations through video tutorials. The notes conclude with a Linux/UNIX command cheat sheet, facilitating ease of use for users operating the software on different systems. Overall, these lecture notes provide a valuable resource for researchers and students in the field of quantum dynamics, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance on the use of MCTDH-X for studying complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements ("soft spots"). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible, and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled states, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) states found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS states exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS state, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. None the less, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS state. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL states can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Thermalization propagation front and robustness against avalanches in localized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the many-body localized (MBL) phase to the quantum-avalanche instability by studying the dynamics of a localized spin chain coupled to a $T=\infty$ thermal bath through its leftmost site. By analyzing local magnetizations and quantum mutual information, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector of the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This logarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower bound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where it scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against thermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.</description>

      <title>Universal and nonuniversal statistics of transmission in thin random layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of transmission through random 1D media are generally presumed to be universal and to depend only upon a single dimensionless parameter-the ratio of the sample length and the mean free path, s = L/l. Here, we show in numerical simulations and optical measurements of random binary systems, and most prominently in systems for which s is less than unity, that the statistics of the logarithm of transmission, ln T, are universal for transmission near the upper cutoff of unity and depend distinctively upon the reflectivity of the layer interfaces and their number near a lower cutoff. The universal segment of the probability distribution function of the logarithm of transmission P (ln T) is manifested with as few as three binary layers. For a given value of s, P (ln T ) evolves towards a universal distribution as the number of layers increases. Optical measurements in stacks of 5 and 20 glass coverslips exhibit statistics at low and moderate values of transmission that are close to those found in simulations for 1D layered media, while differences appear at higher transmission where the transmission time in the medium is longer and the wave explores the transverse nonuniformity of the sample.</description>
