      <description>arXiv:2407.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman gave a famous elementary introduction to quantum theory by discussing the thin-film reflection of light. We make his discussion mathematically rigorous, keeping it elementary, using his other idea. The resulting model leads to accurate quantitative results and allows us to derive a well-known formula from optics. In the process, we get acquainted with mathematical tools such as Smirnov's fermionic observables, transfer matrices, and spectral radii. Quantum walks and the six-vertex model arise as the next step in this direction.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on quantum complexity of time-dependent oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work had shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It provides a proof of concept for the application of Nielsen complexity in cosmology, together with a systematic setting in which higher-order terms can be included.</description>

      <title>A Max-Flow approach to Random Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a random tensor network (RTN) using tools from free probability theory. Random tensor networks are simple toy models that help the understanding of the entanglement behavior of a boundary region in the ADS/CFT context. One can think of random tensor networks are specific probabilistic models for tensors having some particular geometry dictated by a graph (or network) structure. We first introduce our model of RTN, obtained by contracting maximally entangled states (corresponding to the edges of the graph) on the tensor product of Gaussian tensors (corresponding to the vertices of the graph). We study the entanglement spectrum of the resulting random spectrum along a given bipartition of the local Hilbert spaces. We provide the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density operator of the RTN state, in the limit of large local dimension. The limit value is described via a maximum flow optimization problem in a new graph corresponding to the geometry of the RTN and the given bipartition. In the case of series-parallel graphs, we provide an explicit formula for the limiting eigenvalue distribution using classical and free multiplicative convolutions. We discuss the physical implications of our results, allowing us to go beyond the semiclassical regime without any cut assumption, specifically in terms of finite corrections to the average entanglement entropy of the RTN.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the ALAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory (QFT). The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>A new heuristic approach for contextuality degree estimates and its four- to six-qubit portrayals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe a new heuristic method for finding an upper bound on the degree of contextuality and the corresponding unsatisfied part of a quantum contextual configuration with three-element contexts (i.e., lines) located in a multi-qubit symplectic polar space of order two. While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The four-qubit unsatisfied configurations we found are quite remarkable. That of an elliptic quadric features 315 lines and has in its core three copies of the split Cayley hexagon of order two having a Heawood-graph-underpinned geometry in common. That of a hyperbolic quadric also has 315 lines but, as a point-line incidence structure, is isomorphic to the dual $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ of $\mathcal{W}(5,2)$. Finally, an unsatisfied configuration with 1575 lines associated with all the lines/contexts of the four-qubit space contains a distinguished $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ centered on a point-plane incidence graph of PG$(3,2)$. The corresponding configurations found in the five-qubit space exhibit a considerably higher degree of complexity, except for a hyperbolic quadric, whose 6975 unsatisfied contexts are compactified around the point-hyperplane incidence graph of PG$(4,2)$. The most remarkable unsatisfied patterns discovered in the six-qubit space are a couple of disjoint split Cayley hexagons (for the full space) and a subgeometry underpinned by the complete bipartite graph $K_{7,7}$ (for a hyperbolic quadric).</description>

Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.</description>

      <title>Born statistics for quantum mechanical measurements from random walk potentials?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the Schrodinger equation can predict Born statistics for evolution to eigenstates when a potential energy causes the quantum system to undergo a random walk. Specifically, we show how the random walk results in a quantum state during a measurement evolving arbitrarily close to eigenstates with the expected Born probabilities. The random walk is described in terms of the time-dependent unitary matrix U(t) that has a one-to-one equivalence to the external potential in Schrodinger's equation. Assuming the analysis is correct, some interesting questions arise. Are any measurements described by such physics? Can a measurement apparatus be designed that results in measurement statistics that deviate from Born statistics while still being a reliable measurement? For quantum information systems, are there implications for qubit noise and algorithm design? This is a draft of a work in progress, and respectful questions, comments, suggestions, or interest in informal or formal collaboration are welcome.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity and Horizons: A New Approach to Fluxes and Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework tailored to degrees of freedom (DOF) of field theories that reside in suitable 3-dimensional open regions, and then apply it to the gravitational DOF of general relativity. Specifically, these DOF now refer to open regions of null infinity, and of black hole (and cosmological) horizons representing equilibrium situations. At null infinity the new Hamiltonian framework yields the well-known BMS fluxes and charges. By contrast, all fluxes vanish identically at black hole (and cosmological) horizons just as one would physically expect. In a companion paper we showed that, somewhat surprisingly, the geometry and symmetries of these two physical configurations descend from a common framework. This paper reinforces that theme: Very different physics emerges in the two cases from a common Hamiltonian framework because of the difference in the nature of degrees of freedom. Finally, we compare and contrast this Hamiltonian approach with those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>

Abstract: We introduce generalization of famous Macdonald polynomials for the case of super-Young diagrams that contain half-boxes on the equal footing with full boxes. These super-Macdonald polynomials are polynomials of extended set of variables: usual $p_k$ variables are accompanied by anti-commuting Grassmann variables $\theta_k$. Starting from recently defined super-Schur polynomials and exploiting orthogonality relations with triangular decompositions we are able to fully determine super-Macdonald polynomials. These new polynomials have similar properties to canonical Macdonald polynomials -- they respect two different orderings in the set of (super)-Young diagrams simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Revisiting the results by Winternitz [Symmetry in physics, CRM Proc. Lecture Notes 34, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, pp. 215-227], we thoroughly refine his classification of Lie subalgebras of the real order-three special linear Lie algebra and thus present the correct version of this classification for the first time. A similar classification over the complex numbers is also carried out. We follow the general approach by Patera, Winternitz and Zassenhaus but in addition enhance it and rigorously prove its theoretical basis for the required specific cases of classifying subalgebras of real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we first construct complete lists of inequivalent subalgebras of the rank-two affine Lie algebra over both the real and complex fields.</description>

While the ground state problem (i.e., the free energy at temperature $T = 0$) for these systems is expected to be computationally hard even for quantum computers, our algorithm runs for any fixed temperature $T &gt; 0$ in subpolynomial time, i.e., in time $O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{c})$ for any constant $c &gt; 0$ where $\varepsilon$ is the additive approximation error. Previously, the best known algorithm had a runtime that is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$. Our algorithm is also particularly simple as it reduces to the computation of the spectral radius of a linear map. This linear map has an interpretation as a noncommutative transfer matrix and has been studied previously to prove results on the analyticity of the free energy and the decay of correlations. We also show that the corresponding eigenvector of this map gives an approximation of the marginal of the Gibbs state and thereby allows for the computation of various thermodynamic properties of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of Wiedemann-Franz law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Generalizing Unique Decompositions of Generators of Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the result of Gorini, Kossakowski, and Sudarshan [J. Math. Phys. 17:821, 1976] that every generator of a quantum-dynamical semigroup decomposes uniquely into a closed and a dissipative part, assuming the trace of both vanishes. More precisely, we show that given any generator $L$ of a completely positive dynamical semigroup and any matrix $B$ there exists a unique matrix $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ has trace zero, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. The key to proving this is the relation between the trace of a completely positive map, the trace of its Kraus operators, and expectation values of its Choi matrix. Moreover, we show that the above decomposition is orthogonal with respect to some $B$-weighted inner product.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric and Positivity Preserving Formulation of a Spectral Method for Vlasov-Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the anti-symmetric properties of a spectral discretization for the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. The discretization is based on a spectral expansion in velocity with the symmetrically weighted Hermite basis functions, central finite differencing in space, and an implicit Runge Kutta integrator in time. The proposed discretization preserves the anti-symmetric structure of the advection operator in the Vlasov equation, resulting in a stable numerical method. We apply such discretization to two formulations: the canonical Vlasov-Poisson equations and their continuously transformed square-root representation. The latter preserves the positivity of the particle distribution function. We derive analytically the conservation properties of both formulations, including particle number, momentum, and energy, which are verified numerically on the following benchmark problems: manufactured solution, linear and nonlinear Landau damping, two-stream instability, bump-on-tail instability, and ion-acoustic wave.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>

      <title>The symplectic form associated to a singular Poisson algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an affine Poisson algebra, that is singular one may ask whether there is an associated symplectic form. In the smooth case the answer is obvious: for the symplectic form to exist the Poisson tensor has to be invertible. In the singular case, however, derivations do not form a projective module and the nondegeneracy condition is more subtle. For a symplectic singularity one may naively ask if there is indeed an analogue of a symplectic form. We examine an example of a symplectic singularity, namely the double cone, and show that here such a symplectic form exists. We use the naive de Rham complex of a Lie-Rinehart algebra. Our analysis of the double cone uses Gr\"obner bases calculations. We also give an alternative construction of the symplectic form that generalizes to categorical quotients of cotangent lifted representations of finite groups. We use the same formulas to construct a symplectic form on the simple cone, seen as a Poisson differential space and generalize the construction to linear symplectic orbifolds. We present useful auxiliary results that enable to explicitly determine generators for the module of derivations an affine variety. The latter may be understood as a differential space.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Waves from Finite Sources Arranged in Line Segments within an Infinite Triangular Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the propagation of time-harmonic waves in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant $a = 1$. The sources are positioned along line segments within the lattice. Specifically, we investigate the discrete Helmholtz equation with a wavenumber $k \in \left( 0,2\sqrt{2} \right)$, where input data is prescribed on finite rows or columns of lattice sites. We focus on two main questions: the efficacy of the numerical methods employed in evaluating the Green's function, and the necessity of the cone condition. Consistent with a continuum theory, we employ the notion of radiating solution and establish a unique solvability result and Green's representation formula using difference potentials. Finally, we propose a numerical computation method and demonstrate its efficiency through examples related to the propagation problems in the left-handed two-dimensional inductor-capacitor metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>
