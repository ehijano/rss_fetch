      <title>The Use of Wigner Expansion and Path Integral Method for Quantum Correction of the Low-Order Spectral Moments and Collision-Induced Absorption Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims at examination of the lower-order spectral moments in collision-induced absorption (CIA), taking the translational He-Ar band as an example. General quantum corrections for the zeroth and first spectral moments are derived on the basis of the Wigner expansion up to the order of $\hbar^8$ and $\hbar^{10}$, respectively. These corrections were then explored for numerical simulation of the He-Ar moments over the temperature range 50-500 K. The accuracy of the obtained temperature dependencies is validated through the comparison with direct quantum solution of the scattering and bound-state problems as well as with the results obtained using the path integral (PI) approach. Quite satisfactory agreement was achieved as a result of the application of the two independent ways of approximate accounting for the quantum nature of absorption. The robustness of the Wigner expansion and PI corrections was thus demonstrated, both of which can be used to obviate direct quantum simulation of the CIA spectral moments. The approximate method is suggested for an accurate simulation of the CIA spectral profile on the basis of the obtained quantum-corrected moments and the classical trajectory-based formalism.</description>

      <title>First-Order Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory with Double Exchange for Multireference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend first-order multiconfigurational symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, SAPT(MC), [Hapka M. et al. JCTC, 2021, 17], to account for double-exchange effects, where up to two electron pairs are exchanged between interacting monomers. To achieve this, we derive density-matrix-based expressions for the first-order exchange energy to arbitrary orders in the overlap expansion. As a numerical demonstration, we apply the double-exchange approximation to strongly orthogonal geminal wave functions. Additionally, we propose an approximate method for evaluating double-exchange energy with complete active space (CAS) wave functions of the valence type, i.e., with n active electrons distributed over n orbitals. We analyze the performance of these methods on model dimers in both ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>A new thermodynamic function for binary mixtures: the co-molar volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new theory relating partial molar volumes of binary mixtures to the specific (Voronoi) volumes. A simple relation gives new insight into the physical meaning of partial molar volumes in terms of the actual volumes occupied by the molecules. Partial molar quantities are defined through the use of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. These properties have been in use for a long time, despite the fact that they do not give an intuitive picture of the properties they are to represent. For instance, the partial molar volume of a given component in a mixture is the change in the total volume with a change in composition, hence it represents the derivative of a volume. The molar volume is a measurable property in the laboratory, and as such a body of thermodynamics, but the derived partial molar volume is not a direct measure of the physical volume occupied by the added component. On the other hand, the physical volume can be computed using e.g. molecular dynamics simulations by Voronoi tesselation. We shall call this volume the specific volume. To bridge the partial molar volume and the specific volume, we define a single new thermodynamic variable - the co-molar volume - thus bringing the latter into thermodynamics. We demonstrate this bridge through molecular dynamics simulations. The co-molar volume is closely related to the co-moving velocity defined in immiscible two-phase flow in porous media.</description>

      <title>Laser-Synthesized Ligand-Free Cu Nanocatalysts in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) represents a pivotal strategy for mitigating global carbon emissions while simultaneously converting renewable energy into storable chemical fuels. Copper-based catalysts have been extensively explored in this field due to their unique capability to catalyze multi-carbon products. However, the intrinsic complexity of eCO2R pathways on Cu surfaces often leads to mixed product distributions, posing a significant challenge for achieving high selectivity toward a single desired hydrocarbon. Herein, we report a breakthrough in methane selectivity using laser-synthesized, ligand-free Cu nanomaterials. Unlike conventional Cu catalysts that produce diverse products, these ligand-free nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented selectivity for methane (CH4) with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70% at superior overpotentials. The absence of surface ligands, a direct consequence of the ultrafast laser ablation synthesis, ensures abundant exposed active sites with tailored electronic and geometric configurations. We attribute the exceptional methane selectivity to the synergistic effects of active sites-rich surfaces and optimized *CO intermediate binding energetics, which favor the protonation pathway toward CH4 rather than C-C coupling. This work not only resolves the long-standing selectivity dilemma in Cu-catalyzed eCO2R but also establishes laser-synthesized ligand-free nanomaterials as a versatile platform for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Static linear density response from X-ray Thomson scattering measurements: a case study of warm dense beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear response theory is ubiquitous throughout physics and plays a central role in the theoretical description of warm dense matter -- an extreme state that occurs within compact astrophysical objects and that is traversed on the compression path of a fuel capsule in inertial confinement fusion applications. Here we show how one can relate the static linear density response function to X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements, which opens up new possibilities for the diagnostics of extreme states of matter, and for the rigorous assessment and verification of theoretical models and approximations. As a practical example, we consider an XRTS data set of warm dense beryllium taken at the National Ignition Facility [T.~D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. The comparison with state-of-the-art \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature Commun.}~(in print), arXiv:2402.19113] gives us a best estimate of the mass density of $\rho=18\pm6\,$g/cc, which is consistent with previous PIMC and density functional theory based studies, but rules out the original estimate of $\rho=34\pm4\,$g/cc based on a Chihara model fit.</description>

      <title>Laboratory rotational spectra of cyanocyclohexane and its siblings (1- and 4-cyanocyclohexene) using a compact CP-FTMW spectrometer for interstellar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to record broadband gas-phase rotational spectra, enabling detailed investigations of molecular structure, dynamics, and hyperfine interactions. Here, we present the development and application of a CP-FTMW spectrometer operating in the 6.5-18 GHz frequency range, studying cyanocyclohexane, 1-cyanocyclohexene, and 4-cyanocyclohexene using a heated pulsed supersonic expansion source. The dynamic range, experimental resolution, and high sensitivity enable observation of multiple conformers, precise measurements of hyperfine splitting arising from nuclear quadrupole coupling due to the nitrogen atom in the cyano group, as well as the observation of singly $^{13}$C- and $^{15}$N-substituted isotopic isomers in natural abundance. Using the latter, precise structures for the molecules are derived. The accurate rotational spectra enabled a search for these species toward the dark, cold molecular cloud TMC-1; no signals are found, and we discuss the implications of derived upper limits on the interstellar chemistry of the cyanocyclohexane family.</description>

      <title>Generating new coordination compounds via multireference simulations, genetic algorithms and machine learning: the case of Co(II) molecular magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches</description>

      <title>Force switching and potential shifting lead to significant cutoff dependence in alchemical free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of long-range energy terms such as van der Waals interactions is crucial for reliable free energy calculations in molecular simulations. Methods like force switching, potential switching, potential shifting, and Ewald summation of van der Waals are commonly employed to smooth the truncation or otherwise manage these interactions at and beyond a cutoff distance, but their effects on free energy calculations are not always clear. In this study, we systematically explore the effects of these modifiers on the accuracy of free energy calculations using model systems: Lennard-Jones spheres, all-atom anthracene in water with GROMACS, and alkane chains in water with LAMMPS. Our results reveal that free energies of solvation using potential switching and particle-mesh Ewald summation of long-range Lennard-Jones are essentially independent of cutoff in solution, while force switching and potential shifting introduce cutoff-dependent behavior significant enough to affect the utility of the calculations.</description>

      <title>Chemically Motivated Simulation Problems are Efficiently Solvable by a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially with the size of the system. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck , thanks to their capability of representing this amount of information efficiently. Most efforts so far have been centered around determining the ground states of chemical systems. However, hardness results and the lack of theoretical guarantees for efficient heuristics for initial-state generation shed doubt on the feasibility. Here, we propose a heuristically guided approach that is based on inherently efficient routines to solve chemical simulation problems, requiring quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states for dynamics simulation by assembling them in a scattering tree. In particular, we investigate a scattering-based state preparation approach within the context of mergo-association. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured after the quantum simulation of a process, e.g., a reaction, following its corresponding initial state preparation.</description>

      <title>E(3)-equivariant models cannot learn chirality: Field-based molecular generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</description>

      <title>Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</description>
