      <title>Elliptic and quadrangular flow of protons in the high baryon density region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective flow is crucial for understanding the anisotropic expansion of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the equation of state of nuclear matter in high baryon density regions. In this paper, we use the hadronic transport model SMASH to study the elliptic flow ($v_2$), quadrangular flow ($v_4$), and their ratio ($v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$) in Au+Au collisions at high baryon density. Our results show that the inclusion of baryonic mean-field potential in the model successfully reproduces experimental data from the HADES experiment, indicating that baryonic interactions play an important role in shaping anisotropic flow. In addition to comparing the transverse momentum ($p_T$), rapidity, and centrality dependence of $v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$ between HADES data and model calculations, we also explore its time evolution and energy dependence from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 2.4 to 4.5 GeV. We find that the ratio $v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$ is close to 0.5, as expected from hydrodynamic behavior. These results suggest that the early-stage evolution in the high baryon density region resembles ideal fluid behavior.</description>

      <title>Imprints of high-density nuclear symmetry energy on the crustal fraction of neutron star moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ remains the most uncertain aspect of the equation of state (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. Implications of observational crustal fraction of neutron star (NS) moment of inertia $\Delta I/I$ on the $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ are examined in the present work, utilizing an isospin-dependent parameterization of NS EOS. We find that symmetry energy parameters significantly influence the $\Delta I/I$, while the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter has a negligible effect. An increase in the slope $L$ and skewness $J_{\rm sym}$ of symmetry energy results in a larger $\Delta I/I$, whereas an increase in the curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ leads to a reduction in $\Delta I/I$. Additionally, we discuss the imprints of observational $\Delta I/I$ on the symmetry energy for NSs with masses of 1.0 M$_\odot$ or 1.4 M$_\odot$. Our results indicate that the $\Delta I/I$ has the potential to set a lower limit of symmetry energy at densities exceeding $3\rho_0$, particularly when $L$ is constrained to values less than $60$ MeV, thereby enhancing our understanding of supradense NS matter.</description>

      <title>Divergence and resummation of the moment expansion for an ultrarelativistic gas in Bjorken flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time that the moment expansion for an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing Bjorken flow diverges. We then show how this series can be resummed using the Borel-Pad\'e method and use this to determine the single-particle distribution function of the gas. Finally, we compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Finite nuclei in an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical framework to investigate the properties of finite nuclei based on an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (eNJL) model, where the Dirac sea, the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and the quark degrees of freedom are considered by extending the SU(3) NJL model and treating baryons as clusters of quarks. The eNJL model can then be readily adopted to examine the matter states ranging from baryonic matter to quark matter in a unified manner. In this work, by assuming spherically symmetric finite nuclei and neglecting the center-of-mass or rotational corrections, we systematically investigate the properties of finite nuclei based on the eNJL model with additional pairing correlations. It is found that our model generally reproduces the binding energies of the 2495 nuclei ($A&gt;2$) from the 2016 Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2016) with the root-mean-square deviations $5.38$ MeV. The deviations are mainly attributed to the too large shell gaps at magic numbers $N(Z) =28$, 50, and 82 as well as the spurious shell closures at $N(Z)=34$, 58, and 92. Meanwhile, the obtained charge radii of 906 nuclei are systematically smaller than the experimental values with root-mean-square deviations $0.127$ fm. In our future study, we expect to reduce the uncertainties of our predictions by carefully calibrating the density dependence of coupling constants and considering deformations with microscopic collective corrections from the nucleons in the Fermi sea and quarks in the Dirac sea.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure and the equation of state through pre-equilibrium dipole emission in charge-asymmetric reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pre-equilibrium dipole response in the charge-asymmetric reaction $^{40}$Ca+$^{152}$Sm, of recent experimental interest, at several beam energies within the range $[5, 11]$ AMeV and different collision centralities. By employing Skyrme-like effective interactions for the nuclear mean field, we probe the role of the different ingredients performing theoretical calculations based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach or a semi-classical transport model that also includes two-body correlations. A comparative analysis between these approaches allowed us to disentangle the role of deformation effects in the entrance channel from the ones associated with structure details of genuine quantal nature on the dipole emission. Moreover, we also investigate the impact of the occurrence of residual two-body collisions on the reaction dynamics. This study contributes to the understanding of the microscopic processes that determine the complex dynamics of low-energy heavy-ion collisions along the fusion-fission path, which is relevant to super-heavy element synthesis, unraveling interesting connections with the characteristics of the nuclear effective interaction and the associated equation of state.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on nuclear EOSs and coupling constants in RMF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing various astrophysical constraints on neutron star structures, we carry out a Bayesian analysis on the density-dependent behaviors of coupling constants in RMF models as well as the nuclear matter properties at supranuclear densities. The effective nucleon interactions in the isoscalar-scalar, isoscalar-vector, and isovector-vector channels are considered, where the corresponding coupling constants ($\alpha_S, \alpha_V, \alpha_{TV}$) are fixed by dividing entire density range into three regions with six independent parameters. In this work we focus on constraining the density-dependent point-coupling constants at supranuclear densities, while the coupling constants at subsaturation densities are derived from the covariant density functional DD-ME2. For those consistent with astrophysical observations, the coupling constants generally decrease with density and approach to small positive values at large enough densities, which qualitatively agrees with various RMF models. The posterior probability density functions and their correlations of the coupling constants and various nuclear matter properties are examined as well. At $1\sigma$ level, the constrained coupling constants at density $1.5n_0$ ($2.5n_0$) are $\alpha_S = 3.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05} (1.55^{+0.85}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$, $\alpha_V = 2.3^{+0.1}_{-0.0} (1.3^{+0.55}_{-0.1}) \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$, and $\alpha_{TV} = 2.05^{+0}_{-0.4} (2.05^{+0}_{-0.5})\times 10^{-5} \mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$. At larger densities, we find the lower limit of $\alpha_{TV}$ is not well constrained, so that more extensive calculations with larger number of free parameters are necessary.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine correction to H, D, and $^3$He energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete second-order hyperfine-interaction correction is calculated for centroid energy levels of H, D, and $^3$He atoms. For $^3$He, the corrections of $-2.075$ kHz and $-0.305$ kHz beyond the leading hyperfine-mixing contribution are obtained for the $2^1S$ and $2^3S$ states, respectively. These results shift the nuclear charge radii difference derived from the $^3$He - $^4$He isotope shift and largely resolve the previously reported disagreement between the muonic and electronic helium determinations [Y. van der Werf et al., arXiv:2306.02333 (2023); K. Schuhmann et al., arXiv:2305.11679 (2023)].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently formulated extension of perfect spin hydrodynamics, which includes second-order corrections in the spin polarization tensor to the energy-momentum tensor and baryon current, is studied in the case of a one-dimensional boost-invariant expansion. The presence of second-order corrections introduces feedback from spin dynamics on the hydrodynamic background, constraining possible spin polarization configurations. However, as long as the magnitude of the spin polarization tensor remains small (below unity in natural units), the permitted spin dynamics differs very little from that found in the case without the second-order corrections.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on pseudo-gauge transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical pseudo-gauge transformations are discussed in the context of hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. A decomposition of the pseudo-gauge transformation into Lorentz-invariant tensors is made, which allows for better interpretation of its physical consequences. For pseudo-gauge transformations connecting two symmetric energy-momentum tensors, we find that the super-potential $\Phi^{\lambda, \mu \nu}$ must obey a conservation law of the form $\partial_\lambda \Phi^{\lambda, \mu \nu} = 0$. This equation, referred to below as the STS condition, represents a constraint that is hardly possible to be satisfied for tensors constructed out of the basic hydrodynamic variables such as temperature, baryon chemical potential, and the hydrodynamic flow. However, in a special case of the boost-invariant flow, the STS condition is automatically fulfilled and a non-trivial residual pseudo-gauge transformation defined by a single scalar field is allowed. In this case the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients become pseudo-gauge dependent; however, their specific linear combination appearing in the equations of motion remains pseudo-gauge invariant. This finding provides new insights into the role of pseudo-gauge transformations and pseudo-gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides using the Canadian Penning Trap to inform predictions in the $r$-process rare-earth peak region probe the $r$-process rare-earth peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies aiming to determine the astrophysical origins of nuclei produced by the rapid neutron capture process ($r$ process) rely on nuclear properties as inputs for simulations. The solar abundances can be used as a benchmark for such calculations, with the $r$-process rare-earth peak (REP) around mass number ($A$) $164$ being of special interest due to its presently unknown origin. With the advancement of rare isotope beam production over the last decade and improvement in experimental sensitivities, many of these REP nuclides have become accessible for measurement. Masses are one of the most critical inputs as they impact multiple nuclear properties, namely the neutron-separation energies, neutron capture rates, $\beta$-decay rates, and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities. In this work, we report masses of 20 neutron-rich nuclides (along the Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Gd, Dy and Ho isotopic chains) produced at the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The masses were measured with the Canadian Penning trap (CPT) mass spectrometer using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) technique. We then use these new masses along with previously published CPT masses to inform predictions for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure aiming to identify the astrophysical conditions consistent with both solar data and mass measurements. We show that the MCMC responds to this updated mass information, producing refined results for both mass predictions and REP abundances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charmonia suppression has been considered as a smoking gun signature of quark-gluon plasma. However, the Large Hadron Collider has observed a lower degree of suppression as compared to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energies, due to regeneration effects in heavy-ion collisions. Though proton collisions are considered to be the baseline measurements to characterize a hot and dense medium formation in heavy-ion collisions, LHC proton collisions with its new physics of heavy-ion-like QGP signatures have created new challenges. To understand this, the inclusive charmonia production at the forward rapidities in the dimuon channel is compared with the corresponding measurements in the dielectron channel at the midrapidity as a function of final state charged particle multiplicity. None of the theoretical models quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings leaving out a lot of room for theory. To circumvent this and find a reasonable understanding, we use machine learning tools to separate prompt and nonprompt charmonia and open charm mesons using the decay daughter track properties and the decay topologies of the mother particles. Using PYTHIA8 data, we train the machine learning models and successfully separate prompt and nonprompt charm hadrons from the inclusive sample to study various directions of their production dynamics. This study enables a domain of using machine learning techniques, which can be used in the experimental analysis to better understand charm hadron production and build possible theoretical understanding.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Protocol to Solve the Nuclear Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model describes very accurately the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with respect to the number of degrees of freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we investigate the implementation of a quantum annealing protocol for nuclear ground states. We propose a driver Hamiltonian with sufficiently large gaps, and validate our approach in nuclei with up to 28 nucleons employing classical simulations of the annealing evolution using a digitalized Trotter decomposition. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current annealing setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the number of elements of the many-body basis.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy of optimized proton-neutron pair condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton-neutron pairing and like-nucleon pairing are two different facets of atomic nuclear configurations. While like-nucleon pair condensates manifest their superfluidic nature in semi magic nuclei, it is not absolutely clear if there exists a T=0 proton-neutron pair condensate phase in $N=Z$ nuclei. With an explicit formalism of general pair condensates with good particle numbers, we optimize proton-neutron pair condensates for all $N=Z$ nuclei between $^{16}$O and $^{100}$Sn, given shell model effective interactions. As comparison, we also optimize like-nucleon pair condensates for their semi-magic isotones. Shannon entanglement entropy is a measurement of mixing among pair configurations, and can signal intrinsic phase transition. It turns out the like-nucleon pair condensates for semi-magic nuclei have large entropies signaling an entangled phase, but the proton-neutron pair condensates end up not far from a Hartree-Fock solution, with small entropy. With artificial pairing interaction strengths, we show that the general proton-neutron pair condensate can transit from an entangled T=1 phase to an entangled T=0 phase, i.e. pairing phase transition driven by external parameters. In the T=0 limit, the proton-neutron pair condensate optimized for $^{24}$Mg turns out to be a purely P pair condensate with large entanglement entropy, although such cases may occur in cold atom systems, unlikely in atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Re-investigation of the interplay of fission modes and non-equilibrium fission processes in heavy actinide nuclei 249Bk and 257Md</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of mass and angular distributions of fission fragments from actinide nuclei 249Bk and 257Md, produced in fusion reactions 11B and 19F + 238238U, are presented. Experimentally observed mass ratio distributions indicate 'multi-chance fission' through the interplay of fission modes in the fission process, and they agree well with predictions from calculations using the GEF ('GEneral description of Fission observables') model code. Furthermore, to test the signatures of events from non-compound nuclear processes in the fission of 249Bk and 257Md nuclei, Monte Carlo statistical decay model calculations using GEMINI++ were performed for the measured mass distribution at all energies. For comparison purposes, the fission fragment mass distributions of neighboring heavy actinide nuclei, previously measured in the fission of 250Cf and 254Fm nuclei produced by 12C and 16O projectiles on a 238U target, are also presented. The measured angular anisotropy data for the 19F + 238U reaction differ from the results of the Transition State Model at energies below the fusion barrier. As a result of the present study, we suggest considering the interplay between K relaxation time, dynamic dissipation, and their influence on shell correction to understand the evolution of fission dynamics in heavy-ion-induced actinide nuclei</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04736v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dipole toroidal modes appear in many fields of physics. In nuclei, such a mode was predicted more than 50 years ago, but clear experimental evidence was lacking so far. Using a combination of high-resolution inelastic scattering experiments with photons, electrons and protons, we identify for the first time candidates for toroidal dipole excitations in the nucleus $^{58}$Ni and demonstrate that transverse electron scattering form factors represent a relevant experimental observable to prove their nature.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine our previous calculation of multipole amplitude $E_{0+}$ for pion photoproduction process, $\gamma N\rightarrow\pi N$. The treatment of final-state interactions is based upon an earlier analysis of pion-nucleon scattering within Hamiltonian effective field theory, supplemented by incorporating contributions from the $N^*(1650)$ and the $K\Lambda$ coupled channel. The contribution from the bare state corresponding to the $N^*(1650)$ significantly enhances our results. Additionally, we also compute the multipole amplitude $M_{1-}$, which is of direct relevance to the Roper resonance. The results are comparable with other dynamical coupled channel models, even though the contribution from the bare state (interpreted as a 2$s$ excitation) in this channel is small because of its large mass.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of the pion DF and proton spin developments are sketched herein, along with some novel perspectives on gluon and quark orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Formation, dissociation and regeneration of charmonia within microscopic Langevin simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic dynamical model to study the formation, dissociation, and recombination processes of charmonium states in a heat bath at constant temperature and volume. Within this classical approach, heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents and can therefore be modeled by a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then implemented through relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential to form a bound state if the relative energy of the pair becomes negative. Dissociation of bound states is possible as a result of screening effects on the potential as well as through scatterings with plasma particles. We demonstrate the full equilibration of the system and show that the resulting equilibrium charmonium yields are in accordance with the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>
