      <title>A Layered Protocol Architecture for the Internet of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements and the ability to learn domain-specific languages (DSLs), including APIs and tool interfaces. This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The "Internet of Agents" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.
  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Field Test of 5G New Radio (NR) UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD Live-Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of User-Generated Content (UGC), especially High-Definition (HD) live video streaming, places a significant demand on the uplink capabilities of mobile networks. To address this, the 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduced key uplink enhancements, including Uplink Multi-Input Multi-Output (UL-MIMO) and Uplink 256QAM, to improve throughput and spectral efficiency. However, while the benefits of these features for raw data rates are well-documented, their practical impact on real-time applications like live-streaming is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). To ensure a fair assessment, we conduct a comparative analysis by modifying the modem firmware of commercial User Equipment (UE), allowing these features to be selectively enabled and disabled on the same device. Performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including dropped video frames and connection stability. Furthermore, this study analyzes 5G Radio Frequency (RF) parameters to quantify the spectral efficiency impact, specifically examining metrics derived from the Channel State Information (CSI) framework, including Reference Signal Received Power (CSI-RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ), and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CSI-SINR).</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Uplink 256QAM on Commercial 5G New Radio (NR) Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Uplink 256QAM (UL-256QAM) has been introduced since 2016 as a part of 3GPP Release 14, the adoption was quite poor as many Radio Access Network (RAN) and User Equipment (UE) vendors didn't support this feature. With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.
  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evaluations of High Power User Equipment (HPUE) in Urban Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Time Division Duplexing (TDD) 5G New Radio (NR) networks offers higher downlink throughput due to the utilization of the middle frequency band, the uplink performance is negatively impacted due to higher path loss associated with higher frequencies, which degrade the users QoE in less optimal conditions. With the growing demand for high performance uplink throughput from novel applications such as Metaverse, Internet of Things (IoTs) and Smart City, 3GPP introduced High Power User Equipment (HPUE) on 5G TDD bands, allowing UEs to utilize more than 23 dBm of power for transmission to improve throughput, QoE, and reliability, especially at the cell edges. In this paper, the performance of HPUE is evaluated in the urban area on a commercial 5G network in terms of Uplink Throughput, Modulation Efficiency, Re-transmission Rate (ReTx Rate), and Power Consumption in both Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) modes. Through modem firmware modification, the performance is also compared across different power classes and antenna configurations.</description>

      <title>POMDP-Based Routing for DTNs with Partial Knowledge and Dependent Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) is inherently challenging due to sparse connectivity, long delays, and frequent disruptions. While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to model uncertainty, they assume full state observability - an assumption that breaks down in partitioned DTNs, where each node operates with inherently partial knowledge of the network state. In this work, we investigate the role of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for DTN routing under uncertainty. We introduce and evaluate a novel model: Dependent Node Failures (DNF), which captures correlated node failures via repairable node states modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We implement the model using JuliaPOMDP and integrate it with DTN simulations via DtnSim. Our evaluation demonstrates that POMDP-based routing yields improved delivery ratios and delay performance under uncertain conditions while maintaining scalability. These results highlight the potential of POMDPs as a principled foundation for decision-making in future DTN deployments.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems: GNN-Enabled Optimization Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA) system (PASS) for multi-user downlink information transmission, motivated by the unknown impact of the integration of emerging PASS and RIS on wireless communications. First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Improving the Identification of Real-world Malware's DNS Covert Channels Using Locality Sensitive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, malware increasingly uses DNS-based covert channels in order to evade detection and maintain stealthy communication with its command-and-control servers. While prior work has focused on detecting such activity, identifying specific malware families and their behaviors from captured network traffic remains challenging due to the variability of DNS. In this paper, we present the first application of Locality Sensitive Hashing to the detection and identification of real-world malware utilizing DNS covert channels. Our approach encodes DNS subdomain sequences into statistical similarity features that effectively capture anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Combined with a Random Forest classifier, our method achieves higher accuracy and reduced false positive rates than prior approaches, while demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to previously unseen or modified malware samples. We further demonstrate that our approach enables reliable classification of malware behavior (e.g., uploading or downloading of files), based solely on DNS subdomains.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Performance Potential of Mega-Constellation Networks: An Exploration of Structure-Building Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mega-constellation networks (MCNs) are transforming global internet access by providing ubiquitous connectivity to millions of users worldwide.
  The design of MCNs is crucial for achieving high-performance space-based internet, yet presents a significant challenge due to the large scale and tightly coupled parameters of these systems, which result in a high-dimensional combinatorial optimization problem. To address this challenge, we propose the Structured Motif Lattice (SML) paradigm, which decomposes the MCN design space into two orthogonal dimensions: topological connectivity and geometric layout. This decomposition reduces the original high-dimensional problem to a tractable bi-dimensional.
  Under the SML paradigm, we formalize the High-Availability and Low-Latency MCN Design (HALLMD) problem and develop the Lattice and Motif Search (LAMS) algorithm to find near-optimal MCN configurations.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LAMS under the SML paradigm achieves substantially higher network availability and lower average traffic latency than the structures generated by current state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models for Simultaneous Generation of Multi-scale Mobile Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planning, management, and resource scheduling of cellular mobile networks require joint estimation of mobile traffic across different layers and nodes. Mobile traffic generation can proactively anticipate user demands and capture the dynamics of network load. However, existing methods mainly focus on generating traffic at a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to jointly model multi-scale traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based model for multi-scale mobile traffic generation. ZoomDiff maps urban environmental context into mobile traffic with multiple spatial and temporal resolutions through a set of customized Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising mechanism, enabling different stages to generate traffic at distinct spatiotemporal resolutions. This design aligns the progressive denoising process with hierarchical network layers, including base stations, cells, and grids of varying granularities. Experiments on real-world mobile traffic datasets show that ZoomDiff achieves at least an 18.4% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-scale traffic generation tasks. Moreover, ZoomDiff demonstrates strong efficiency and cross-city generalization, highlighting its potential as a powerful generative framework for modeling multi-scale mobile network dynamics.</description>
