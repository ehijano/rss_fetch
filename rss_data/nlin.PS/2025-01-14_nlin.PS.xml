      <title>Oscillations of Solitonic Galactic Cores in Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Interaction of upper hybrid waves with dust-ion-magnetoacoustic waves and stable two-dimensional solitons in dusty plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a two-dimensional nonlinear system of equations for the electrostatic potential envelope and the low-frequency magnetic field perturbation to describe the interaction of the upper hybrid wave propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic field with the dust-ion-magnetoacoustic (DIMA) wave in a magnetized dusty plasma. The equations contain both scalar and vector nonlinearities. A nonlinear dispersion relation is derived and the decay and modulation instability thresholds and growth rates are obtained. Numerical estimates show that instability thresholds can easily be exceeded in real dusty plasmas. In the static (subsonic) approximation, a two-dimensional (2D) soliton solution (ground state) is found numerically by the generalized Petviashvili relaxation method. The perturbations of the magnetic field and plasma density in the soliton are nonmonotonic in space and, along with the perturbation in the form of a well, there are also perturbation humps. Such peculiar radial soliton profiles differ significantly from previously known results on 2D solitons. The key point is that the presence of a gap in the DIMA wave dispersion due to the Rao cutoff frequency causes the nonlinearity to be nonlocal. We show that due to nonlocal nonlinearity the Hamiltonian is bounded below at fixed energy, proving the stability of the ground state.</description>

      <title>Applied Probability Insights into Nonlinear Epidemic Dynamics with Independent Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of a stochastic SAIRS-type epidemic model that explicitly incorporates the roles of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in disease transmission dynamics. Asymptomatic carriers, often undetected due to the lack of symptoms, play a crucial role in the spread of many communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Our model also accounts for vaccination and considers the stochastic effects of environmental and population-level randomness using L\'evy processes. We begin by demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the proposed stochastic system, ensuring the model's mathematical validity. Subsequently, we derive sufficient conditions under which the disease either becomes extinct or persists over time, depending on the parameters and initial conditions. The analysis highlights the influence of random perturbations, asymptomatic transmission, and vaccination strategies on disease dynamics. Finally, we conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings and illustrate the behavior of the model under various scenarios of randomness and parameter settings. These results provide valuable insights into the stochastic dynamics of epidemic outbreaks and inform strategies for disease management and control.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of uniform and oscillatory states resulting from nonreciprocity and conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing a two-species Cahn-Hilliard model with nonreciprocal interactions we show that the interplay of nonreciprocity and conservation laws results in the robust coexistence of uniform stationary and oscillatory phases as well as of uniform and crystalline phases. For nonequilibrium models with a spurious gradient dynamics structure such coexistencies between two or more nonequilibrium phases and resulting phase diagrams can nevertheless be predicted by a Maxwell double-tangent construction. This includes phases with sustained regular or irregular out-of-equilibrium dynamics as further corroborated by bifurcation studies and time simulations.</description>

      <title>An amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf bifurcation -- derivation, analysis and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ weakly nonlinear theory to derive an amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf instability, i.e., a generic large-scale oscillatory instability for systems with two conservation laws. The resulting equation represents in the conserved case the equivalent of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation obtained in the nonconserved case as amplitude equation for the standard Hopf bifurcation.Considering first the case of a relatively simple symmetric Cahn-Hilliard model with purely nonreciprocal coupling, we derive the nonlinear nonlocal amplitude equation with real coefficients and show that its bifurcation diagram and time evolution well agree with results for the full model. The solutions of the amplitude equation and their stability are analytically obtained thereby showing that in oscillatory phase separation the suppression of coarsening is universal. Second, we lift the two restrictions and obtain the amplitude equation in the generic case that has complex coefficients, that also shows very good agreement with the full model as exemplified for some transient dynamics that converges to traveling wave states.</description>

      <title>Constructing longulence in the Galerkin-regularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger and complex Ginzburg-Landau systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Quasi-)periodic solutions are constructed analytically for Galerkin-regularized or Fourier truncated nonlinear Schr\"odinger (GrNLS) systems and numerically for those of complex Ginzburg-Landau (GrCGL). New GrNLS features include the existence of nontrivial solutions occupying a single mode, thus independent of the truncation, and quasi-periodic tori with and without introducing on-torus invariants. Numerical tests find that instability leads such solutions to nontrivial longulent states with remarkable solitonic longons, corresponding to presumably whiskered tori. The possibility of nontrivially longulent GrCGL states, not proved yet, is discussed for motivation.</description>

      <title>Multisoliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip--flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</description>

      <title>Soliton foam formation in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of composite solitons produced by scalar fields without thermal phase transitions in the early Universe is considered. We present numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of soliton structures at the post-inflationary stage. The realistic initial conditions are obtained through the simulation of multiple quantum fluctuations during the inflation epoch. The initial field distributions allow to form local soliton clusters in the early Universe without the need for the thermal production of a soliton network throughout the Universe. We find that in three-dimensional space, the nontrivial composite field structures are formed in the form of &lt;&lt;soliton foam&gt;&gt;, consisting of closed domain walls, domain walls bounded by cosmic strings, and scalar field radiation. The possible cosmological implications of the soliton foam are discussed.</description>
