      <title>The Nature of Transaction Cost: Eliminating Misunderstandings and Reconstructing Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connotation of transaction costs has never been definitively determined, and the independence of the concept has never been rigorously demonstrated. This paper delves into the thought systems of several prominent economists in the development of transaction cost economics, starting from first-hand materials. By combining multiple works of the authors, it reconstructs the true meanings and identifies endogeneity issues and logical inconsistencies. The conclusion of this paper is bold. Previous research has been largely filled with misinterpretations and misunderstandings, as people have focused solely on the wording of transaction cost definitions, neglecting the nature of transaction costs. The intention of transaction cost theory has been unwittingly assimilated into the objects it intends to criticize. After delineating the framework of "transaction costs-property rights-competition", this paper reconstructs the concept of transaction costs and the history of transaction cost concepts, providing a direct response to this theoretical puzzle that has plagued the academic community for nearly a century.</description>

      <title>Identifying Heterogeneous Decision Rules From Choices When Menus Are Unobserved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given only aggregate choice data and limited information about how menus are distributed across the population, we describe what can be inferred robustly about the distribution of preferences (or more general decision rules). We strengthen and generalize existing results on such identification and provide an alternative analytical approach to study the problem. We show further that our model and results are applicable, after suitable reinterpretation, to other contexts. One application is to the robust identification of the distribution of updating rules given only the population distribution of beliefs and limited information about heterogeneous information sources.</description>

      <title>The Unfairness of $\varepsilon$-Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in decision-making processes is often quantified using probabilistic metrics. However, these metrics may not fully capture the real-world consequences of unfairness. In this article, we adopt a utility-based approach to more accurately measure the real-world impacts of decision-making process. In particular, we show that if the concept of $\varepsilon$-fairness is employed, it can possibly lead to outcomes that are maximally unfair in the real-world context. Additionally, we address the common issue of unavailable data on false negatives by proposing a reduced setting that still captures essential fairness considerations. We illustrate our findings with two real-world examples: college admissions and credit risk assessment. Our analysis reveals that while traditional probability-based evaluations might suggest fairness, a utility-based approach uncovers the necessary actions to truly achieve equality. For instance, in the college admission case, we find that enhancing completion rates is crucial for ensuring fairness. Summarizing, this paper highlights the importance of considering the real-world context when evaluating fairness.</description>

      <title>A characterization of absorbing sets in coalition formation games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.11689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a standard myopic dynamic process among coalition structures, an absorbing set is a minimal collection of such structures that is never left once entered through that process. Absorbing sets are an important solution concept in coalition formation games, but they have drawbacks: they can be large and hard to obtain. In this paper, we characterize an absorbing set in terms of a collection consisting of a small number of sets of coalitions that we refer to as a "reduced form" of a game. We apply our characterization to study convergence to stability in several economic environments.</description>

      <title>Speed, Accuracy, and Complexity</title>

Abstract: This paper re-examines the validity of using response time to infer problem complexity. It revisits a canonical Wald model of optimal stopping, taking signal-to-noise ratio as a measure of problem complexity. While choice quality is monotone in problem complexity, expected stopping time is inverse $U$-shaped. Indeed decisions are fast in both very simple and very complex problems: in simple problems it is quick to understand which alternative is best, while in complex problems it would be too costly -- an insight which extends to general costly information acquisition models. This non-monotonicity also underlies an ambiguous relationship between response time and ability, whereby higher ability entails slower decisions in very complex problems, but faster decisions in simple problems. Finally, this paper proposes a new method to correctly infer problem complexity based on the finding that choices react more to changes in incentives in more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Many Valued Logic Systems in Theoretical Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is an original attempt to understand the foundations of economic reasoning. It endeavors to rigorously define the relationship between subjective interpretations and objective valuations of such interpretations in the context of theoretical economics. This analysis is substantially expanded through a dynamic approach, where the truth of a valuation results in an updated interpretation or changes in the agent's subjective belief regarding the effectiveness of the selected action as well as the objective reality of the effectiveness of all other possible actions (i.e. consequence realization). Complications arise when the economic agent is presented with a set of actions that render ambiguous preference, or when the effectiveness of an action cannot be perceived upon its selection, thereby necessitating a different theory of choice and consequence realization.</description>
