      <title>B\"{a}cklund-Darboux transformations for super KdV type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a Miura transformation, we derive a generalized super modified Korteweg-de Vries (gsmKdV) equation from the generalized super KdV (gsKdV) equation. It is demonstrated that, while the gsKdV equation takes Kupershmidt's super KdV (sKdV) equation and Geng-Wu's sKdV equation as two distinct reductions, there are also two equations, namely Kupershmidt's super modified KdV (smKdV) equation and Hu's smKdV equation, which are associated with the gsmKdV equation. We then construct a number of B\"{a}cklund-Darboux transformations (BDTs) for both the gsKdV and gsmKdV equations, elucidating the interrelationship between them. By proper reductions, we are able to not only recover the previously known BDTs for Kupershimdt's sKdV and smKdV equations, but also to obtain the BDTs for the Geng-Wu's sKdV/smKdV and Hu's smKdV equations. As applications, we construct some exact solutions for those equations.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Small-Dispersion Limit of the Benjamin-Ono Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the solution of the Benjamin-Ono Cauchy problem for rational initial data in three types of double-scaling limits in which the dispersion tends to zero while simultaneously the independent variables either approach a point on one of the two branches of the caustic curve of the inviscid Burgers equation, or approach the critical point where the branches meet. The results reveal universal limiting profiles in each case that are independent of details of the initial data. We compare the results obtained with corresponding results for the Korteweg-de Vries equation found by Claeys-Grava in three papers. Our method is to analyze contour integrals appearing in an explicit representation of the solution of the Cauchy problem, in various limits involving coalescing saddle points.</description>

      <title>Integrability properties and multi-kink solutions of a generalised Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalised Fokker-Planck equation by making essential use of its linearisability through a Cole-Hopf transformation. We determine solutions of travelling wave and multi-kink type by resorting to a geometric construction in the regime of small viscosity. The resulting asymptotic solutions are time-dependent Heaviside step functions representing classical (viscous) shock waves. As a result, line segments in the space of independent variables arise as resonance conditions of exponentials and represent shock trajectories. We then discuss fusion and fission dynamics exhibited by the multi-kinks by drawing parallels in terms of shock collisions and scattering processes between particles, which preserve total mass and momentum. Finally, we propose B\"acklund transformations and examine their action on the solutions to the equation under study.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation in the field of a rotating dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that two permanent magnets of fixed orientation will either always repel or attract one another regardless of the distance between them. However, if one magnet is rotated at sufficient speed, a stable position at a given equilibrium distance can exist for a second free magnet. The equilibrium is produced by magnetic forces alone, which are strong enough to maintain a levitating state under gravity. We show that a stable levitation can be obtained when the rotating magnet is tilted from the rotation axis, with no offset in its position. In this regime, the levitating magnet remains centered and its spinning rate remains negligible, while its magnetic moment precesses in synchronization with the driving magnet. We provide a physical explanation of the levitation through a model relying on static dipolar interactions between the two magnets and present experimental results which validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Trees and superintegrable Lotka-Volterra families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any tree on $n$ vertices we associate an $n$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system with $3n-2$ parameters and, for generic values of the parameters, prove it is superintegrable, i.e. it admits $n-1$ functionally independent integrals. We also show how these systems can be reduced to an ($n-1$)-dimensional system which is superintegrable and solvable by quadratures.</description>

      <title>On a quadratic Poisson algebra and integrable Lotka-Volterra systems with solutions in terms of Lambert's W function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of integrable nonhomogeneous Lotka-Volterra systems whose quadratic terms are defined by an antisymmetric matrix and whose linear terms consist of three blocks. We provide the Poisson algebra of their Darboux polynomials, and prove a contraction theorem. We then use these results to classify the systems according to the number of functionally independent (and, for some, commuting) integrals. We also establish separability/solvability by quadratures, given the solutions to the 2- and 3-dimensional systems, which we provide in terms of the Lambert W function.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>
