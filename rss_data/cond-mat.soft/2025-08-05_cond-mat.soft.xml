      <title>Mean-field model for the bubble size distribution in coarsening wet foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. Understanding of coarsening in foams with a moderate liquid content has been improved by recent experiments. However, a model predicting the observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi &gt; 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.</description>

      <title>Substrate stiffness governs dynamics and self-organization of nascent biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary success of bacteria lies in their ability to form complex surface-associated communities in diverse biophysical settings. However, it remains poorly understood how compliance of soft surfaces, measured in terms of their elastic deformability, impacts the dynamics and self-organization of bacterial cells proliferating into colonies. Using experiments and biomechanical modelling, here we study the expansion and self-organization of bacterial cells into sessile colonies on soft substrates. The dynamics and spatiotemporal structures were captured by visualising growing bacterial colonies on nutrient-rich, soft agarose pads, with elastic modulus in the range ~0.3 kPA to ~100 kPA by varying the concentration of the agarose in the underlying substrate. Our results show that, at the scale of the colonies, significant differences emerge in the spreading dynamics and colony geometry as the substrate stiffness is altered: softer substrates promote distinct, multilayered colony structures, and as revealed by fractal analysis of the colony boundaries, they exhibit higher boundary roughness. In contrast, colonies growing on harder substrates first grow up to large monolayers, before undergoing the mono-to-multilayer transition (MTMT), showing nearly 300% increase in the overall colony area at MTMT. A simple biomechanical model captures the role of effective drag forces at different scales, acting on the colonies as they spread on substrates with different stiffness: higher drag in soft substrates drive early verticalisation of the colonies, while lower effective drag delays the MTMT, resulting in larger colony areas. Based on the results and biomechanical insights, a comprehensive data-backed numerical model is currently being developed. Our findings highlight the role of surface stiffness in determining the self-organization of bacterial cells into an expanding multi-scale colony.</description>

      <title>Correlated cell movements drive epithelial finger formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epithelia form protective barriers in multicellular organisms. To maintain homeostasis, they must be able to regenerate and heal damaged areas. This occurs through collective cell migration, during which finger-like protrusions commonly appear. Whether these protrusions are driven by specialised leader cells, biochemical cues, or generic physical interactions remains unclear. Integrating in vitro imaging, agent-based simulations, and continuum modelling, we show that correlated active cell motion alone suffices to produce fingers. Leader cells, signalling, and proliferation modulate, but do not trigger, this pattern. Our results show that the key mechanism underlying a complex biological process can be understood using a general framework of the physics of dense active matter.</description>

      <title>Cascade Crack in Chain of Beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a homogeneous chain of spheres linked by liquid bridges under tension. The rupture of a single liquid bridge leads to a fragmentation cascade driven by the inverse relation between the capillary force and the sphere distances. The initial length of the liquid bridges determines the number and size of the fragments and the velocity of the fragmentation front.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Depletion Force in Complex Coacervates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionalities and applications of complex coacervates -- liquid condensates resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation of charged polymers -- are significantly influenced by the dispersion and aggregation states of guest macromolecules. Intriguingly, guest macromolecules exhibit a strong tendency to aggregate within coacervates even in the absence of apparent chemical incompatibility, indicating a universal aggregation mechanism at play in these environments. Using extensive MD simulations, we identify electrostatic depletion -- a strong force arising from electrostatic correlations within the host polyelectrolyte network that drives guest aggregations. Due to electrostatic depletion, neutral polymers, low-charge-density polyelectrolytes, and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit effective attractions in coacervates, in stark contrast to their behavior in dilute solutions. Unlike traditional depletion effect that requires mismatched length scale and morphology, electrostatic depletion is relevant in fluid systems where solute and solvent are both polymers with comparable size. Our discovery bridges a critical knowledge gap in the molecular physics of densely charged, crowded liquids and holds significant implications for the design of synthetic protocells and advanced drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Force and geometric signatures of the creep-to-failure transition in a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular creep is the slow, sub-yield movement of constituents in a granular packing due to the disordered nature of its grain-scale interactions. Despite the ubiquity of creep in disordered materials, it is still not understood how to best predict the creep-to-failure regime based on the forces and interactions among constituents. To address this gap, we perform experiments to explore creep and failure in quasi two-dimensional piles of photoelastic disks, allowing the quantification of both grain movements and grain-scale contact force networks. Through controlled external disturbances, we investigate the emergence and evolution of grain rearrangements, force networks, and voids to illuminate signatures of creep and failure. Surprisingly, the force chain structure remains dynamic even in the absence of particle motion. We find that shifts in force chains provide an indication to larger, avalanche-scale disruptions. We reveal connections between these force signatures and the geometry of the voids in the pile. Overall, our novel experiments and analyses deepen our mechanical and geometric understanding of the creep-to-failure transition in granular systems.</description>

      <title>Confinement geometry governs the impact of external shear stress on active stress-driven flows in microtubule-kinesin active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids generate internal active stress and exhibit unique responses to external forces such as superfluidity and self-yielding transitions. However, how confinement geometry influences these responses remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate microtubule-kinesin active fluids under external shear stresses in two geometries. In slab-like confinement (a narrow-gap cavity), external stresses propagated throughout the system, leading to stress competition and a kinematic transition that shifted dynamics from active stress-dominated to shear stress-dominated flow. At the transition, we estimate the active stress to be ~1.5 mPa. Simulation supported that this transition arises from stress competition. In contrast, in ring-like confinement (a toroidal system), external forces acted locally, inducing a mini cavity flow that triggered self-organized reconfiguration rather than direct entrainment. These findings show that the response of active fluids to external forcing depends not only on the magnitude of the applied stress but also on how confinement geometry directs and redistributes that stress, revealing a new approach to controlling active fluid behavior by combining static geometrical design with dynamic external stimuli for real-time modulation of flow patterns. Such control strategies may be applied to microfluidic systems, where external inputs such as micromechanical actuators can dynamically tune active fluid behavior within fixed device geometries, enabling transitions between chaotic and coherent flows for tasks such as mixing, sorting, or directed transport.</description>

      <title>Primitive chain network simulations of the creep of entangled polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the behavior of entangled polymers in startup shear flows with constant shear rates has been thoroughly investigated, the response under creep has not been frequently considered. In this study, primitive chain network simulations, based on a multi-chain sliplink model, are modified so as to describe creep experiments. Creep simulations are compared to a literature dataset of an entangled polybutadiene solution, and qualitative agreement is found in the nonlinear range, i.e., under large stresses. Simulations allow one to extract details of the transient molecular motion, and results suggest that the deformation-induced disentanglement is relatively mild in the stress-controlled mode as compared to the rate-controlled one, because coherent molecular tumbling at the start of flow is disrupted.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Molecular Structure of Lipid Nanoparticles through in-silico Self-Assembly for Rational Delivery Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a leading platform in the delivery of RNA-based therapeutics, playing a pivotal role in the clinical success of mRNA vaccines and other nucleic acid drugs. Their performance in RNA encapsulation and delivery is critically governed by the molecular structure of ionizable lipids and the overall formulation composition. However, mechanistic insight into how these factors govern LNP architecture and function remains limited, primarily owing to the challenges of capturing nanoscale assembly and organization using experimental techniques. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate how ionizable lipid chemistry influences LNP self-assembly, internal organization, and surface properties. We further explore the effects of formulation ratios and pH-dependent deprotonation on both the internal structure and surface morphology of LNPs. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate how in silico structural characteristics can inform the rational design of novel ionizable lipids and optimization of formulation ratios, supported with experimental validations. Our findings offer a molecular-level understanding of LNP assembly dynamics and architecture, thereby establishing a computational framework linking lipid chemistry and LNP formulation to the structure and performance of LNP, to advance the rational design of novel LNP delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven ANN model for estimating unfrozen water content in the thermo-hydraulic simulation of frozen soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study integrates a data-driven model for estimating the unfrozen water content into the thermo-hydraulic coupling simulation of frozen soils. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to develop this data-driven model using a dataset from the literature. Thereafter, a numerical algorithm was developed to implement the data-driven model into the thermo-hydraulic simulation. In the numerical algorithm, the frozen and unfrozen zones are distinguished first according to the freezing temperature, where the unfrozen water at frozen nodes is updated using the ANN model. Subsequently, discretized hydraulic and thermal equations are solved sequentially and iteratively using Newton-Raphson method until the temperature and unfrozen water content satisfy the tolerance simultaneously. Horizontal and vertical freezing experiments are used to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithm. The computed variations in temperature, total water, unfrozen water, and ice content achieve good agreements with measured data. Some key features of frozen soils, such as water migration and ice formation, and the increase in total water content, are reproduced by the developed algorithm. Additionally, the comparison between the ANN model and existing empirical equations for determining unfrozen water content demonstrates that the ANN model offers a better performance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and modeling the mechanical behavior of an anion exchange membrane for carbon capture applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new direct air capture (DAC) technology uses a moisture swing (MS) process with anion exchange membranes, potentially offering a more energy-efficient way to remove CO2 from the air. In this MS process, the membrane absorbs CO2 as it dries and releases it when water is added. Understanding the mechanical behavior of these membranes is essential for improving the design and efficiency of DAC systems and prolonging sorbent lifetime. This study tested one anion exchange membrane, Fumasep FAA-3, under mechanical loading and various temperature and humidity conditions to measure its swelling, stiffness, strength, plastic deformation, and stress relaxation. Experimental results were used to identify a mechanical model for FAA-3 that can be used to predict the material's nonlinear viscous behavior under various loads and environments.</description>

      <title>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 10%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</description>

      <title>Contact-induced molecular reorganization in E. coli model lipid membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological membranes are complex, dynamic structures essential for cellular compartmentalization, signaling, and mechanical integrity. The molecular organization of eukaryotic membranes has been extensively studied, including the lipid raft-mediated lateral organization and the influence of the specific molecular interactions. Bacterial membranes were traditionally viewed as compositionally simpler and structurally uniform. Recent evidence, however, reveals that they possess significant lipid diversity and can form functional microdomains reminiscent of eukaryotic lipid rafts, despite lacking sterols and sphingolipids. Yet, the impact of unspecific physical contacts on the local molecular organization and evolution of the prokaryotic membranes remains poorly understood. Here we use a model lipid membrane mimicking the composition of Escherichia coli's inner membrane to investigate the impact of contacting substrates on the membrane nanoscale evolution, when close to its transition temperature, $T_m$. As expected, the presence of a substrate lowers the $T_m$ by $\sim$10 {\deg}C and induces a differential leaflet transition. However, it also slows down the phase transition kinetics by almost 2 orders of magnitude while simultaneously enabling a spinodal-like lateral molecular reorganization. This creates local alterations of the phase of the membrane, with the emergence of mechanically stiffer, yet still fluid nanodomains evolving over substrate-dependent timescales, consistent with a substrate-biased lipid flip-flop mechanism. The results verify previous theoretical predictions and demonstrate that a general physical mechanism -- driven by membrane-surface interactions -- can spontaneously induce lipid domain formation in bacterial membranes. This is bound to have notable consequences for its function and mechanical role, including in processes like osmotic pressure regulation.</description>

      <title>Shear-driven memory effects in carbon black gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsive hydrogels can sense environmental stimuli and respond as actuators by expelling water and changing shape. In this article, we develop theory to demonstrate that groups of responsive hydrogels can also communicate with each other, by utilising the effect of elastic deformation on chemical reaction dynamics. Specifically, we consider a system of two spatially-separated chemically responsive hydrogels suspended in a solution in which a Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ)-type reaction occurs. Solving for the gel dynamics with the transport of solvent through the poroelastic network and the chemical kinetics, we show how the periodic swelling-deswelling oscillations of each gel can become coupled, and how this coupling can be exploited to send signals from one gel to the other via mechanical manipulation of the sender that affect the local (and thus global) frequency of oscillation.</description>

      <title>Droplet Removal by Capillary Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of liquid droplets from solid surfaces is central to cleaning, coatings and oil recovery. Here we investigate liquid droplets capillary lifted by an immiscible working liquid. The rising working liquid triggers the formation of a capillary bridge between the solid and the air interface, which can lead to full, partial, or no droplet dewetting. Our theoretical model predicts, and experiments confirm, that the effectiveness of droplet removal can be tuned by manipulating the droplet contact angle with the solid and the interfacial tensions at play. Significantly, dewetting can be enhanced by employing working liquids with high interfacial tension, in contrast to common surface cleaning strategies where surfactants are used to reduce interfacial tension. Our findings can open new avenues for droplet manipulation with reduced resources and more sustainable environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Complexation of a Thermoresponsive Brush-Type Polyelectrolyte with an Oppositely Charged Surfactant: Effect of Temperature and Surfactant Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsive drug delivery vectors can be designed using oppositely charged polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes. As a model, we created a brush-type copolymer (PECop), combining alginate and Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), whose side chains respond to temperature. Aggregation of PECop with the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) was examined versus surfactant concentration and temperature. We used surface tension, electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential, potentiometry, light scattering, and atomic force microscopy to analyze the complexes. PECop/DTAB complexes form spherical, monodisperse aggregates in certain surfactant ranges, even though the copolymer itself is polydisperse. The binding isotherms combine features of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems and hydrophobically modified polymers. Compared to alginate alone, PECop binds six times more DTAB at 1 mM surfactant concentration. Temperature responsiveness depends on surfactant concentration (cs). The surfactant triggers progressive collapse of polymer chains, maximized at cs = 2.8 mM, where thermo-responsiveness is lost. For cs 10 mM, size increases above LCST. This inversion in thermal response with rising surfactant concentration suggests changing aggregate structure, offering new avenues for drug delivery system design using these polymer-surfactant complexes.</description>

      <title>Design and demonstration of a direct air capture system with moisture-driven CO2 delivery into aqueous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture (DAC) system was designed and demonstrated. A laboratory-scale system delivering ~1 g CO2 per day was demonstrated in a laminar flow hood and a small pilot-scale system that could deliver ~100 g CO2 daily was operated outdoors in a 4.2 m2 (areal surface area) raceway pond. Elongated mesh tube packets were designed to contain AER beads with high surface area for contacting the air and were found to reduce drying and CO2 loading time ~4-fold over larger mesh bags. Whereas this system was designed for CO2 delivery for cultivating photosynthetic microbes, its potential uses are much broader and include CO2 use in the food and beverage industry, conversion to fuels and chemicals, and sequestration. Techno-economic assessments for a practical scenario based on current results are \$670/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$280/tonne to extract CO2 from solution, purify and compress to 15 MPa for sequestration. An aspirational scenario modelling reasonable improvements to develop AER sorbents with a capacity of 4 mmol CO2 per gram of sorbent and water uptake of 50 wt.%, which leads to sorbent drying and loading within 1 h, shows a potential to reach \$51/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$109/tonne to get to 15 MPa for sequestration. Life cycle analysis shows the aspirational moisture-driven process uses up to 87% less energy than thermal and/or vacuum swing DAC by using energy from water evaporation; however, ~330 wt.% water uptake by the sorbent contained in a hydrophilic mesh packets leads to ~33-fold higher water use than the thermodynamic limits, which emphasizes future research is needed to increase sorbent hydrophobicity while maintaining and further increasing ion exchange capacity needed to bind CO2.</description>

      <title>RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Solvent-induced ion clusters generate long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental results by the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have identified a dramatic deviation from previously established theories of simple electrolytes. This deviation, referred to as anomalous underscreening, suggests that the range of electrostatic interactions increase upon a further addition of salt, beyond some threshold concentration (usually about 1M). In this theoretical work, we explore an extension of the Restricted Primitive Model (RPM) wherein a short-ranged pair potential of mean force (sPMF) is added to the usual Coulombic interactions so as to mimic changes of the hydration as two ions approach one another. The strength of this potential is adjusted so that the modified RPM saturates at a realistic concentration level (within a range 4-7M, typical to aqueous 1:1 salts). We utilise grand canonical simulations to establish surface forces predicted by the model and compare them directly with SFA data. We explore different sPMF models, which in all cases display significant clustering at concentrations above about 1M. In these models, we find significant double-layer repulsion at separations that significantly exceed those expected from standard RPM predictions. We do not, however, observe an increase of the screening length with salt concentration, but rather that this screening length seemingly saturates at a (rather high) value. The simulated long-ranged interactions are shown to correlate with ion cluster formation, implicating the important role of accompanying {\em cluster-cluster} interactions. In particular, steric interactions between clusters (manifested in density-density correlations) are quite relevant in these systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Continuum-level Closures For Control of Interacting Active Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter swarms -- collectives of self-propelled particles that could self-assemble, ferry microscopic cargo, or endow materials with dynamic properties -- remain hard to steer. In crowded systems, tracking or controlling individual agents becomes challenging, so strategies should operate on macroscopic fields like particle density. Yet predicting how density evolves is difficult due to inter-agent interactions. For model-based feedback control methods -- like Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- fast, accurate, and differentiable models are crucial. Detailed agent-based simulations are too slow, necessitating coarse-grained continuum models. However, constructing accurate closures -- approximations expressing the effect of unresolved microscopic states (e.g., agent positions) on continuum dynamics -- is challenging for active matter swarms. We present a learning-for-control framework that learns continuum closures from agent simulations, demonstrated with active Brownian particles under a controllable external field. Our Universal Differential Equation (UDE) framework represents the continuum as an advection-diffusion equation. A neural operator learns the advection term, providing closure relations for microscopic effects like self-propulsion, interactions, and external field responses. This UDE approach, embedding universal function approximators in differential equations, ensures adherence to physical laws (e.g., conservation) while learning complex dynamics directly from data. We embed this learned continuum model into MPC for precise agent simulation control. We demonstrate this framework's capabilities by dynamically exchanging particle densities between two groups, and simultaneously controlling particle density and mean flux to follow a prescribed sinusoidal profile. These results highlight the framework's potential to control complex active matter dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artificial Bubble Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised of viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The appearance and growth of bubbles are connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes simultaneously oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. For large nuclei, bubbles grow anisotropically because of contact line pinning. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Topological defects, such as disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals, are fundamental to many physical systems and applications. In this work, we study the behavior of nematic disclinations in thin parallel-plate geometries with strong patterned planar anchoring. Building on prior models, we solve both the forward problem -- predicting disclination trajectories from given surface patterns -- and an extended inverse problem -- designing surface patterns to produce a tunable family of disclination curves under varying system parameters. We present an explicit calculation for pattern construction, analyze parameter limitations and stability constraints, and highlight experimental and technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I~show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I prove that the nonlinear tensions in vertex models of tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained understanding of cell neighbour exchanges for continuum descriptions of epithelia.</description>

Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Cooperation and Self-Interest in a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>
