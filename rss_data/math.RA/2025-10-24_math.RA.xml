      <title>The trace Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository paper, various properties of matrix traces, determinants and adjugate matrices are proved, including the *trace Cayley-Hamilton theorem*, which says that \[ kc_k + \sum_{i=1}^k \operatorname{Tr} (A^i) c_{k-i} = 0 \qquad \text{for every } k\in\mathbb{N} \] whenever $A$ is an $n\times n$-matrix with characteristic polynomial $\det (tI_n - A) = \sum_{i=0}^n c_{n-i} t^i$ over a commutative ring $\mathbb{K}$. While the results are not new, some of the proofs are. The proofs illustrate some general techniques in linear algebra over commutative rings.</description>

      <title>Stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras, traces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras with applications to inverse semigroup algebras and Leavitt path algebras, recovering old results and proving some new ones. In addition, we develop a theory of (faithful) traces on ample groupoid algebras, mimicking the $C^*$-algebra theory but taking advantage of the fact that our functions are simple and so do not have integrability issues, even in the non-Hausdorff setting. The theory of traces is closely connected with the theory of invariant means on Boolean inverse semigroups. It turns out that for Hausdorff ample groupoids with compact unit space, having a stably finite algebra over some commutative ring implies the existence of a tracial state on its reduced $C^*$-algebra. We include an appendix on stable finiteness of more general semigroup algebras, improving on an earlier result of Munn, which is independent of the rest of the paper.</description>

      <title>The quiver with superpotentials of a $d$-angulation of a marked surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we associate a quiver with superpotential to each $d$-angulation of a (unpunctured) marked surface. We show that, under quasi-isomorphisms, the flip of a $d$-angulation is compatible with Oppermann's mutation of (the Ginzburg algebra of) the corresponding quiver with superpotential, thereby partially generalizing the result in [LF09]. Applying to the generalized $(d-2)$-cluster categories associated to this quiver with superpotential, we prove that some certain almost complete $(d-2)$-cluster tilting objects in the higher cluster category have exactly $d-1$ complements.</description>

      <title>Twisted products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A twisting of a monoid $S$ is a map $\Phi:S\times S\to\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the identity $\Phi(a,b) + \Phi(ab,c) = \Phi(a,bc) + \Phi(b,c)$. Together with an additive commutative monoid $M$, and a fixed $q\in M$, this gives rise a so-called twisted product $M\times_\Phi^qS$, which has underlying set $M\times S$ and multiplication $(i,a)(j,b) = (i+j+\Phi(a,b)q,ab)$. This construction has appeared in the special cases where $M$ is $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, $S$ is a diagram monoid (e.g.~partition, Brauer or Temperley-Lieb), and $\Phi$ counts floating components in concatenated diagrams.
  In this paper we identify a special kind of `tight' twisting, and give a thorough structural description of the resulting twisted products. This involves characterising Green's relations, (von Neumann) regular elements, idempotents, biordered sets, maximal subgroups, Sch\"{u}tzenberger groups, and more. We also consider a number of examples, including several apparently new ones, which take as their starting point certain generalisations of Sylvester's rank inequality from linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Double Poisson (vertex) algebra cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.</description>
