      <title>Sobolev spaces $W_2^{1/2}$: simultaneous improvement of functions by a homeomorphism of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for every continuous real-valued function $f$ on the circle $\mathbb T$ there exists a change of variable, i.e., a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$, such that the superposition $f\circ h$ is in the Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. In this paper we obtain certain results on simultaneous improvement of functions by a single homeomorphism. The main result is as follows: there does not exist a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$ such that $f\circ h\in W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ for every $f\in C^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. Here $C^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ is the space of all functions on $\mathbb T$ satisfying the Lipschitz condition of order $1/2$.</description>

      <title>The entrywise calculus and dimension-free positivity preservers, with an Appendix on sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of a classical theme in analysis and matrix positivity: the question of which functions preserve positive semidefiniteness when applied entrywise. In addition to drawing the attention of experts such as Schoenberg, Rudin, and Loewner, the subject has attracted renewed attention owing to its connections to various applied fields and techniques. In this survey we will focus mainly on the question of preserving positivity in all dimensions. Connections to distance geometry and metric embeddings, positive definite sequences and functions, Fourier analysis, applications and covariance estimation, Schur polynomials, and finite fields will be discussed.
  The Appendix contains a mini-survey of sphere packings, kissing numbers, and their "lattice" versions. This part overlaps with the rest of the article via Schoenberg's classification of the positive definite functions on spheres, aka dimension-free entrywise positivity preservers with a rank constraint - applied via Delsarte's linear programming method.</description>

      <title>Matrix weighted estimates on spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper matrix quantitative weighted estimates on spaces of homogeneous type, such as endpoint estimates, strong type estimates are provided. To that end we extend some earlier results on convex body domination due to Nazarov, Petermichl, Treil and Volberg to this setting. We also provide a $T(1)$ alike convex body domination result analogous to the one provided by Lerner and Ombrosi, and an application to vector valued extensions of Petermichl operators.</description>

      <title>On the mixed Bourgain-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the mixed Bourgain-Morrey spaces and obtain their preduals. The boundedness of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, iterated maximal operator, fractional integral operator, singular integral operator on these spaces is proved. The Littlewood-Paley theory for mixed Bourgain-Morrey spaces and their preduals are established. As applications, we consider wavelet characterizations for mixed Bourgain-Morrey spaces and a fractional chain rule in mixed Bourgain-Morrey Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. In addition, we give a description of the dual of mixed Bourgain-Morrey spaces and conclude the reflexivity of these spaces.</description>

      <title>The scalar $T1$ theorem for pairs of doubling measures fails for Riesz transforms when p not 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for an individual Riesz transform in the setting of doubling measures, the scalar $T1$ theorem fails when $p \neq 2$: for each $ p \in (1, \infty) \setminus \{2\}$, we construct a pair of doubling measures $(\sigma, \omega)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with doubling constant close to that of Lebesgue measure that also satisfy the scalar $\mathcal{A}_p$ condition and the full scalar $L^p$-testing conditions for an individual Riesz transform $R_j$, and yet $\left ( R_j \right )_{\sigma} : L^p (\sigma) \not \to L^p (\omega)$.
  On the other hand, we improve upon the quadratic, or vector-valued, $T1$ theorem of Sawyer-Wick when $p \neq 2$ on pairs of doubling measures: we dispense with their vector-valued weak boundedness property to show that for pairs of doubling measures, the two-weight $L^p$ norm inequality for the vector Riesz transform is characterized by a quadratic Muckenhoupt condition $A_{p} ^{\ell^2, \operatorname{local}}$, and a quadratic testing condition. Finally, in the appendix, we use constructions of Kakaroumpas-Treil to show that the two-weight norm inequality for the maximal function cannot be characterized solely by the $A_p$ condition when the measures are doubling, contrary to reports in the literature.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of coefficients of three-term relations for basic hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any three basic hypergeometric series ${}_{2}\phi_{1}$ whose respective parameters $a, b, c$ and a variable $x$ are shifted by integer powers of $q$ are linearly related with coefficients that are rational functions of $a, b, c, q$, and $x$. This relation is called a three-term relation for ${}_{2}\phi_{1}$. In this paper, we prove that the coefficients of the three-term relation for ${}_{2}\phi_{1}$ considered in the author's earlier paper (2022) have ninety-six symmetries, and present explicit formulas describing these symmetries.</description>

      <title>A Novel Schwartz Space for the $\left(k,\frac{2}{n}\right)-$Generalized Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwartz space is the natural ambient space for dealing with the classical Fourier transform beyond $L^2-$spaces. However, when studying more general transforms, such as the $(k,a)-$generalized Fourier transform, these spaces lose several important properties, such as invariance. To address this issue, we introduce a Schwartz-type space, denoted by $\mathcal{S}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$, which is tailored for the $\left(k,\frac{2}{n}\right)-$generalized Fourier transform. This space retains the invariance property of the classical Fourier transform and is useful in cases where the standard Schwartz space is not. To prove afterwards that $\mathcal{S}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $L^p(d\mu_{k,n})$, for $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, we identify the underlying subspace of functions with bounded support, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$. Finally, we discuss a conjecture regarding extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Basic hypergeometric identities derived from three-term relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2015, Ebisu presented a new method for finding hypergeometric identities based on three-term relations for the ${}_{2} F_{1}$ hypergeometric series. By using this method, he derived almost all of the previously known hypergeometric identities, as well as many new ones. In this paper, we derive several basic hypergeometric identities, including both well-known and not widely known ones, by applying a $q$-analogue of Ebisu's method to three-term relations for the ${}_{2} \phi_{1}$ basic hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>Branched It\^o formula and natural It\^o-Stratonovich isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branched rough paths, defined as paths with values in the character group of the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$, constitute integration theories that may fail to satisfy the usual integration by parts identity. Using known results on the primitive elements of $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ we can view it as a commutative cofree Hopf algebra (i.e. a commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra) and thus write an explicit change-of-variable formula for solutions to rough differential equations. This formula restricts to the well-known It\^o formula in the very special case of semimartingales. In addition, we establish an isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ and the shuffle algebra over its primitives, which extends Hoffman's exponential for the quasi-shuffle algebra, and can therefore be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of the usual It\^o-Stratonovich correction formula for semimartingales. Indeed, this can be stated as a characterisation of the algebra structure of any commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra. Compared to previous approaches, this transformation has the key property of being natural in the decorating vector space. We study the one-dimensional case more closely, by introducing the branched analogue of the Kailath-Segall polynomials and Dol\'eans-Dade exponential, and conclude with some examples of branched rough path lifts of a stochastic process which are not quasi-geometric.</description>

      <title>Index theory for singular Lagrangian systems and Bessel-type differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present manuscript is to develop an index theory for singular Lagrangian systems, with a particular focus on the important class of singular operators given by Bessel type differential operators. The main motivation is to address several challenges posed by singular operators, which appear in a wide range of applications: celestial mechanics (for instance, perturbations in planetary motion), oscillatory systems with time dependent forcing, electromagnetism (such as wave equations in nonuniform media), and quantum mechanics (notably certain Schroedinger equations with periodic potentials).
  We pursue two principal objectives. First, we establish a spectral flow formula and a Morse Index Theorem for gap-continuous paths of singular Sturm Liouville operators. By means of these index formulas, we construct a Morse index theory for a broad class of Bessel type differential operators and apply it to a family of asymptotic solutions of the gravitational n body problem.
  Finally, our new index theory provides new insight into a phenomenon first observed by Rellich concerning the spectrum of one-parameter families of Sturm Liouville operators with varying domains.</description>
