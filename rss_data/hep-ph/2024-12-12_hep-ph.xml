      <title>Positively Identifying HEFT or SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the bounds on Wilson coefficients of the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT) mandated by unitarity and analyticity. These positivity constraints can be projected into the space of the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) as HEFT$\,\supset\,$SMEFT. Doing so reveals a subspace allowed by the HEFT but forbidden by SMEFT positivity, thereby identifying a region that could herald the use of the wrong EFT rather than a pathological UV. Restricting to custodial symmetric dimension-eight Higgs operators, there is a unique pair within the SMEFT where this concept can be sharply realized and directly probed at colliders.</description>

      <title>Symbolic regression for precision LHC physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential of symbolic regression (SR) to derive compact and precise analytic expressions that can improve the accuracy and simplicity of phenomenological analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As a benchmark, we apply SR to equation recovery in quantum electrodynamics (QED), where established analytical results from quantum field theory provide a reliable framework for evaluation. This benchmark serves to validate the performance and reliability of SR before extending its application to structure functions in the Drell-Yan process mediated by virtual photons, which lack analytic representations from first principles. By combining the simplicity of analytic expressions with the predictive power of machine learning techniques, SR offers a useful tool for facilitating phenomenological analyses in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Mediated Dark Matter at a low reheating temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new study on the Gravity-Mediated Dark Matter (GMDM) scenario, where interactions between dark matter (DM) and the Standard Model are mediated by spin-two particles. Expanding on this established framework, we explore a novel regime characterized by a low reheating temperature that offers an alternative to the conventional thermal relic paradigm. This approach opens new possibilities for understanding the dynamics of the dark sector, encompassing both the dark matter particles (fermion, scalar and vector) and the spin-two mediators. Our analysis examines the constraints imposed by the relic abundance of DM, collider experiments, and direct detection searches, spanning a wide mass range for the dark sector, from very light to extremely heavy states. This work opens new possibilities for the phenomenology of GMDM.</description>

      <title>Melting of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ pairs in the pre-equilibrium stage of proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the melting of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs in the early stage of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions. We describe the early stage in terms of an evolving $SU(3)$ glasma stage, that is dominated by intense, out-of-equilibrium gluon fields. On top of these fields, we liberate heavy quark-antiquark pairs, whose constituents are let evolve according to relativistic kinetic theory coupled to the gluon fields. We define a pair-by-pair probability that the pair melts during the evolution, which we relate to the relative distance between the two particles in the pair, as well as to the fluctuations of the color charges induced by the interaction of the quarks with the gluon fields. We find that the fluctuations of the color charges favor the melting of the pairs. Moreover, we estimate that within $0.2$ fm/c of proper time, measured with respect to the formation time of the pairs, about the $50\%$ of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs melt as a result of the diffusion of the heavy quarks in the gluon fields; this time estimate doubles when color fluctuations are neglected.</description>

      <title>On radiative corrections to lepton number violating processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the minimal model of the seesaw mechanism by introducing two right-handed neutrinos, whose masses are comparable to the electroweak scale. This framework is attractive, since it is testable at terrestrial experiments. A critical consequence of this mechanism is the violation of lepton number conservation due to the Majorana masses of both active neutrinos and heavy neutral leptons. In particular, we investigate the impact of the radiative corrections to Majorana masses of left-handed neutrinos on the lepton number violating processes, such as the neutrinoless double beta decay: $(Z, A) \to (Z+2,A) + 2 e^-$ and the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay: $e^- e^- \to W^- W^-$. It is shown that the cross section of the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay can increase by ${\cal O}(10)$~% when the masses of heavy neutral leptons are ${\cal O}(1)$~TeV, which has significant implications on future experiments.</description>

      <title>Production of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion at electron-positron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), we study the production of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion at electron-positron colliders. Two diquark configurations of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ and $(cc)[^1S_0]_{6}$ are considered, and the $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ state dominates the produciotn of $T_{cc}$. We discuss two hadronization models of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ intermediate state into the tetraquark $T_{cc}$. At the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV and the luminosity of $10^{34}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$, it is promising to observe the tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion process. We find that the cross sections are sensitive to charm quark mass. And the cross sections at CEPC also have strong dependence on the hadronization models, as well as the photon spectrum functions for initial photons.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the longitudinal structure function at next-to-leading order approximation at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal structure function is considered at the next-to-leading order approximation using the expansion method, as defined by M.B.Gay Ducati and P.B.Goncalves [Phys.Lett.B {\bf390}, 401 (1997)] and further developed by Jingxuan Chen et al., [Chin.Phys.C {\bf48}, 063104 (2024)]. This method provides results for a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$ values. It is observed that the behavior of the longitudinal structure function depends on the fractional momentum carried by gluons at low $x$. The extracted longitudinal structure functions $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$ are in line with data from the H1 Collaboration [V. Andreev et al. (H1 Collaboration), Eur. Phys. J. C 74, 2814 (2014)] and the CT18 parametrization method [T.-J. Hou et al., Phys. Rev. D 103, 014013 (2021)].</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Invisible: ALPs and Sterile Neutrinos at the LHC and HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of using the signature of mono-Higgs plus large missing energies to constrain on two new physics models, namely the model of an axion-like particle (ALP) and the model of sterile neutrinos. We focus on the Higgs-ALP interactions starting at dimension-six and the Higgs-sterile neutrino interactions starting at dimension-five, via the processes $pp \to h a a$ for ALP production and $pp \to h N N$ for sterile neutrinos at the LHC and High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), followed by the Higgs decay $h \to b \bar{b}$. We establish bounds on the ALP-Higgs coupling $\frac{C_{aH}}{\Lambda^2}$ and sterile neutrino-Higgs coupling $\frac{\lambda_3}{M_*}$, respectively, for ALP and sterile-neutrino mass ranging from 1 to 60 GeV, using the recent ATLAS data on mono-Higgs plus missing energies at the LHC $(\sqrt{s} = 13\;{\rm TeV}\; {\rm and}\; \mathcal{L} = 139\; {\rm fb}^{-1})$. The most stringent constraint occurs in the missing transverse energy $M_{ET}$ range $200 &lt; M_{ET} \leq 350$ GeV. We also estimate the sensitivities that we can achieve at the HL-LHC ($\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and $\mathcal{L} = 3000$ fb$^{-1}$). We obtain improved sensitivities across various missing energy regions. The ALP model exhibits better sensitivities, particularly at lower mass range, compared to the sterile neutrino model, which shows weaker sensitivities across similar mass and energy ranges. Our results underscore the potential of the mono-Higgs signature as a robust probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Constraining the SMEFT at Present and Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from SMEFiT3.0, a global SMEFT fit of Higgs, top quark, and diboson production data from the LHC. Our updated analysis includes recent inclusive and differential measurements from the LHC Run II, together with the exact implementation of electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) from LEP and SLD. We then analyse the impact of HL-LHC measurements by adding to SMEFiT3.0 the projections obtained by extrapolating from Run II data. Finally we estimate the potential of two proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ colliders, the FCC-ee and the CEPC, in further improving the bounds on the SMEFT parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of pseudo-scalar mesons through the QCD chiral crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise recent progress towards the non-perturbative determination of thermal spectral functions for pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD by exploiting constraints imposed by micro-causality at finite temperature. For temperatures not much above the vacuum particle mass, continuous contributions from scattering, Landau damping and collective excitations are found to be negligible. This allows for a quantitative description of spatial and temporal lattice correlators in terms of thermoparticles, i.e.~vacuum excitations modified by medium effects, with resonance-like structures persisting for a range above the chiral crossover.</description>

Abstract: The impact of Lorentz violating (LV) terms on the exclusive $e^+e^-$ production in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is investigated, considering vectorial and axial couplings. Results for the differential and total cross-sections are presented, and the sensitivity to a time-like coupling is estimated. Our results indicate that this process can improve the current upper bounds on the LV terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dijet production in pA collisions at forward rapidities at next-to-eikonal accuracy. We restrict ourselves to the next-to-eikonal corrections that are induced by the quark background field of the target. We consider all possible channels, compute scattering amplitudes both in general kinematics and in the back-to-back limit. By using these results, we compute the back-to-back production cross section and obtain a factorized expression with a quark TMD times associated hard factor for each channel.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the standard HVM and 95.4 GeV excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the flavor, ALPs, and collider phenomenology of the standard hierarchical VEVs model. The flavor bounds are derived for a symmetry-conserving scenario, and the most powerful constraints are originating from the neutral meson mixing observable $C_{\eps_K}$ pushing the scale $\Lambda$ around $10^4$ TeV. The masses of ALPs $a_2$ and $a_6$ are excluded in the ranges $12-10^7$ eV and $2 \times 10^2 - 10^7$ eV, respectively in the symmetry-conserving scenario. The collider phenomenology is conducted for the soft-symmetry breaking scenario, where the pseudoscalar $a_3$ can account for the 95.4 GeV di-photon excess reported by the LHC. The scalars $h_i$, in particular, scalars $h_1, h_2, h_4,h_5$, and $h_6$ are within the reach of the high-luminosity LHC, high-energy LHC, and a 100 TeV collider such as FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Neutrino-Dark Matter Interaction in DSNB and AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a neutrino-scalar dark matter (DM) $\nu{\text{-}}\phi$ interaction and consider Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) representing distinctive neutrino sources. We focus on interaction mediated by a heavy fermionic particle $F$ and investigate the attenuation of neutrino fluxes from these sources. We model the unscattered neutrino flux from DSNB via core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and star-formation rate (SFR), then use the DUNE experiment to set limits on DM-neutrino interaction. For AGNs, NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 where the neutrino carries energy above TeV, we select the kinematic region $m^2_F \gg E_\nu m_\phi \gg m^2_\phi$ such that the $\nu \phi$ scattering cross section features an enhancement at high energy. We investigate the constraint on $m_\phi$ and scattering cross section by including DM density spikes at center of AGNs and computing the neutrino flux at IceCube, where the $\phi\phi^*$ annihilation cross section is implemented to obtain the saturation density of the spikes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stable numerical solution of the impact-parameter-dependent next-to-leading order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation is presented for the first time. The rapidity evolution of the dipole amplitude is discussed in detail. Dipole amplitude properties, such as the evolution speed or anomalous dimension behaviour, are studied as a function of the impact parameter and the dipole size and compared to solutions of the impact-parameter-dependent leading-order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with the collinearly improved kernel. The next-to-leading evolution also strongly suppresses the Coulomb tails compared to the collinearly improved and leading order solutions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>An Improved Precision Calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ Contact Term within Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is an as-yet unobserved nuclear process, which stands to provide crucial insights for model-building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Its detection would simultaneously confirm the hypothesis that neutrinos are Majorana fermions, thus violating lepton-number conservation, and provide the first measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale. This work aims to improve the estimation within chiral effective field theory of the so-called ``contact term'' for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, a short-range two-nucleon effect which is unaccounted for in traditional nuclear approaches to the process. We conduct a thorough review of the justifications for this contact term and the most precise computation of its size to date $g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.3(6) at renormalisation point $\mu=m_\pi$), whose precision is limited by a truncation to elastic intermediate hadronic states. We then perform an extension of this analysis to a subleading class of inelastic intermediate states which we characterise, delivering an updated figure for the contact coefficient ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.4(3) at $\mu=m_\pi$) with uncertainty reduced by half. Such ab initio nuclear results, especially with enhanced precision, show promise for the resolution of disagreements between estimates of $0\nu\nu\beta\beta$ from different many-body methods.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and uncover a novel sensitivity of cosmological observables to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto a Charged Black Hole in Consistent 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astrophysics, accretion is the process by which a massive object acquires matter. The infall leads to the extraction of gravitational energy. Accretion onto dark compact objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs is a crucial process in astrophysics as it turns gravitational energy into radiation. The accretion process is an effective technique to investigate the properties of other theories of gravity by examining the behavior of their solutions with compact objects. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of test particles around a charged four dimensional Einstein Gauss Bonnet black hole in order to understand their innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and energy flux, differential luminosity, and temperature of the accretion disk. Then, we examine particle oscillations around a central object via applying restoring forces to treat perturbations. Next, we explore the accretion of perfect fluid onto a charged 4D EGB black hole. We develop analytical formulas for four-velocity and proper energy density of the accreting fluid. The EGB parameter and the charge affect properties of the test particles by decreasing their ISCO radius and also decreasing their energy flux. Increasing the EGB parameter and the charge, near the central source reduces both the energy density and the radial component of the infalling fluid's four-velocity.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: Differential Equations and Complete Solutions for General Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and solve a complete system of differential equations for general tree-level inflation correlators with an arbitrary number of massive scalar exchanges and time-dependent couplings. Any massive tree correlators can be uniquely fixed by solving this system of equations with appropriate boundary conditions. We take a hybrid approach to solve this system, using the differential equation to get the inhomogeneous solution and the bulk time integrals to determine the homogeneous solution. Altogether, we obtain analytical results for all tree-level massive inflation correlators with generic kinematics, expressed as multivariate hypergeometric series of energy ratios. The result can be neatly organized as a sum of the completely inhomogeneous solution, which we call the massive family tree, and all of its cuts. As simple applications, we provide full analytical expressions for tree correlators with one, two, and three massive exchanges.</description>

      <title>Did IceCube discover Dark Matter around Blazars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jet and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bumblebee is a foundation model for particle physics discovery, inspired by BERT. By removing positional encodings and embedding particle 4-vectors, Bumblebee captures both generator- and reconstruction-level information while ensuring sequence-order invariance. Pre-trained on a masked task, it improves dileptonic top quark reconstruction resolution by 10-20% and excels in downstream tasks, including toponium discrimination (AUROC 0.877) and initial state classification (AUROC 0.625). The flexibility of Bumblebee makes it suitable for a wide range of particle physics applications, especially the discovery of new particles.</description>

      <title>The center-symmetric Landau gauge meets the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lattice implementation of the recently introduced center-symmetric Landau gauge is discussed and its predictions confronted with numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the link average and the link correlators computed in that gauge are order parameters of the confinement-deconfinement transition at nonzero temperature. Strictly speaking, this requires a specific treatment of the Gribov copies that we discuss in detail. The numerical simulations comply with the theoretical predictions for the link average computed below and above the deconfinement temperature. Our results show that, within appropriately chosen gauges, one can construct local order parameters for center symmetry, as proxies for the non-local Polyakov loop.</description>

      <title>Constraining Asymmetric DM Properties by Black Hole Formation in Neutron Stars and Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rhox\gtrsim10^{9}\unit{GeV/cm^3}$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. If a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) forms from ADM, then its low temperature and densely cored profile render evaporation from the BEC negligible, strengthening detectability of low-mass DM. Because of this, we find that the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$\mx$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $\mx=10^{-15}\unit{GeV}$ thanks to their far lower value of $\mx$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects.</description>

      <title>SS433 Microquasar Jet and the TeV Resurgence beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of microquasars in our galaxy is one of the frontiers of high energy astrophysics. Their models are based on a capturing mass Black Hole, with a nearby spiraling binary companion star. The companion star mass feeds the accretion disk around the Black Hole. This energy also fuels an orthogonal precessing X gamma jets. The spiral precessing tail of such microquasars, as the SS433 system, is due to an ultra-relativistic jet, spraying nucleons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The up-down jet is observable in radio, X, gamma spectra. Its long spirals are spread and diluted within a light-year distance. The source is inside the W50 supernova remnant nebula , whose asymmetry reflects the past and present role of the SS433 jet. Very recently HESS, HAWC discovered, surprisingly at a much far disconnected distance from the SS433, the resurgence of a twin gamma beam tail. Nearly 75 years light distance far away from the same inner jet source. The recent standard model is based on an accelerating shock wave which reaccelerates, the resurgence of a PeV nucleon beam and its TeV secondaries. The surprising recollimation of this TeV beam jet is difficult to be accepted, in the assumption of a planarlike Fermi shock wave model. Here we discuss an alternative framework based on known high energy nuclear physics, capable to simultaneously explaining both the disconnected and the aligned hard TeV jet appearance. Several consequences, that might also be able to validate the model, are considered.</description>

      <title>Isolated Black Holes as Potential PeVatrons and Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of Kerr black holes in four-dimensional space-times subjected to external gravitational fields. Using the Ernst formalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of rotating black holes and demonstrate that their static tidal Love numbers vanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result is intimately related to the presence of underlying non-linear symmetries. Our analysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and confirms the robustness of four-dimensional black holes against tidal forces.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Lorentz invariance violation and the muon content of extensive air showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive air showers (EAS), produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, serve as probes of particle interactions, providing access to energies and kinematical regimes beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. Measurements from multiple cosmic-ray detectors indicate a significant, yet unexplained, discrepancy between the observed muon content in EAS and that predicted by state-of-the-art interaction models, suggesting a need for refinements in our understanding of fundamental physics. Here we show that a tiny, experimentally allowed, violation of the Lorentz invariance (LIV) may result in the suppression of the number of electrons in EAS, leaving the muon number intact and explaining both the ''muon excess'' and its energy dependence. On the other hand, we use the lack of a much stronger discrepancy between EAS data and simulations to obtain strict constraints on the LIV scale. Future experimental tests of this LIV scenario are outlined.</description>

Abstract: The high speeds seen in rapidly rotating pulsars after supernova explosions present a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics. Numerous theories have been suggested over the years to explain this sudden "kick" imparted to the neutron star, yet each comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Unraveling the origins of pulsar kicks not only enhances our understanding of supernova mechanisms but also opens up possibilities for exploring new physics. In this brief review, we will introduce pulsar kicks, examine the leading hypotheses, and explore future directions for this intriguing phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Toward discovering the excited $\Omega$ baryons through nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonleptonic weak decay processes $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+/\Omega(1P)\pi^+/\Omega(1D)\pi^+/\Omega(2S)\pi^+$ are studied using the constituent quark model. The branching fraction of $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+$ is predicted to be $1.0\%$. Considering the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ resonance as a conventional $1P$-wave $\Omega$ excite state with spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$, the newly measured ratio $\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega(2012)\pi^+ \to (\Xi\bar{K})^-\pi^+ ]/\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega \pi^+]$ at Belle can be well understood. Besides, the production rates for the missing $1P-$wave state $\Omega (1^2P_{1/2^-})$, two spin quartet $1D-$wave states $\Omega (1^4D_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega (1^4D_{3/2^+})$, and two $2S$-wave states $\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega(2^4S_{3/2^+})$ are also investigated. It is expected that these missing excited $\Omega$ baryons should have large potentials to be discovered through the nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$ in forthcoming experiments by Belle II and/or LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a standard hierarchical VEVs model which predicts the leptonic mixing angles in terms of the Cabibbo angle, and masses of strange and charm quarks as $\sin \theta_{12}^\ell \geq 1 - 2 \sin \theta_{12}$, $\sin \theta_{23}^\ell \geq 1 - \sin \theta_{12}$, and $\sin \theta_{13}^\ell \geq \sin \theta_{12} - \frac{m_s}{m_c}$ for the normal mass ordering of neutrinos. This results in very precise predictions of the leptonic mixing angles given by $\sin \theta_{12}^\ell = 0.55 \pm 0.00134 $, $\sin \theta_{23}^\ell = 0.775 \pm 0.00067 $, and $\sin \theta_{13}^\ell = 0.1413 - 0.1509 $. Furthermore, we predict neutrinos to be the Dirac kind disfavouring the inverted mass hierarchy. The standard hierarchical VEVs model predicts a possible new class of the dark matter candidate, named as neutrinic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring SMEFT Couplings Using the Forward-Backward Asymmetry in Neutral Current Drell-Yan Production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral current Drell-Yan (DY) lepton-pair production is considered in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Using the open-source fit platform xFitter, we investigate the impact of high-statistics measurements of the neutral current DY (NCDY) forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm{FB}}$ near the weak boson mass scale in the present and forthcoming stages of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Besides recovering earlier results on the $A_{\rm{FB}}$ sensitivity to parton distribution functions, we analyze the precision determination of $Z$-boson couplings to left-handed and right-handed $u$-quarks and $d$-quarks, and explore Beyond-Standard-Model contributions using the SMEFT framework. We perform a sensitivity study and comment on the role of the $A_{\rm{FB}}$ asymmetry for the electroweak SMEFT fit and precision $Z$-boson physics at the LHC and high-luminosity HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>SMEFT at NNLO$+$PS: $Vh$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) the next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) QCD corrections to the Higgsstrahlungs ($Vh$) processes in hadronic collisions are calculated and matched to a parton shower (PS). NNLO+PS precision is achieved for the complete sets of SMEFT operators that describe the interactions between the Higgs and two vector bosons and the couplings of the Higgs, a $W$ or a $Z$ boson, and light fermions. A POWHEG-BOX implementation of the computed NNLO SMEFT corrections is provided that allows for a realistic exclusive description of $Vh$ production at the level of hadronic events. This feature makes it an essential tool for future Higgs characterisation studies by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Utilising our new Monte Carlo code the numerical impact of NNLO+PS corrections on the kinematic distributions in $pp \to Zh \to \ell^+ \ell^- h$ production is explored, employing well-motivated SMEFT benchmark scenarios.</description>

      <title>Octet baryon and heavy meson interactions in chiral effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the effective potentials of the octet baryon and heavy meson systems using the chiral effective field theory up to the next-to-leading order. We consider the contact terms, one-pseudoscalar-meson and two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange contributions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the short-, mid-, and long-range interactions in these systems. The low energy constants are correlated with those of the $\bar{N}N$ interaction using a quark-level Lagrangian approach. We also incorporate the decuplet baryon contributions in the loop diagrams. Our research provides new insights into several near-threshold charmed baryons [e.g., $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$, $\Xi_{c}(3055)$, and $\Omega_{c}(3188)$, etc.] around $3$ GeV from the hadronic molecular perspective. We also observe several molecular states, referred to as $\Xi_{c}$, within the mass range of $3100-3500$ MeV. Further measurements of their resonance parameters and decay patterns in experiments may help to discriminate the conventional baryon and hadronic molecule explanations for these near-threshold states.</description>

      <title>Proton spin in double-logarithmic approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton is a composite particle, so its spin S_P is made from the spins of the partons which the proton consists of. The discrepancy between S_P = 1/2 and the experimentally detected sum of the parton spins was named Proton Spin Puzzle. Solution to this problem includes formulae for the parton helicities valid in the whole range of x. There are approaches in the literature for calculating the helicities. As a theoretical basis they apply different evolution equations. Despite these equations are constructed for operating in widely different regions of x and account for different contributions, all of them equally well suited for solving the proton spin problem. Our explanation of this situation is that the main impact on values of the parton spin contributions should be brought not by the evolution equations themselves but by phenomenological fits for initial parton distributions. We suggest a more theoretically grounded approach to description of the parton helicities and apply it to solving the proton spin problem. It combines the total resummation of double logarithms (DL), accounting for the running coupling effects and DGLAP formulae, leading to expressions for the helicities valid at arbitrary x. As a consequence, the set of involved phenomenological parameters in our approach is minimal and its in uence on the helicity behaviour is weak. We apply our approach to solve the proton spin problem in the straightforward way and make an estimate, demonstrating that the RHIC data complemented by the DL contributions from the regions of x beyond the RHIC scope are well compatible with the value S_P = 1/2.</description>

      <title>Enabling Precise Predictions for Left-Right Symmetry at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the minimal Left-Right symmetric model that enables precise predictions in the gauge, scalar and neutrino sector. We revisit the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a non-trivial physical input scheme, expressing the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles. Fermion couplings are also determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. These analytic developments are implemented in a comprehensive FeynRules model file. We calculate the one loop QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant hadron-collider benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating $g_L \neq g_R$ gauge couplings.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs boson production and electroweak phase transition in the two-real-singlet model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons at hadron colliders can be enhanced by a double-resonant effect in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric two-real-singlet extension of the Standard Model, making it potentially observable in future LHC runs. The production rate is maximized for large scalar couplings, which prompts us to carefully reconsider the perturbativity constraints on the theory. This leads us to construct a new set of 140 benchmark points that have a triple Higgs boson production cross-section at least 100 times larger than the SM value. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition, both analytically at leading order, and numerically without the high-temperature expansion. Both analyses indicate that a first-order phase transition is incompatible with the requirement that both singlets have a non-zero vev in the present-day vacuum, as required by doubly-enhanced triple Higgs boson production. Allowing instead one of the singlets to remain at zero field value opens up the possibility of a first-order phase transition, while di-Higgs boson production can still be enhanced by a (single) resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on electrophilic scalar coupling from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ultralight electrophilic scalar field can produce a long-range Yukawa-like spatial profile around a rotating, magnetized star when coupled to the constant number density of electrons in either the magnetosphere or the star itself. This long-range scalar field generates an effective scalar charge in the star or its magnetosphere, leading to a long-range force between two compact stars in a binary system. The electrophilic scalar can also radiate from isolated pulsars or double pulsar binary systems. Using the Crab pulsar and PSR J0737-3039A/B as test cases, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron coupling by analyzing observations of long-range force, orbital period decay in binary systems, and pulsar spin-down rates. Among these, the most stringent limits on the coupling are obtained from the orbital period decay. However, these constraints can be significantly reduced if the scalar interacts with the pervasive cosmic neutrino background. Enhancing experimental sensitivity and studying compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further strengthen these bounds.</description>

Abstract: Radiative corrections due to initial state radiation in electron-positron annihilation are calculated within the QED structure function approach. Results are shown in the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation up to $O(\alpha^4 L^3)$ order, where $L=\ln(s/m_e^2)$ is the large logarithm. Several mistakes in previous calculations are corrected. The results are relevant for future high-precision experiments at $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faithful energy reconstruction is foundational for precision neutrino experiments like DUNE, but is hindered by uncertainties in our understanding of neutrino--nucleus interactions. Here, we demonstrate that dense neural networks are very effective in overcoming these uncertainties by estimating inaccessible kinematic variables based on the observable part of the final state. We find improvements in the energy resolution by up to a factor of two compared to conventional reconstruction algorithms, which translates into an improved physics performance equivalent to a 10-30% increase in the exposure.</description>

Abstract: Energy correlators provide a powerful observable to study fragmentation dynamics in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading nonperturbative corrections for projected $N$-point energy correlators are described by the same universal parameter for any $N$, which has already been determined from other event shape fits. Including renormalon-free nonperturbative corrections substantially improves theoretical predictions of energy correlators, notably the transition into the confining region at small angles. Nonperturbative corrections are shown to have a significant impact on $\alpha_s$ extractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model with the full one-loop prefactor. We focus on the gauge degrees of freedom and derive the degeneracy factors appearing in the functional determinant using group theoretical arguments. Our treatment shows that the transverse modes were previously overcounted, so we revise the calculation of that part of the prefactor. The new result modifies the gauge fields' contribution by $6\%$ and slightly decreases the previously predicted lifetime of the electroweak vacuum, which remains much longer than the age of the universe. Our discussion of the transverse mode degeneracy applies to any calculation of functional determinants involving gauge fields in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ultra-light axion with CP violating interactions with a dark sector and CP preserving interactions with the visible sector can act as a novel portal between dark matter and the Standard Model. In such theories, dark matter sources an axion field extending over the entire galaxy, the gradient of which can be searched for with precise spin precession experiments. A reinterpretation of existing co-magnetometer data already constrains theories that are consistent with astrophysical bounds, and near-future experiments will begin probing well-motivated models. The required interactions can arise from a confining hidden sector without necessitating fine-tuning of the axion's mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charm ($D$) and charm-strange ($D_s$) mesons are investigated in a variational scheme using Gaussian trial wave functions. The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance $r$, radial quantum number $n$, orbital quantum number $l$ and a trial parameter $\mu$. These wave functions are used to compute the expectation of Song and Lin potential dependent on $r$. The total energy (expectation of Hamiltonian) for each state is minimized with a parameter $\mu$ from the wavefunctions. The obtained spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the ($J$, $M^2$) and ($n_r$, $M^2$) planes. In ($J$, $M^2$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of $D$ and $D_s$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states. We have assigned the spin-parity to newly observed $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ as the strange partner of $D^*_2(2460)$ identified as $1^3P_2$, $D_1^*(2760)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ as $1^3D_1$, $D^*_3(2750)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)$ as $1^3D_3$, $D_2(2740)$ as $1D_2$, $D_0(2550)$ as $2^1S_0$, $D^*_1(2660)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2700)$ as $2^3S_1$, $D^*_J(3000)$ as $2^3P_0$ $D_J(3000)$ as $2P_1$, $D^*_2(3000)$ as $1^3F_2$ states.</description>

      <title>Maximal flavor violating $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model with singly-charged scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ $Z'$ model has emerged as a promising candidate to address the longstanding muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly. Flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions are subject to stringent constraints from the neutrino trident process and NA64$\mu$ experiments, which limit the $Z'$ mass to $m_{Z'}&lt;40$ MeV. To circumvent these constraints, flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions can be converted into maximal flavor-violating interactions through a discrete exchange symmetry. Maximal flavor-violating $Z'$ interactions contribute to $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ via the neutral current, yet the parameter space for this process conflicts with the $(g-2)_\mu$ allowed regions. To resolve this conflict, we propose introducing a singly-charged scalar that mediates via charged current interactions. This scalar is anticipated to produce a negative contribution to the lepton $(g-2)_l$ while concurrently inducing the tau decay $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$. Three distinct scenarios arise from the introduction of singly-charged scalars: the $\mathcal{O}_{LL}$ operator, driven by weak singlet and triplet, and the $\mathcal{O}_{LR}$ operator, driven by weak doublet. Our analysis of the phenomenology in these three cases reveals that the tension between the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly and $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ for large $Z'$ masses can be effectively alleviated only by the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet, whereas the singlet and doublet scenarios fall short. Furthermore, the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet offer an additional explanation for the electron $(g-2)_e$ anomaly. Our findings indicate that weak triplets could play a crucial role in $Z'$ models, potentially providing valuable insights for future research into $U(1)$ frameworks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution and axion-like particles: new constraints and hints from globular clusters in the GAIA DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons, natural in extensions of the Standard Model. Their interactions with ordinary matter and radiation are suppressed, making it challenging to detect them in laboratory experiments. However, these particles, produced within stellar interiors, can provide an additional mechanism for energy loss, potentially influencing stellar evolution. Prominent methods for searching for such effects involve measuring the properties of red giants and helium-burning stars in globular clusters (GCs). Here we use published catalogs of stars selected as members of seven GCs on the basis of parallaxes and proper motions measured by Gaia (Data Realease 3). Making use of previously derived theoretical relations and the new data, we find the upper limit on the ALP-electron coupling, g_{ae}&lt;5.2*10^{-14} (95% CL), and an indication (3.3 sigma) to nonzero ALP-photon coupling, g_{a\gamma}=(6.5+1.1-1.3)*10^{-11} GeV^{-1}. Given the precision of contemporary observational data, it is imperative to refine ALP constraints through more sophisticated analyses, which will be explored in detail elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Excited $\Omega$ hyperon in charmful $\Omega_b$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sextet $b$-baryon decay processes $\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega^{(*)}$, where $\Omega^*$ represents the $1P$-, $1D$- and $2S$-wave excited $\Omega$ hyperons in the spectroscopy. Using the constituent quark model, we obtain ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega)=2.1\times 10^{-4}$, which agrees with the previous studies to the order of magnitude. By identifying $\Omega(2012)$ as $\Omega(1^2P_{3/2^-})$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega(2012))=2.7\times 10^{-4}$ can be similarly significant. Additionally, $\Omega(1^2D_{5/2^+})$ and $\Omega(1^4D_{3/2^+},1^4D_{5/2^+})$ states exhibit production rates of 0.6, and (0.7, 1.0), respectively, relative to their ground-state counterpart. Notably, our findings suggest that ${\cal B}(\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+},2^4S_{3/2^+}))$ are as large as $(1.2,5.1)\times 10^{-4}$, making them accessible to experiments at LHCb.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on intrinsic transversal momentum distribution and the $k_T$ factorization revitalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize the factorization of soft and hard dynamics in the transversal plane of an exclusive QCD process by introducing the intrinsic transversal momentum distributions (iTMDs). We ingeniously study the $\pi$ and $K$ electromagnetic form factors by matching the next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation to the precise measurements or data-driven result from the modular dispersion relation, obtain the transversal-size parameter $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^2$ for the lowest Fock states. With this result, we extract the chiral mass of pion meson as $m_0^\pi(1 \, {\rm GeV}) = 1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV and explain the precise measurements of kaon form factor in the perturbative timelike region. As a byproduct, impressively, the introduction of iTMDs improves the perturbative QCD prediction down to a few GeV$^2$ for the electromagnetic form factors, confronting to the available experiment measurements and the lattice QCD evaluations.</description>

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We nonparametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our nonparametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/nonmonotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Free Streaming in Warm Wave Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for numerically computing the effects of free-streaming in scalar fields produced after inflation. First, we provide a detailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This prescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on subhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and importantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations on large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We then evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation, including the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations. We show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially adiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying, non-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we explore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field, including oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this paper, we make our code, ${\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\sf{CFL}}$), publicly available. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly relevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV, with the errors being only statistical. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by a factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simple hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor for model parameter fits and Goodness of Fit tests and composite hypothesis tests. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-charmonium interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic lattice QCD study on low-energy $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions based on (2+1) flavor configurations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and possess a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange potential. The resulting $S$-wave scattering lengths are $0.30(2)\left(^{+0}_{-2}\right)$ fm, $0.38(4)\left(^{+0}_{-3}\right)$ fm, and $0.21(2)\left(^{+0}_{-1}\right)$ fm for spin-$3/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, and spin-$1/2$ $N$-$\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance. Our findings may provide deeper understanding of the nonperturbative QCD phenomena ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to the in-medium $J/\psi$ mass modification as well as the properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Tomography of the Earth with the Hyper-Kamiokande Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using PREM as a reference model for the Earth density distribution we investigate the sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) detector to deviations of the Earth i) core average density $\bar{\rho}_C$, ii) lower mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{lman}$) and iii) upper mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{uman}$, from their respective PREM densities. The analysis is performed by studying the effects of the Earth matter on the oscillations of atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$, $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$. We implement the constraints on the variations of $\rho_C$, $\rho_{lman}$ and $\rho_{uman}$ following from the precise knowledge of the Earth mass $M_\oplus$ and moment of inertia $I_\oplus$, as well as from the requirement that the Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE). These constraints limit in the case of the three layer Earth density structure we are considering the maximal positive deviation of $\bar{\rho}_C$ from its PREM value to $10\%$. Considering the case of normal ordering (NO) of neutrino masses, we present results which illustrate the dependence of sensitivity to the core, lower and upper mantle average densities on the energy and zenith angle resolutions, on whether or not the prospective systematic errors are accounted for and on the value of $\theta_{23}$. We show, in particular, that in the ''nominal'' case of neutrino energy resolution $E_{res} = 30\%$ and zenith angle resolution $\theta_{zres} = 20^\circ$ and for, e.g., $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.45~(0.58)$, HK can determine the average core density $\bar{\rho}_C$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. after 6500 days of operation with an uncertainty of (-14.5\%)/+39.5\% ((-9.3\%/+31.7\%). In the ''more favorable'' case of $E_{res}= 20\%$ and $\theta_{zres} = 10^\circ$, and if $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.58~(0.45)$, the core density would be determined at $2\sigma$ C.L. with an uncertainty of (-8.3\%)/+9.8\% ((-9.2\%)/+11.3\%).</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>
