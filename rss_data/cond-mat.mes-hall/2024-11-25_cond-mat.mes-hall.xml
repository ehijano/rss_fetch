      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics in two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic and thermal transport properties in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been extensively investigated due to their potential to miniaturize transistors. Microscopically, electron-phonon interactions are considered the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism for electrons that limits carrier mobility beyond cryogenic temperatures. However, when electrons and phonons are considered as a single system, electron-phonon interactions conserve the total momentum and energy, leading to the possibility of low-dissipation transport. In this work, we systematically investigate the momentum circulation between electrons and phonons and its impact on carrier transport properties in 2D semiconductors given their strong electron-phonon interactions. We find that, when momentum circulation is taken into account, the total momentum in the coupled electron-phonon system is weakly dissipated, leading to a coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamic transport regime, in which electrons and phonons exhibit a joint drift motion rather than separate diffusive behaviors. In this new transport regime, charge transport properties are significantly enhanced. Contrary to previous belief, our results demonstrate that low-dissipation charge transport can occur despite strong electron-phonon interactions when there is effective momentum circulation between electrons and phonons mediated by the strong interactions. Our work advances fundamental understandings of carrier transport in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid ferroelectric tunnel junctions: State-of-the-art, challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) harness the unique combination of ferroelectricity and quantum tunneling, and thus herald new opportunities in next-generation nonvolatile memory technologies. Recent advancements in the fabrication of ultrathin heterostructures have enabled the integration of ferroelectrics with various functional materials, forming hybrid tunneling-diode junctions. These junctions benefit from the modulation of the functional layer/ferroelectric interface through ferroelectric polarization, thus enabling further modalities and functional capabilities than in addition to tunneling electroresistance. This perspective aims to provide in-depth insight into novel physical phenomena of several typical ferroelectric hybrid junctions, ranging from ferroelectric/dielectric, ferroelectric/multiferroic, ferroelectric/superconducting to ferroelectric/2D materials, and finally their expansion into the realm of ferroelectric resonant tunneling diodes (FeRTDs). This latter aspect, i.e., resonant tunneling offers a radically new approach to exploiting tunneling behavior in ferroelectric heterostructures. We discuss examples that have successfully shown room temperature ferroelectric control of parameters such as the resonant peak, tunnel current ratio at peak and negative differential resistance. We conclude the perspective by summarizing the challenges and highlighting the opportunities for the future development of hybrid FTJs with a special emphasis on a new possible type of FeRTD device. The prospects for enhanced performance and expanded functionality ignite tremendous excitement in hybrid FTJs and FeRTDs for future nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Spin Currents in Altermagnets via Magnon Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently identified class of magnetic materials, possess a spin-split Fermi surface that results in the so-called spin splitter effect, enabling the generation of a spin current transverse to the injection direction and whose polarization lies along the N\'eel vector. In this study, we investigate how magnons interact with electrons in an altermagnetic metal. We find that while the electron-magnon interaction does not perturb the magnon dispersion, a charge current flowing in the material can induce a transverse magnon spin current, analogous to the electronic spin splitter effect. This spin current possesses both electronic and magnonic characteristics, i.e., a chemical potential dependence and a strong temperature dependence. This effect realizes the efficient generation of spin currents via magnons without depending on the material's spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of dynamical coupling in artificial spin-ice systems by incorporating perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin-ice systems, consisting of arrays of interacting ferromagnetic nanoelements, offer a versatile platform for reconfigurable magnonics with potential in GHz logic and neuromorphic computing. However, weak dipolar coupling between nanoelements severely limits their functionality. We numerically demonstrate a rich spin-wave spectrum in a square spin-ice structure immersed in a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic matrix, which is different from a single spin-ice system. We observe a strong magnon-magnon coupling between the bulk second-order mode of the nanoelements and the fundamental mode of the matrix, supported by a pronounced anticrossing frequency gap. We show that, in addition to the dipolar coupling, exchange interactions at the nanoelement-matrix interface play a crucial role in this hybridization. Furthermore, the strength of the coupling can be enhanced by almost 40% just by reconfiguring the magnetization at the vertices from low-energy to high-energy monopole states. These results open the way to exploit artificial spin-ice systems for magnonic applications, taking advantage of the strong coupling and vertex-dependent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exciton Dressing by Extreme Nonlinear Magnons in a Layered Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations presenting nonlinear dynamics are fundamental phenomena with broad applications. A prime example is nonlinear optics, where diverse frequency mixing processes are central to communication, sensing, wavelength conversion, and attosecond physics. Leveraging recent progress in van der Waals magnetic semiconductors, we demonstrate nonlinear opto-magnonic coupling by presenting exciton states dressed by up to 20 harmonics of magnons, resulting from their nonlinearities, in the layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. We also create tunable optical side bands from sum- and difference-frequency generation between two optically bright magnon modes under symmetry breaking magnetic fields. Moreover, the observed difference-frequency generation mode can be continuously tuned into resonance with one of the fundamental magnons, resulting in parametric amplification of magnons. These findings realize the modulation of the optical frequency exciton with the extreme nonlinearity of magnons at microwave frequencies, which could find applications in magnonics and hybrid quantum systems, and provide new avenues for implementing opto-magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnon spintronics with Van der Waals magnets: from fundamentals to devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Frenkel-Wannier excitons facilitate ultrafast energy transfer at a 2D-organic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and organic semiconductors (OSCs) have emerged as promising material platforms for next-generation optoelectronic devices. The combination of both is predicted to yield emergent properties while retaining the advantages of their individual components. In OSCs the optoelectronic response is typically dominated by localized Frenkel-type excitons, whereas TMDs host delocalized Wannier-type excitons. However, much less is known about the spatial and electronic characteristics of excitons at hybrid TMD/OSC interfaces, which ultimately determine the possible energy and charge transfer mechanisms across the 2D-organic interface. Here, we use ultrafast momentum microscopy and many-body perturbation theory to elucidate a hybrid exciton at an TMD/OSC interface that forms via the ultrafast resonant F\"orster energy transfer process. We show that this hybrid exciton has both Frenkel- and Wannier-type contributions: Concomitant intra- and interlayer electron-hole transitions within the OSC layer and across the TMD/OSC interface, respectively, give rise to an exciton wavefunction with mixed Frenkel-Wannier character. By combining theory and experiment, our work provides previously inaccessible insights into the nature of hybrid excitons at TMD/OSC interfaces. It thus paves the way to a fundamental understanding of charge and energy transfer processes across 2D-organic heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for and ferromagnetic resonance spectra of magnetic bilayers coupled by interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IF-DMI) leads to non-collinear spin configurations within the magnetic layers of multilayer heterostructures, while its interlayer counterpart (IL-DMI) minimizes chiral states between the layers. Here, we demonstrate that the symmetries of these interactions are very different, even though both arise from pairwise exchange interactions between magnetic sites mediated by nonmagnetic atoms. By deriving new boundary conditions for the exchange operator and solving the associated boundary value problem, we show that, unlike IF-DMI, which does not contribute to the FMR frequencies, IL-DMI alters the frequencies of the fundamental FMR modes and can be separated from other contributions in an FMR experiment.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion universality of mesoscopic entanglement fluctuations in free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement fluctuations associated with Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of wavefunctions offer a unique perspective on various fundamental issues ranging from quantum thermalization to state preparation in quantum devices. Very recently, a subset of present authors have shown that in a class of free-fermion lattice models and interacting spin chains, entanglement dynamics enters into a new regime at long time, with entanglement probes displaying persistent temporal fluctuations, whose statistics falls into the seemingly disparate paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations in condensed matter physics. This motivate us to revisit here entanglement dynamics of a canonical bosonic model in many-body physics, i.e., a coupled harmonic oscillator chain. We find that when the system is driven out of equilibrium, the long-time entanglement dynamics exhibits strictly the same statistical behaviors as that of free-fermion models. Specifically, irrespective of entanglement probes and microscopic parameters, the statistical distribution of entanglement fluctuations is flanked by asymmetric tails: sub-Gaussian for upward fluctuations and sub-Gamma for downward; moreover, the variance exhibits a crossover from the scaling $\sim 1/L$ to $\sim L_A^3/L^2$, as the subsystem size $L_A$ increases ($L$ the total system size). This insensitivity to the particle statistics, dubbed boson-fermion universality, is contrary to the common wisdom that statistical phenomena of many-body nature depend strongly on particle statistics. Together with our previous work, the present work indicates rich fluctuation phenomena in entanglement dynamics awaiting in-depth explorations.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-hermitian Kitaev chain model, for arbitrary complex parameters. In particular, we give a concise characterisation of the curves of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the infinite size limit. Using this solution, we characterise under which conditions the skin effect is absent, and for which eigenstates this is the case. We also fully determine the region in parameter space for which the model has a zero mode.</description>

      <title>2D Semiconductors Superlattices as Hyperbolic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials are natural or engineered artificial structures that provide means to manipulate and control electromagnetic radiation, leading to a variety of strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. In this work, we explore the physical properties of the optical response of 2D semiconductor-based superlattices, which are engineered with atomic precision and composed of alternating 2D semiconductor monolayers and hexagonal-boron-nitride. We find that such superlattices exhibit a robust hyperbolic response at the visible to near-infrared spectrum, and with dimensions that are an order of magnitude smaller compared to conventional metal-based hyperbolic metamaterials, down to three active monolayers. By employing both analytical and numerical studies, we show that by varying the superlattice configuration we can control and manipulate the nature of the hyperbolic response. Finaly, we propose an optimal structure that will enable the experimental observation of this hyperbolic response in 2D semiconductors superlattices. Such highly compact hyperbolic materials of atomic precision could open the way for deep-subwavelength optoelectronic devices with extremely small footprint.</description>

      <title>Symmetry invariants and classes of quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems having weak spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12738v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry invariants of a group specify the classes of quasiparticles, namely the classes of projective irreducible co-representations in systems having that symmetry. More symmetry invariants exist in discrete point groups than the full rotation group $\mathrm{O(3)}$, leading to new quasiparticles restricted to lattices that do not have any counterpart in a vacuum. We focus on the fermionic quasiparticle excitations under ``spin-space group'' symmetries, applicable to materials where long-range magnetic order and itinerant electrons coexist. We provide a list of 218 classes of new quasiparticles that can only be realized in the spin-space groups. These quasiparticles have at least one of the following properties that are qualitatively distinct from those discovered in magnetic space group(MSG)s, and distinct from each other:(i) degree of degeneracy,(ii) dispersion as function of momentum, and(iii) rules of coupling to external probe fields. We rigorously prove this result as a theorem that directly relates these properties to the symmetry invariants, and then illustrate this theorem with a concrete example, by comparing three 12-fold fermions having different sets of symmetry invariants including one discovered in MSG. Our approach can be generalized to realize more quasiparticles whose little co-groups are beyond those considered in our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the excitation energy $ E_l $ on its absorption coefficients $ \alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ as a function of $ E_l $ for TBLG exhibits distinct peaks corresponding to its van Hove singularities (vHs). For small twist angles, such as $\theta \sim 1.8^{\circ}$, the magnitude of the resonant peak for $\alpha_1$ is roughly twice that of bilayer graphene (BLG). This enhanced response, compared to BLG, can be attributed to the increased density of states (DOS) in the twisted structure. However, as the twist angle increases the magnitude of the resonant peak approaches that of two decoupled single-layer graphene (SLG) sheets. On the other hand, the two-photon absorption coefficient $ \alpha_2 $ for TBLG at low twist angles displays an enhancement of about one order of magnitude compared to SLG at the energies corresponding to the resonant peak, as well as a small but notable increase relative to BLG. As the twist angle decreases from $ 8^{\circ} $ to $ 2.5^{\circ} $, the resonant peak intensifies by three orders of magnitude. Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases the resonant features exhibited by $\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ remain essentially unchanged but with a slight red-shift in their resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations for two-photon absorption and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>

Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the current avenues being pursued to scale semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. Adiabatic spin qubit transfer along a chain of tunnel-coupled quantum dots is one of the possible schemes. In this scheme, we theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit that is adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, such that interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent. We analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. In addition to the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting within each dot, leading to finite $T_{2}^{*}$ for the stationary spin qubit, we consider the effects activated by detuning sweeps: failure of charge transfer due to charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to the enhancement of spin-orbit mixing at the tunnel-induced anticrossing of states localized in the two dots, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge. We show that the latter effect is activated by differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Importantly, all the error mechanisms are more dangerous at low tunnel couplings. Our results indicate that away from micromagnets, maximizing the fidelity of coherent transfer aligns with minimizing charge transfer error that was previously considered in J. A. Krzywda and L. Cywi\'nski, Phys. Rev. B 104 075439 (2021). For silicon, we suggest having tunnel coupling fulfilling $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV when one aims to coherently transfer a spin qubit across a $\sim \!10$ $\mu$m long array of $\sim \! 100$ quantum dots with error less than $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Origin and Microscopic Mechanism of Electrical Magnetochiral Anisotropy in Tellurium</title>

Abstract: Non-linear transport effects in response to external magnetic fields, i.e. electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), have attracted much attention for their importance to study quantum and spin-related phenomena. Indeed, they have permitted the exploration of topological surface states and charge-to-spin conversion processes in low-symmetry systems. Nevertheless, despite the inherent correlation between the symmetry of the material under examination and its non-linear transport characteristics, there is a lack of experimental demonstration to delve into this relationship and to unveil their microscopic mechanisms. Here, we study eMChA in chiral elemental Tellurium (Te) along different crystallographic directions, establishing the connection between the different eMChA components and the crystal symmetry of Te. We observed different longitudinal eMChA components with collinear current and magnetic field, demonstrating experimentally the radial angular momentum texture of Te. We also measured a transverse non-linear resistance which, as the longitudinal counterpart, scales bilinearly with current and magnetic fields, illustrating that they are different manifestations of the same effect. Finally, we study the scaling law of the eMChA, evidencing that extrinsic scattering from dynamic sources is the dominant microscopic mechanism. These findings underscore the efficacy of symmetry-based investigations in understanding and predicting non-linear transport phenomena, with potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: Designing well-defined magnetic nanomaterials is crucial for various applications and it demands a comprehensive understanding of their magnetic properties at the microscopic level. In this study, we investigate the contributions to the total anisotropy of Mn-Co mixed spinel nanoparticles. By employing neutron measurements sensitive to the spatially resolved surface anisotropy with sub-\AA\space resolution, we reveal an additional contribution to the anisotropy constant arising from shape anisotropy and interparticle interactions. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between chemical composition, microstructure, morphology, and surface effects, providing valuable insights for the design of advanced magnetic nanomaterials for AC biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment by magnetic fluid hyperthermia.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to calculate the contribution of edge states to the thermal Hall conductivity and energy magnetization. A two-dimensional topological insulator in equilibrium at a finite temperature is analyzed in the presence of a static gravitational field, which mimics the variations in the temperature distribution. From this model, an effective boundary free energy functional for the gravitational field is derived. Our analysis reveals that, unlike in the case of massive Dirac fermions, the addition of the Newtonian mass term in the topological insulator model significantly modifies the quantum anomalous behavior of the boundary states, leading to a non-zero bulk thermal current. This additional contribution violates the Wiedemann-Franz law.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a basic computational tool in many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several noninteracting fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly log$(N)$ cost. We point out that the simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class, implying that our discovered exponential speedup is robust. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>
