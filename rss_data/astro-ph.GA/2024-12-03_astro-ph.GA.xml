      <title>The Baryonic Mass Estimates of the Milky Way Halo in the form of High Velocity Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo of our Galaxy is populated with a significant number of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) moving with a speed up to $500$ km/s. It is suggested that these HVCs might contain a non-negligible fraction of the missing baryons. The main aim of the current paper is to estimate the baryonic mass of the Milky Way halo in the form of HVCs in order to constrain a fraction of missing baryons in the form of these clouds. Such findings would give substantial help in the studying halo dynamics of our Galaxy.
  We first estimate the HVCs distance. We consider the most recent and updated HVC catalog, namely the Galactic All Sky Survey (GASS), which, however, covers the southern sky declinations, south of $b \leq 60^\circ$. Following a model presented in the literature, we assume that most of the HVCs (not all of the HVCs in the Milky Way) were ejected from the Magellanic Clouds (MCls) which is at a distance of about 50 kpc. We assume that the HVCs have a temperature in the range of about $10^2 - 10^4$ K, and are distributed in the Galactic halo as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. Since the GASS survey covers a small portion of the sky, we estimate the number of missing clouds by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The next step will be to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way contained in the form of these HVCs. The total mass resulted to be $\sim (7 \pm 2) \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ in the form of HVCs and compact high-velocity clouds (CHVCs).</description>

      <title>Star formation rate surface density main sequence evolution. Insights from a semi-analytic simulation since $z=12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high redshift ($z&gt;4$) spatially resolved observations with JWST have shown the evolution of star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and its main sequence in the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-$M_*$ diagram ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$MS) which is already observed at the cosmic morning ($z\sim7.5$). The use of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is physically motivated due to its normalization by the area where the star formation (SF) occurs, thus indirectly considering the gas density. The $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-$M_*$ diagram has been shown to complement widely used (specific)SFR-$M_*$, particularly to select passive galaxies. In this work we aim to establish the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ evolution since $z=12$ in the framework of LGalaxies2020 semi-analytical model (SAM) and to give an interpretation to recent observations. We estimate $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$(-$M_*$) and cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) for the simulated galaxy population and the sub-samples divided in stellar mass bins in the given redshift. The simulated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ decreases by $\sim3.5$ dex from $z=12$ to $z=0$. We show that galaxies with different stellar masses have different paths of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ evolution. %, driven by SFR and effective radius. We find $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$MS is already observed at $z\sim11$. The simulated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$MS agrees with the observed one at $z=0, 1, 2, 5$ and $7.5$ and with individual galaxies at $z&gt;10$. We show that the highest $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$MS slope of $0.709\pm0.005$ is at $z\sim3$, decreasing to $\sim0.085\pm0.003$ at $z=0$. This is mostly driven by a rapid decrease in SFR with additional size increase of the most massive galaxies in this redshift range. This coincides with the dominance of the most massive galaxies in the CSFRD from the SAM. Observations show the same picture in which $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ evolutionary path depends on the stellar mass.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Magnetic Field Properties in Bok Globules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bok globules are small, dense clouds that act as isolated precursors for the formation of single or binary stars. Although recent dust polarization surveys, primarily with Planck, have shown that molecular clouds are strongly magnetized, the significance of magnetic fields in Bok globules has largely been limited to individual case studies, lacking a broader statistical understanding. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive optical polarimetric survey of 21 Bok globules. Using Gaia and near-IR photometric data, we produce extinction maps for each target. Using the radiative torque alignment model customized to the physical properties of the Bok globule, we characterize the polarization efficiency of one representative globule as a function of its visual extinction. We thus find our optical polarimetric data to be a good probe of the globule's magnetic field. Our statistical analysis of the orientation of elongated extinction structures relative to the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations shows they do not align strictly parallel or perpendicular. Instead, the data is best explained by a bimodal distribution, with structures oriented at projected angles that are either parallel or perpendicular. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths on the scales probed by optical polarimetric data are measured using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique. We then derive magnetic properties such as Alfv\'en Mach numbers and mass-to-magnetic flux ratios. Our findings statistically place the large-scale (Av &lt; 7 mag) magnetic properties of Bok globules in a dynamically important domain.</description>

      <title>CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations -- II. Constraining cosmology and astrophysical processes with early- and late-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical processes impact galaxy formation and evolution in diverse ways, requiring validation of their implementation in cosmological simulations through comparisons with real data across various galaxy types and properties. In this second paper of the CASCO series, we compare the structural properties and dark matter (DM) content of early-type galaxies from the CAMELS IllustrisTNG simulations to three observational datasets (SPIDER, $\textrm{ATLAS}^{\textrm{3D}}$, and MaNGA DynPop), to constrain cosmological and astrophysical feedback parameters, contrasting these results with those obtained for late-type galaxies. We analyze the size-, internal DM fraction-, and DM mass-stellar mass relations, identifying the best-fit simulation for each dataset. For SPIDER, we find cosmological parameter values consistent with literature and results obtained from the comparison between simulations and late-type galaxies, with supernova feedback parameters differing from results derived for late-type galaxies. For $\textrm{ATLAS}^{\textrm{3D}}$, cosmological parameter results align with SPIDER, while supernova feedback parameters are more consistent with late-type galaxies results. MaNGA DynPop yields extreme cosmological parameter values but similar supernova feedback results to $\textrm{ATLAS}^{\textrm{3D}}$. However, no single simulation matches the full range of observational trends, especially when combining early- and late-type galaxies from MaNGA DynPop. These findings highlight the limitations of simulations in reproducing diverse galaxy properties, underscoring the challenge of capturing the complexity of galaxy formation across all types.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relation between environment and internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies using strong lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong lensing directly probes the internal structure of the lensing galaxies. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies and their environment using a sample of 15 strong lensing systems. We performed lens modeling for them using Lenstronomy and constrained the mass and light distributions of the deflector galaxies. We adopt the local galaxy density as a metric for the environment and test our results against several alternative definitions of it. We robustly find that the centroid offset between the mass and light is not correlated with the local galaxy density. This result supports using centroid offsets as a probe of dark matter theories since the environment's impact on it can be treated as negligible. Although we find a strong correlation between the position angle offset and the standard definition of the local galaxy density, consistent with previous studies, the correlation becomes weaker for alternative definitions of the local galaxy density. This result weakens the support for interpreting the position angle misalignment as having originated from interaction with the environment. Furthermore, we find the 'residual shear' magnitude in the lens model to be uncorrelated with the local galaxy density, supporting the interpretation of the residual shear originating, in part, from the inadequacy in modeling the angular structure of the lensing galaxy and not solely from the structures present in the environment or along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated growth of galaxy sizes along the star-forming main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data of $\sim 997$, intermediate redshifts $0.5 \leq z \leq 2.0$ galaxies from the GOODS-S field, with stellar mass range $9.8 \leq \log \mathrm{M}_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \leq 11.5$. We estimate the SFHs in three spatial regions (central region within the half-mass radii $\mathrm{R}_{50s}$, outskirts between $1-3~\mathrm{R}_{50s}$, and the whole galaxy) using pixel-by-pixel spectral-energy distribution (SED) fitting, assuming exponentially declining tau model in individual pixels. The reconstructed SFHs are then used to derive and compare the physical properties such as specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), mass-weighted ages (t$_{\mathrm{50}}$), and the half-mass radii to get insights on the interplay between the structure and star-formation in galaxies. The correlation of sSFR ratio of the center and outskirts with the distance from the main sequence (MS) indicates that galaxies on the upper envelope of the MS tend to grow outside-in, building up their central regions, while those below the MS grow inside-out, with more active star formation in the outskirts. The findings suggest a self-regulating process in galaxy size growth when they evolve along the MS. Our observations are consistent with galaxies growing their inner bulge and outer disc regions, where they appear to oscillate about the average MS in cycles of central gas compaction, which leads to bulge growth, and subsequent central depletion possibly due to feedback from the starburst, resulting in more star formation towards the outskirts from newly accreted gas.</description>

      <title>The Structure, Populations and Kinematics of the Milky Way central and inner Bulge with OGLE, APOGEE and Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the structure, kinematics, and chemo-dynamical properties of the Milky Way bulge using data from OGLE, APOGEE, and Gaia. Firstly, we identified 2,156 ab-type RR Lyrae stars (RRabs) from OGLE-IV, then through their apocenters derived from orbital integration, we distinguished three populations: the central bulge RRabs, the inner bulge RRabs and halo interlopers. Inner bulge RRabs kinematically align with the Galactic bar, while central bulge RRabs show slower rotation with lower velocity dispersion, which do not trace the bar. Higher velocity dispersion stars were identified as halo interlopers. Then, orbital analysis of 28,188 APOGEE Red Clump and Red Giant Branch stars revealed kinematic properties consistent with RRabs, and chemical abundance distribution displayed a bimodal stellar density pattern, suggesting complex star evolution histories and also slightly different star formation histories for the inner bulge and central bulge. The differences in the density distribution on the $|\mathrm{Z}|_{\text{max}}$-eccentricity plane for the central bulge, inner bulge, and halo regions are clearly detected. Finally, the chemodynamical analysis of 301,485 Gaia DR3 red giants without orbital integration indicated that metal-rich bulge stars form a bar-like structure, while metal-poor bulge stars are dominated by velocity dispersion. It is found that the classification of bulge stars based on orbital parameters, rather than solely on metallicity, provides a more accurate population separation. Our results also support that secular evolution of the Galactic disk is the primary origin of the bulge, and boxy/peanut (B-P) bulge population might be more dominant than X-shape bulge population.</description>

      <title>3D-PDR Orion dataset and NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations for Photodissociation Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dataset of simulations of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the Orion Bar and provide benchmarks of emulators for the dataset. Numerical models of PDRs are computationally expensive since the modeling of these changing regions requires resolving the thermal balance and chemical composition along a line-of-sight into an interstellar cloud. This often makes it a bottleneck for 3D simulations of these regions. In this work, we provide a dataset of 8192 models with different initial conditions simulated with 3D-PDR. We then benchmark different architectures, focusing on Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ANODE) based models (Code be found at https://github.com/uclchem/neuralpdr). Obtaining fast and robust emulators that can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D simulations of PDRs.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Long Period Variable Stars of And II Dwarf Satellite galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an extensive study of the spheroidal dwarf satellite galaxies around the Andromeda galaxy to produce an extensive catalog of LPV stars. The optical monitoring project consists of 55 dwarf galaxies and four globular clusters that are members of the Local Group. We have made observations of these galaxies using the WFC mounted on the 2.5 m INT in nine different periods, both in the i-band filter Sloan and in the filter V-band Harris. We aim to select AGB stars with brightness variations larger than 0.2 mag to investigate the evolutionary processes in these dwarf galaxies. The resulting catalog of LPV stars in Andromeda's satellite galaxies offers updated information on features like half-light radii, TRGB magnitudes, and distance moduli. This manuscript will review the results obtained for And II galaxy. Using the Sobel filter, we have calculated the distance modulus for this satellite galaxy, which ranges from 23.90 to 24.11 mag.</description>

      <title>Test of Cosmic Web-feeding Model for Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is yet to be understood how large-scale environments influence star formation activity in galaxy clusters. One recently proposed mechanism is that galaxy clusters can remain star-forming when fed by infalling groups and star-forming galaxies from large-scale structures surrounding them (the \textit{``web-feeding model"}). Using the COSMOS2020 catalog that has half a million galaxies with high accuracy ($\sigma_{\Delta z /1+z} \sim 0.01$) photometric redshifts, we study the relationship between star formation activities in galaxy clusters and their surrounding environment to test the web-feeding model. We first identify $68$ cluster candidates at $0.3 \leq z \leq 1.4$ with halo masses at $10^{13.0} - 10^{14.5}$ \SI{}{M_{\odot}}, and the surrounding large-scale structures (LSSs) with the friends-of-friends algorithm. We find that clusters with low fractions of quiescent galaxies tend to be connected with extended LSSs as expected in the web-feeding model. We also investigated the time evolution of the web-feeding trend using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Even though no clear correlation between the quiescent galaxy fraction of galaxy clusters and the significance of LSSs around them is found in the simulation, we verify that the quiescent galaxy fractions of infallers such as groups ($M_{200} \geq 10^{12}$ \SI{}{M_{\odot}}) and galaxies ($M_{200} &lt; 10^{12}$ \SI{}{M_{\odot}}) is smaller than the quiescent fraction of cluster members and that infallers can lower the quiescent fraction of clusters. These results imply that cluster-to-cluster variations of quiescent galaxy fraction at $z \leq 1$ can at least partially be explained by feeding materials through cosmic webs to clusters.</description>

      <title>Tracing Hierarchical Star Formation out to Kiloparsec Scales in Nearby Spiral Galaxies with UVIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds fragment under the action of supersonic turbulence &amp; gravity which results in a scale-free hierarchical distribution of star formation (SF) within galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the hierarchical distribution of SF in nearby galaxies shows a dependence on host galaxy properties. In this context, we study the nature of hierarchical SF from a few tens of pc up to several kpc in 4 nearby spiral galaxies NGC1566, NGC5194, NGC5457 &amp; NGC7793, by leveraging the large FoV &amp; high resolution FUV+NUV observations from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). Using the two-point correlation function, we infer that the young star-forming clumps (SFCs) in the galaxies are arranged in a fractal-like hierarchical distribution, but only up to a maximum scale ($l_{corr}$) &amp; it ranges from 0.5 kpc to 3.1 kpc. The flocculent spiral NGC7793 has $\sim$5 times smaller $l_{corr}$ than the 3 grand design spirals, possibly due to its lower mass, low pressure environment &amp; lack of strong spiral arms. $l_{corr}$ being much smaller than the galaxy size suggests that the SF hierarchy does not extend to the full galaxy size &amp; it is likely an effect set by multiple physical mechanisms in the galaxy. The hierarchical distribution of SFCs dissipates within 10 to 50 Myr, signifying their migration away from their birthplaces over time. Our results suggest that the global hierarchical properties of SF in galaxies are not universal &amp; significant variations exist in the local &amp; global hierarchy parameters of a galaxy. This study also demonstrates the capabilities of UVIT in characterizing the SF hierarchy in nearby galaxies. In the future, a bigger sample can be employed to further understand the role of large-scale galaxy properties (morphology, environment) &amp; physical processes (feedback, turbulence, shear &amp; ISM conditions) on determining the non-universal hierarchical properties of SF in galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We present a sample of 398 galaxies with ionized gas outflow signatures in their spectra from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey Data Release 4, including 45 low-mass galaxies with stellar masses $M_*&lt;10^{10}$ $M_\odot$. We assemble our sample by systematically searching for the presence of a second velocity component in the [O III]$\lambda\lambda 4959, 5007$ doublet emission line in 39,612 galaxies with redshifts $z&lt;0.3$. The host galaxies are classified using the BPT diagram, with $\sim$89% identified as AGNs and composites and 11% as star-forming (SF) galaxies. The outflows are typically faster in AGNs with a median velocity of 936 km s$^{-1}$ compared to 655 km s$^{-1}$ in the SF objects. Of particular interest are the 45 galaxies in the low-mass range, of which a third are classified as AGNs/composites. The outflows from the low-mass AGNs are also faster and more blueshifted compared to those in the low-mass SF galaxies. This indicates that black hole outflows can affect host galaxies in the low-mass range and that AGN feedback in galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^{10}$ $ M_\odot$ should be considered in galaxy evolution models.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>On the Orbital Effects of Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Ejected Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense stellar clusters surround the supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Interactions within the cluster can alter the stellar orbits, occasionally driving a star into the SMBH's tidal radius where it becomes ruptured. This proof-of-concept study examines the orbital effects of stellar collisions using a semianalytic model. Both low and high speed collisions occur in the SMBH's sphere of influence. Our model treats stars in low speed collisions as sticky spheres. For high-speed collisions, we develop a simple prescription based on the limiting case of a hyperbolic encounter. We test a range of collision treatments and cluster conditions. We find that collisions can place stars on nearly radial orbits. Depositing stars within the tidal radius, collisions may drive the disruption of stars with unusual masses and structures: depending on the nature of the collision, the star could be the product of a recent merger, or it could have lost its outer layers in a high speed impact, appearing as a stripped star. We also find that high speed collisions near the periapsis of an eccentric orbit can unbind stars from the SMBH. However, dissipation during these high-speed collisions can substantially reduce the number of unbound stars achieved in our simulations. We conclude that TDEs and ejected stars, even in the hypervelocity regime, are plausible outcomes of stellar collisions, though their frequency in a three-dimensional nuclear star cluster are uncertain. Future work will address the rates and properties of these events.</description>

      <title>LOFAR Deep Fields: Probing the sub-mJy regime of polarized extragalactic sources in ELAIS-N1. II. Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep polarization surveys at low radio frequencies are key to cosmic magnetism studies: Larger catalogs of polarized extragalactic sources and increased precision on Faraday rotation measures (RMs) make it possible to probe the magneto-ionic medium along the lines of sight of the sources and to construct denser RM grids. In a first paper, we presented a search for polarized sources in deep observations of the 25 square degree area of the European Large Area ISO Survey North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in the range 114.9 to 177.4 MHz. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the polarized radio galaxies and use the catalog to produce an RM grid of the field. After identifying the host galaxies and collecting redshift information, we characterized the radio galaxies in terms of their radio morphologies, rest frame radio luminosities, and linear sizes. We calculated residual rotation measures (RRMs) by removing the Galactic RM and studied the variation in the RRMs with redshift and degree of polarization. We produced an RRM grid of the field and compared the positions of the polarized sources with those of galaxy clusters and superclusters. The radio galaxies show a variety of morphologies, including diffuse emission; Fanaroff Riley type II sources make up about half of the sample. Using available multiband catalogs, we found redshifts for the hosts of all polarized sources in the range of 0.06 to 1.9. Polarized emission is detected mainly from large radio galaxies. The RRM values have a median close to zero, and they appear to be independent of redshift and degree of polarization. The sources in the lines of sight of clusters of galaxies and of a supercluster are indistinguishable in their polarization and RRM properties from the population of sources that are not behind these structures.</description>

      <title>Local variations of the radial metallicity gradient in a simulated NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue and their implications for (extra-)galactic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial metallicity gradients are fundamental to understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In our high-resolution simulation of a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue, we analyze the linearity, scatter, spatial coherence, and age-related variations of metallicity gradients using young stars and gas. While a global linear model generally captures the gradient, it ever so slightly overestimates metallicity in the inner galaxy and underestimates it in the outer regions of our simulated galaxy. Both a quadratic model, showing an initially steeper gradient that smoothly flattens outward, and a piecewise linear model with a break radius at 10~kpc (2.5 effective radii) fit the data equally better. The spread of [Fe/H] of young stars in the simulation increases by tenfold from the innermost to the outer galaxy at a radius of 20~kpc. We find that stars born at similar times along radial spirals drive this spread in the outer galaxy, with a chemical under- and over-enhancement of up to 0.1 dex at leading and trailing regions of such spirals, respectively. This localised chemical variance highlights the need to examine radial and azimuthal selection effects for both Galactic and extragalactic observational studies. The arguably idealised but volume-complete simulations suggest that future studies should not only test linear and piecewise linear gradients, but also non-linear functions such as quadratic ones to test for a smooth gradient rather than one with a break radius. Either finding would help to determine the importance of different enrichment or mixing pathways and thus our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Investigations of MWISP Filaments. I. Filament Identification and Analysis Algorithms, and Source Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments play a crucial role in providing the necessary environmental conditions for star formation, actively participating in the process. To facilitate the identification and analysis of filaments, we introduce DPConCFil (Directional and Positional Consistency between Clumps and Filaments), a suite of algorithms comprising one identification method and two analysis methods. The first method, the consistency-based identification approach, uses directional and positional consistency among neighboring clumps and local filament axes to identify filaments in the PPV datacube. The second method employs a graph-based skeletonization technique to extract the filament intensity skeletons. The third method, a graph-based substructuring approach, allows the decomposition of complex filaments into simpler sub-filaments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPConCFil by applying the identification method to the clumps detected in the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey dataset by FacetClumps, successfully identifying a batch of filaments across various scales within $10^{\circ} \leq l \leq 20^{\circ}$, $-5.25^{\circ} \leq b \leq 5.25^{\circ}$ and -200 km s$^{-1}$ $\leq v \leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$. Subsequently, we apply the analysis methods to the identified filaments, presenting a catalog with basic parameters and conducting statistics of their galactic distribution and properties. DPConCFil is openly available on GitHub, accompanied by a manual.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of hot intragroup medium in optically selected, poor galaxy groups by eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last several decades, extensive research has been conducted on the baryon cycles within cosmic structures, encompassing a broad mass range from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. However, a notable gap in understanding the cosmic baryon cycle is the poor galaxy groups with halo masses around $10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$ (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2010). Poor galaxy groups, like our own Local Group, are prevalent throughout the universe, yet robust detection of their hot, X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGrM) has remained elusive. The presence of this hot IGrM is crucial for addressing the long-standing "missing baryons" problem. Previous ROSAT-based studies were limited by a small number of X-ray bright samples, thus restricting the scope of their findings. Here we show a robust detection of this hot IGrM in a large, optically selected poor groups sample, based on the stacked X-ray images from the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. These groups are identified in DESI LS with a mass range of log($M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) = 11.5-13.5 and a redshift range of z = 0.1-0.5. Additionally, our results indicate that despite its presence in virtually groups at all sizes, this gas component is still not sufficient to recover the universal baryon fraction, and hence the "missing baryons" problem still persists in poor galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Analysis of metal-poor galaxy spectra in the redshift range 0.00574-0.05368</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the metal-poor galaxy spectra in the redshift range 0.00574$\leq$z$\leq$0.05368 which were reported by Nakajima et al (2022) in their EMPG (extreme metal poor galaxy) sample. The models account for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the starburst (SB) galaxies, for accretion and ejection, for the physical parameters and the element abundances. The results are obtained in particular for the two cases, the emitting nebula is ejected outward from the galaxy radiation source (RS) and the emitting nebula is accreted towards the RS. We adopt the code {\sc suma} which allows to choose the direction of the clouds relative to the RS. The modelling results which reproduce a single galaxy spectrum with the highest precision allow to classify this object as an AGN ejecting, an AGN accreting, an SB ejecting or an SB accreting type. When more models are equally valid we suggest that the galaxy is the product of merging. Our results show that among the eleven sample galaxies five are such. We focus on the N/O trends with the oxygen metallicity and with the redshift to identify the nitrogen/oxygen relative formation processes and the process-rates, respectively, for intermediate-mass stars. Our results show that O/H relative abundances calculated for the sample galaxies are lower than solar by a factor $\leq$5. Yet, a few values were found above solar. He/H were calculated lower than solar by factors $\leq$ 100 and N/H by factors $\leq$135.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the extremely diffuse stellar distribution of Nube galaxy through fuzzy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed an unusual stellar distribution within the almost dark dwarf galaxy Nube. The galaxy exhibits a remarkably flat stellar distribution, with an effective radius of approximately 6.9 kpc, exceeding the typical size of dwarf galaxies and even surpassing that of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with similar stellar masses. The dynamical heating effect of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) may offer an explanation for this extremely diffuse stellar distribution in Nube. In this research, we utilize simulation techniques to investigate this issue and find that a particle mass $\mathcal{O} (1)\times 10^{-23}$ eV offers a plausible explanation for this peculiar stellar distribution anomaly.</description>

      <title>The ionizing photon production efficiency of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 4-10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the ionizing emission of star-forming galaxies is critical to understanding their contribution to reionization and their impact on the surrounding environment. The number of ionizing photons available to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies but also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons ($\xi_{ion}$). We aim to estimate the $\xi_{ion}$ using Balmer lines in a sample of 731 galaxies at $4\leq z \leq 10$ selected from different JWST surveys. We used the available HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to determine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a delayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec spectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities and then constrained $\xi_{ion}$ values after dust correction. We find a mean value of 10$^{25.23}$Hz erg$^{-1}$ for $\xi_{ion}$ in the sample with an observed scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of $\xi_{ion}$ which confirms the redshift evolution of $\xi_{ion}$ found in other works. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of $\xi_{ion}$ with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of $\xi_{ion}$ with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing UV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR are also efficient producers. We also investigated the relation of $\xi_{ion}$ with the EW([OIII]$\lambda$5007) and find that galaxies with the higher EW([OIII]) are the more efficient producers of ionizing photons. Similarly, we find that galaxies with higher O32 ratios and lower gas-phase metallicities (based on the R23 calibration) show higher $\xi_{ion}$ values.</description>

      <title>Lensed fast radio bursts as a probe of time-varying gravitational potential induced by wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic wave dark matter (DM) is preponderantly contesting the conventional cold DM paradigm in predicting diverse and rich phenomena on small scales. For a DM halo made of ultralight bosons, the wave interference naturally induces slow de Broglie time-scale fluctuations of the gravitational potential. In this paper, we first derive an estimation for the effect of a time-varying gravitational potential on photon propagation. Our numerical simulations suggest that the time-varying potential of a $10^{11}M_{\odot}$ halo composed of $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$ bosons would stretch or compress a time series signal by a factor of $10^{-10}$. Here, we propose that, due to the precise measurements of their arrival times, lensed repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) have the potential to effectively validate temporal variations in gravitational potential by monitoring their images over a period of approximately $\mathcal{O}(1)$ years. With rapidly growing FRB observations, this method would serve as a promising method to directly probe the wave nature of galactic DM halos.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Study of the Reactions of Ground State Atomic Carbon and Oxygen with Nitrogen Dioxide over the 50-296 K Temperature Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetics of the reactions of nitrogen dioxide, NO$_2$, with atomic oxygen and atomic carbon in their ground triplet states ($^3$P) have been studied at room temperature and below using a supersonic flow (Laval nozzle) reactor. O($^3$P) and C($^3$P) atoms (hereafter O and C respectively) were created in-situ by the pulsed laser photolysis of the precursor molecules NO$_2$ at 355 nm and CBr$_4$ at 266 nm respectively. While the progress of the O + NO$_2$ reaction was followed by detecting O atoms by a chemiluminescent tracer method, progress of the C + NO$_2$ reaction was followed by detecting C atoms directly by vacuum ultra violet laser induced fluorescence at 116 nm. The measured rate constants for the O + NO$_2$ reaction are found to be in excellent agreement with earlier work at higher temperatures and extend the available kinetic data for this process down to 50 K. The present work represents the first kinetics study of the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although both reactions display rate constants that increase as the temperature falls, a more substantial rate increase is observed for the O + NO$_2$ reaction. The effects of these reactions on the simulated abundances of interstellar NO$_2$ and related compounds were tested using a gas-grain model of the dense interstellar medium, employing expressions for the rate constants of the form, $k(T) = \alpha(T/300)^\beta$, with $\alpha = 1 \times 10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and $\beta = -0.65$ for the O + NO$_2$ reaction and $\alpha = 2 \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and $\beta = -0.11$ for the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although these simulations predict that gas-phase NO$_2$ abundances are low in dense interstellar clouds, NO$_2$ abundances on interstellar dust grains are predicted to reach reasonably high levels, indicating the potential for detection of this species in warmer regions.</description>

      <title>NGC3521 as the Milky Way analogue: spectral energy distributon from UV to Radio and photometric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the multiwavelength properties of NGC 3521, the Milky Way galaxy-twin, from UV- to radio, exploring the data from GALEX for UV-, SDSS for optical, 2MASS, WISE, MIPS (Spitzer) and PACS, SPIRE (Herschel) for IR-, and NRAO VLA for radio ranges. To obtain the spectral energy distribution (SED), we exploited the CIGALE software and constructed SEDs without (model A) and with (model B) AGN module. The type of nuclear activity of NGC 3521 is confirmed as the LINER. We also present the results of the photometric data processing. Exploring the ZTF observations in 2018-2024, we found, for the first time, a weak photometric variability of the nuclear activity, where the correlation between g-r color indices and g-magnitude for long-term timescale shows a BWB trend (bluer-when-brighter) with a Pearson coefficient r(g-r)=0.56, which is a medium correlation. To detect the variability of NGC 3521 during the day (IDV), we provided observations using a Zeiss-600 telescope with an aperture size of 8" at the Terskol observatory. The data obtained in the R-filter with an exposure of 90 sec for three hours on Feb 11, 2022, serve in favor of a trend towards an increase in brightness with the amplitude of variability of 0.04 +- 0.001 mag. According to the results of the simulations, the best fit to the observed SED is provided by model A, which considers the contribution to the radiation from all galaxy components, assuming that the galaxy nucleus is inactive. Within this model, we derived the stellar mass M$_{star}$ = 2.13 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, the dust mass M$_{dust}$ = 8.45 * 10$^{7} M_{Sun}$, and the star formation rate SFR = 1.76 $M_{Sun}$ * yr$^{-1}$ with $\chi^{2}$/d.o.f = 1.8. Also, based on the HIPASS radio data, we estimated the mass of neutral hydrogen to be M$_{HI}$ = 1.3 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, which is an order of magnitude greater than the mass of the stellar component.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: External-Pressure-Confined Dense Cores and Salpeter-like Core Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) observations of dense cores in three massive molecular clouds within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, including the Dust Ridge cloud e, Sgr C, and the 20 km s-1 cloud, at a spatial resolution of 2000 au. Among the 834 cores identified from the 1.3 mm continuum, we constrain temperatures and linewidths of 253 cores using local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) methods to fit the H2CO and/or CH3CN spectra. We determine their masses using the 1.3 mm dust continuum and derived temperatures, and then evaluate their virial parameters using the H2CO and/or CH3CN linewidths and construct the core mass functions (CMFs). We find that the contribution of external pressure is crucial for the virial equilibrium of the dense cores in the three clouds, which contrasts with the environment in the Galactic disk where dense cores are already bound even without the contribution of external pressure. We also find that the CMFs show a Salpeter-like slope in the high-mass (&gt;~3-6 Msun) end, a change from previous works with our new temperature estimates. Combined with the possible top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in the CMZ, our result suggests that gas accretion and further fragmentation may play important roles in transforming the CMF to the IMF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews the three-dimensional structure, age, kinematics, and chemistry of the Milky Way (MW) region within ~2 kpc from its center (hereafter referred to as the 'bulge') from an observational perspective. While not exhaustive in citations, this review provides historical context and discusses the main controversies and limitations in the current consensus. The nuclear bulge region, within $\sim$200 pc from the Galactic center, has been excluded from this review. This very complex region, hosting dense molecular clouds and active star formation, would deserve a dedicated paper.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the UV slope of galaxies at cosmic morning (z &gt; 4): the properties of extremely blue galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the UV continuum slope, beta, using a sample of 733 galaxies selected from a mixture of JWST ERS/GTO/GO observational programs and with z &gt; 4. We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution PRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV we find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34), consistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous works. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at high redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope. Furthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as beta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous results that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select a sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta &lt; -2.6): such slopes are steeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free, young, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is included. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the possible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample of redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have younger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust attenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to red galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta values. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most recent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc &gt; 10% in at least 25% of XBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum contribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty star-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.</description>

      <title>NGC 628 in SIGNALS: Explaining the Abundance-Ionization Correlation in HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variations of oxygen abundance and ionization parameter in HII regions are usually thought to be the dominant factors that produced variations seen in observed emission line spectra. However, if and how these two quantities are physically related is hotly debated in the literature. Using emission line data of NGC 628 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we use a suite of photoionization models to constrain the abundance and ionization parameters for over 1500 HII regions throughout its disk. We measure an anti-correlation between these two properties, consistent with expectations, although with considerable scatter. Secondary trends with dust extinction and star formation rate surface density potentially explain the large scatter observed. We raise concerns throughout regarding various modeling assumptions and their impact on the observed correlations presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Pairs in Cosmic Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of different astrophysical properties of a sample of galaxy pairs in cosmic voids. The sample consists of 72 galaxy pairs with projected separations and relative radial velocities rp&lt;100 h$^{-1}$kpc, $\Delta V &lt;$ 500 kms$^{-1}$ in the redshift range z&lt;0.1. The different results for this pair sample are compared to those derived for matched samples configured in absolute magnitude, stellar mass and concentration residing in void wall and global averaged environments. We find that pair galaxies in voids tend to have bluer optical colors than the corresponding galaxies in wall an field, regardless of their stellar mass and concentration, which indicates a more recent formation of the bulk of stars. We also obtain larger mid--IR colors for the void paired galaxies with respect to the corresponding matched samples in the wall and in field environments. However, we find significantly larger differences for galaxies with high mass and concentration. We also notice that mid--IR color--color diagram shows void pair members consistent with the locus of star--forming galaxies, in contrast with the other environments that exhibit a bimodal behavior comprising both passive and star--forming objects. The D$_n$(4000) parameter also shows a significant younger stellar population in paired galaxies in voids. This is also reflected in the higher star formation rate values, which show a larger efficiency for void paired galaxies. We notice that the star formation efficiency is larger for void paired galaxies with high stellar mass and concentration. We also find that the efficiency of star formation associated to galaxy interactions is significantly larger in pairs residing in cosmic voids. This larger star formation activity could be associated to both the expected richer gas environment and a more gentle dynamical behavior typical of void environments.</description>

      <title>The Globular Cluster System of the Virgo Cluster Ultradiffuse Galaxy VCC 615</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the globular cluster system of the Virgo Cluster ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG) VCC 615. We select globular cluster candidates through a combination of size and color, while simultaneously rejecting contamination from background galaxies that would be unresolved in ground-based imaging. Our sample of globular cluster candidates is essentially complete down to a limiting magnitude of F814W=24.0, approximately 90% down the globular cluster luminosity function. We estimate a total globular cluster population for VCC 615 of $N_{\rm GC}=25.1^{+6.5}_{-5.4}$, resulting in a specific frequency of $S_N=55.5^{+14.5}_{-12.0}$, quite high compared to normal galaxies of similar luminosity, but consistent with the large specific frequencies found in some other UDGs. The abundant cluster population suggests the galaxy is enshrouded by a massive dark halo, consistent with previous dynamical mass estimates using globular cluster kinematics. While the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function appears slightly brighter than expected (by approximately 0.3-0.5 mag), this difference is comparable to the 0.3 mag uncertainty in the measurement, and we see no sign of an extremely luminous population of clusters similar to those detected in the UDGs NGC1054-DF2 and -DF4. However, we do find a relatively high fraction ($32^{+5}_{-4}$%) of large clusters with half-light radii greater than 9 pc. The galaxy's offset nucleus appears photometrically distinct from the globular clusters, and is more akin to ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs) in Virgo. Over time, VCC 615's already diffuse stellar body may be further stripped by cluster tides, leaving the nucleus intact to form a new Virgo UCD.</description>

      <title>The Jet Paths of Radio AGN and their Cluster Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied bent radio sources within X-ray galaxy groups in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields, using radio data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Explorations data release 1 (MIGHTEE-DR1) at 1.2-1.3 GHz (angular resolutions of 8.9" and 5"; &lt;rms&gt; ~ 3.5 and 5.5 uJy/beam). Bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) were identified via visual inspection. Our analysis included 19 bent radio AGN in the COSMOS field and 17 in the XMM-LSS field which lie within X-ray galaxy groups (2x10^13 &gt;= M200c/Msun = 3x10^14). We investigated the relationship between their bending angle (BA) - the angle formed by the jets or lobes of two-sided radio sources associated with AGN - and properties of their host galaxies and large-scale environment probed by the X-ray galaxy groups. Our key findings are: a) In the XMM-LSS field, we observed a strong correlation between the linear projected size of the bent AGN, the group halo mass, and the projected distance from the group centre. This trend, consistent with previous studies, was not detected in the COSMOS sample. b) The BA is a function of environmental density, with the type of medium playing a significant role. Additionally, at z &lt;= 0.5 we found a higher number of bent sources (BA &lt;= 160deg) compared to higher redshifts (z ~ 1), by a factor of &gt;1.5. This trend aligns with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which suggest that denser environments and longer interaction times at lower redshifts contribute to this effect. Comparison with the literature suggests that jet bending in galaxy groups within the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 is primarily driven by ram pressure exerted on the jets, which occurs during quiescent phases of AGN activity. This study underscores the role of environmental interactions in shaping the morphology of radio AGN within galaxy groups, providing insights into the interplay between large-scale structure and AGN physics.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Supermassive Black Holes from Pop III.1 Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a key open question for contemporary astrophysics and cosmology. Here we review the features of a cosmological model of SMBH formation from Pop III.1 seeds, i.e., remnants of metal-free stars forming in locally-isolated minihalos, where energy injection from dark matter particle annihilation alters the structure of the protostar allowing growth to supermassive scales (Banik et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2023; Cammelli et al. 2024). The Pop III.1 model explains the paucity of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) via a characteristic SMBH seed mass of $\sim10^5\:M_\odot$ that is set by the baryonic content of minihalos. Ionization feedback from supermassive Pop III.1 stars sets the cosmic number density of SMBHs to be $n_{\rm SMBH}\lesssim 0.2\:{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. The model then predicts that all SMBHs form by $z\sim20$ with a spatial distribution that is initially unclustered. SMBHs at high redshifts $z\gtrsim7$ should all be single objects, with SMBH binaries and higher order multiples emerging only at lower redshifts. We also discuss the implications of this model for SMBH host galaxy properties, occupation fractions, gravitational wave emission, cosmic reionization, and the nature of dark matter. These predictions are compared to latest observational results, especially from HST, JWST and pulsar timing array observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic strings using large-volume hydrodynamical simulations in the context of JWST's massive UV-bright galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered an unexpectedly large abundance of massive, UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, presenting a significant challenge to established galaxy formation models within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Cosmic strings, predicted by a wide range of particle physics theories beyond the Standard Model, provide a promising potential explanation for these observations. They may act as additional gravitational seeds in the early universe, enhancing the process of high-redshift structure formation, potentially resulting in a more substantial population of massive, efficiently star-forming galaxies. We numerically investigate this prediction in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO and the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We evaluate the simulation results in the context of recent JWST data and find that sufficiently energetic cosmic strings produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions that are in slightly to substantially better agreement with observations at high redshifts. Moreover, we observe that the halos seeded by cosmic strings exhibit a greater efficiency of star formation and enhanced central concentrations. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the simulations incorporating cosmic strings converge with those from a baseline $\Lambda$CDM model by redshift $z \sim 6$. This convergence suggests that the modified cosmological framework effectively replicates the successful predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at lower redshifts, where observational constraints are significantly stronger. Our results provide compelling evidence that cosmic strings may play a crucial role in explaining the galaxy properties observed by JWST at high redshifts while maintaining consistency with well-established models at later epochs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using sonification on scientific data analysis provides additional dimensions to visualization, potentially increasing researchers' analytical capabilities and fostering inclusion and accessibility. This research explores the potential of multimodal Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) applied to galaxy analysis through the development and evaluation of a tool that complements the visualization of datacubes with sound. The proposed application, \textit{ViewCube}, provides interactive visualizations and sonifications of spectral information across a two-dimensional field-of-view, and its architecture is designed to incorporate future sonification approaches. The first sonification implementation described in this article uses a deep learning module to generate binaural unsupervised auditory representations. The work includes a qualitative and quantitative user study based on an online questionnaire, aimed at both specialized and non-specialized participants, focusing on the case study of datacubes of galaxies from the Calar Alto Integral Field Spectroscopy Area (CALIFA) survey. Out of 67 participants who completed the questionnaire, 42 had the opportunity to test the application in person prior to filling out the online survey. 81\% of these 42 participants expressed the good interactive response of the tool, 79.1\% of the complete sample found the application "Useful", and 58.2\% rated its aesthetics as "Good". The quantitative results suggest that all participants were able to retrieve information from the sonifications, pointing to previous experience in the analysis of sound events as more helpful than previous knowledge of the data for the proposed tasks, and highlighting the importance of training and attention to detail for the understanding of complex auditory information.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation: TBD. The impact of line-of-sight projections on the covariance between galaxy cluster multi-wavelength observable properties -- insights from hydrodynamic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster cosmology can benefit from combining multi-wavelength studies, which can benefit from characterising the correlation coefficients between different mass-observable relations. In this work, we aim to provide information on the scatter, the skewness, and the covariance of various mass-observable relations in galaxy clusters in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. This information will help future analyses to better tackle accretion histories and projection effects and model mass observable relations for cosmology studies.We identify galaxy clusters in Magneticum Box2b simulations with mass $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{14} {\rm M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=0.24$ and $z=0.90$. Our analysis includes \Euclid-derived properties such as richness, stellar mass, lensing mass, and concentration. Additionally, we investigate complementary multi-wavelength data, including X-ray luminosity, integrated Compton-$y$ parameter, gas mass, and temperature. The impact of projection effects on mass-observable residuals and correlations is then examined. At intermediate redshift ($z=0.24$), projection effects impact lensing concentration, richness, and gas mass the most in terms of scatter and skewness of log-residuals of scaling relations. The contribution of projection effects can be significant enough to boost a spurious hot- vs. cold-baryons correlation and consequently hide underlying correlations due to halo accretion histories.
  At high redshift ($z=0.9$), the richness has a much lower scatter (of log-residuals), and the quantity that is most impacted by projection effects is the lensing mass.
  Lensing concentration reconstruction, in particular, is affected by deviations of the reduced-shear profile shape from the one derived by an NFW profile rather than interlopers in the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES): IV. An observational run-up of the third r-process peak with Hf, Os, Ir, and Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third r-process peak (Os, Ir, Pt) is poorly understood due to observational challenges, with spectral lines located in the blue or near-ultraviolet region of stellar spectra. These challenges need to be overcome for a better understanding of the r-process in a broader context. To understand how the abundances of the third r-process peak are synthesised and evolve in the Universe, a homogeneous chemical analysis of metal-poor stars using high quality data observed in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum (&lt; 400 nm) is necessary. We provide a homogeneous set of abundances for the third r-process peak (Os, Ir, Pt) and Hf, increasing by up to one order of magnitude their availability in the literature. A classical 1D, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis of four elements (Hf, Os, Ir, Pt) is performed, using ATLAS model atmospheres to fit synthetic spectra in high resolution (&gt; 40,000), high signal-to-noise ratio, of 52 red giants observed with UVES/VLT. Due to the heavy line blending involved, a careful determination of upper limits and uncertainties is done. The observational results are compared with state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis models. Our sample displays larger abundances of Ir (Z=77) in comparison to Os (Z=76), which have been measured in a few stars in the past. The results also suggest decoupling between abundances of third r-process peak elements with respect to Eu (rare earth element) in Eu-poor stars. This seems to contradict a co-production scenario of Eu and the third r-process peak elements Os, Ir, and Pt in the progenitors of these objects. Our results are challenging to explain from the nucleosynthetic point of view: the observationally derived abundances indicate the need for an additional early, primary formation channel (or a non-robust r-process).</description>

      <title>An ALMA spectroscopic survey of the Planck high-redshift object PLCK G073.4-57.5 confirms two protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00294</link>

Abstract: Planck observed the whole sky between 350um and 3mm, discovering thousands of unresolved peaks in the cosmic infrared background. The nature of these peaks are still poorly understood - while some are strong gravitational lenses, the majority are spatial overdensities of star-forming galaxies, but with almost no redshift constraints. PLCK G073.4-57.5 (G073) is one of these Planck-selected peaks. G073 was previously observed by ALMA, with the results suggesting the presence of two structures (one around redshift 1.5 and one around redshift 2) aligned along the line of sight, but the results lacked robust spectroscopic confirmation. Characterizing the full redshift distribution of the galaxies within G073 is needed in order to better understand this representative example of these objects, and connect them to the emergence of galaxy clusters. We use ALMA spectral scans to search for CO and CI(1-0) line emission, targeting eight red Herschel-SPIRE sources in the field and four bright SCUBA-2 sources. We find 15 emission lines in 13 galaxies, and we secure the spectroscopic redshifts of all 13 galaxies. 11 of these galaxies are SPIRE-selected and lie in two structures at z=1.53 and z=2.31, while the two SCUBA-2-selected galaxies are at z=2.61. Using multiwavelength photometry we constrain stellar masses and star-formation rates, and using the CO and CI emission lines we constrain gas masses. Our protocluster galaxies exhibit typical depletion timescales compared to field galaxies at the same redshifts, but enhanced gas-to-stellar mass ratios, potentially driven by emission line selection effects. We find that the two structures confirmed in our survey are reproduced in cosmological simulations of star-forming halos at high redshift; the simulated halos have a 60-70% probability of collapsing into galaxy clusters, implying that the two structures in G073 are genuinely protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of Dust Emission in the Young Edge-on Protostellar Disk HH 212</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, since the continuum emission of the disk is more contaminated by the free-free emission at longer wavelengths, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk.</description>

Abstract: Eclipsing binaries (EBs) play an important astrophysical role in studying stellar properties and evolution. By analyzing photometric data in the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey field, RA: $23^h$$01^m$$51.00^s$, Dec: +34$^\circ$36$^\prime$45$^{\prime \prime}$, 48 EBs are detected and 2 are newly discovered. This specific field has been observed 52 times by the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR 9, which facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the EBs. For EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, radial velocity curves were obtained, and their precise orbital parameters were determined by simultaneously analyzing photometric light curves and radial velocity curves. For the other EBs with only photometric light curves, we used the q-search or the temperature ratio method to determine their initial mass ratios and then determined the orbital parameters. It is found that 15 EBs belong to detached systems, 1 to semi-detached systems, and 32 to contact systems. Based on the O-C analysis for 26 EBs with sufficient eclipsing times, we found a long-term decrease in the orbital period of 11 EBs and a continuous increase of 5 EBs, which are due to the material transfer between the two components. The O-C curve of 1 EB shows a distinct periodic variation, which is caused by the light travel time effect, and the third body is likely to be a black hole. By applying the spectral subtraction method to 13 EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, 10 systems exhibit distinct H$\alpha$ emission lines, in which 1 system exhibits double-peaked lines near phases 0.25 and 0.75, implying strong chromospheric activity. In the mass-luminosities and mass-radius distributions, most of the more massive components are less evolved than the less massive ones.</description>

      <title>Disk-Locking Regulates Stellar Rotation in Young Clusters: Insights from NGC 2264</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many young clusters possess extended main sequences, a phenomenon commonly ascribed to stellar rotation. However, the mechanism behind their very wide stellar rotation distributions remains unclear. A proposed explanation is that magnetic star-disk interaction can regulate stellar rotation, i.e., protostars with longer disk lifetimes will eventually evolve into slow rotators, and vice versa. To examine this hypothesis, we took the star forming region, NGC 2264, as a test bed. We have studied its high-mass pre-main-sequence and zero-age main-sequence stars. We found that on average, disk-less pre-main-sequence stars rotate faster than their disk-bearing counterparts. The stellar rotation distribution of its zero-age main-sequence stars is similar to evolved young clusters. We conclude that disk-locking may play a crucial role in the rotational velocity distribution of intermediate-mass early-type stars. We suggest that the observed wide stellar rotation distribution in many young clusters can occur in their early stages.</description>

      <title>Adding RR Lyrae $y$-Band Template Light Curves to gatspy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complement the $y$-band template light curves for RR Lyrae to the well-established template light curves in the $ugriz$-band, where the latter have been adopted in the astroML/gatspy python package as one of the period-search methods for RR Lyrae. These $y$-band template light curves were constructed based on the $z$-band time series data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the $y$-band light curves from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and dedicated $y$-band observations using the Lulin One-meter Telescope for RR Lyrae located in the SDSS Stripe 82 region. These $y$-band template light curves, 9 for the ab-type RR Lyrae and 3 for the c-type RR Lyrae, can be applied in conjunction to the $ugriz$-band template light curves for upcoming sky surveys involving the $y$-band, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>Percent-level timing of reionization: self-consistent, implicit-likelihood inference from XQR-30+ Ly$\alpha$ forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyman alpha (Lya) forest in the spectra of z&gt;5 quasars provides a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). With the recent advent of exquisite datasets such as XQR-30, many models have struggled to reproduce the observed large-scale fluctuations in the Lya opacity. Here we introduce a Bayesian analysis framework that forward-models large-scale lightcones of IGM properties, and accounts for unresolved sub-structure in the Lya opacity by calibrating to higher-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Our models directly connect physically-intuitive galaxy properties with the corresponding IGM evolution, without having to tune "effective" parameters or calibrate out the mean transmission. The forest data, in combination with UV luminosity functions and the CMB optical depth, are able to constrain global IGM properties at percent level precision in our fiducial model. Unlike many other works, we recover the forest observations without evoking a rapid drop in the ionizing emissivity from z~7 to 5.5, which we attribute to our sub-grid model for recombinations. In this fiducial model, reionization ends at $z=5.44\pm0.02$ and the EoR mid-point is at $z=7.7\pm0.1$. The ionizing escape fraction increases towards faint galaxies, showing a mild redshift evolution at fixed UV magnitude, Muv. Half of the ionizing photons are provided by galaxies fainter than Muv~-12, well below direct detection limits of optical/NIR instruments including JWST. We also show results from an alternative galaxy model that does not allow for a redshift evolution in the ionizing escape fraction. Despite being decisively disfavored by the Bayesian evidence, the posterior of this model is in qualitative agreement with that from our fiducial model. We caution however that our conclusions regarding the early stages of the EoR and which sources reionized the Universe are more model-dependent.</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with optical survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>

      <title>Chemical Complexity and Prevalence of Life in the Universe: A New Method for the Estimation of Key Terms of Drake Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I describe a new method of estimating the prevalence of life in the Universe, based on the fact that more chemically complex environments are more rare. The paper makes three main claims: (1) There is a statistically significant (inverse) relationship between chemical complexity (quantified as the number of different types of molecules present in a given environment) and mass fraction for the successively smaller environments in the hierarchy of cosmic matter (extragalactic medium, interstellar clouds, dense cores, planetary systems, their icy fraction etc.) that is well described by a logarithmic law. (2) Minimal chemical complexity of life can be roughly defined, based on existing studies in vitro and in silico, both bottom-up (designing increasingly complex chemical systems) and top-down (simplifying minimal organisms). (3) Thus, one can estimate the fraction of the total mass density of the Universe that resides in reservoirs of chemical complexity estimated as being minimal for life. This is then translated, through simple statistical models of planetary systems, into the number of planets in a single Milky Way-sized galaxy that have, on their surface, reservoirs of biogenic chemical complexity. Two best models give the estimates of 1.6 (more complex minimal life) and 1.3e4 (slightly less complex minimal life) as the predicted upper bound for the number of instances of life per our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Using Binary Population Synthesis to Examine the Impact of Binary Evolution on the C, N, O, and $S$-Process Yields of Solar-Metallicity Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a significant role in our understanding of the origin of the elements. They contribute to the abundances of C, N, and approximately $50\%$ of the abundances of the elements heavier than iron. An aspect often neglected in studies of AGB stars is the impact of a stellar companion on AGB stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we update the stellar abundances of AGB stars in the binary population synthesis code \textsc{binary\_c} and calibrate our treatment of the third dredge-up using observations of Galactic carbon stars. We model stellar populations of low- to intermediate-mass stars at solar-metallicity and examine the stellar wind contributions to C, N, O, Sr, Ba, and Pb yields at binary fractions between 0 and 1. For a stellar population with a binary fraction of 0.7, we find $\sim 20-25\%$ less C and $s$-process elements ejected than from a population composed of only single stars, and we find little change in the N and O yields. We also compare our models with observed abundances from Ba stars and find our models can reproduce most Ba star abundances, but our population estimates a higher frequency of Ba stars with a surface [Ce/Y] &gt; $+0.2\,$dex. Our models also predict the rare existence of Ba stars with masses $&gt; 10 \text{M}\,_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Masses of Red Giants in the Galactic Globular Clusters M9 &amp; M19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismic masses of globular cluster (GC) stars are invaluable to investigate stellar evolution. Previously, only two GCs have been seismically studied. We present new detections of solar-like oscillations in the clusters M9 and M19, focusing on two key areas: stellar mass loss and GC multiple populations. Using K2 photometry, we detect solar-like oscillations in stars on the red giant branch and early asymptotic giant branch. We measure an integrated mass-loss for M9 of $0.16\pm0.02$(rand)$\pm0.03$(sys)$M_{\odot}$ and M19 of $0.33\pm0.03$(rand)$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$(sys)$M_{\odot}$. Comparing these to the mass-loss estimates from previous seismically studied clusters, we derive a preliminary relationship between stellar mass-loss and metallicity for Type I GCs. We find that the mass-loss for M19 -- a Type II GC -- is significantly larger, suggesting Type II clusters follow a different mass-loss-metallicity trend. We also examine the mass distributions in each evolutionary phase for evidence of a bimodality that could indicate mass differences between sub-populations. While no clear bimodality is observed, there is tentative evidence suggesting the presence of two mass populations. Classification through spectroscopic abundances into the sub-populations is needed to verify these findings. This study reinforces that asteroseismology of GC stars provides an excellent testbed for studying stellar evolution. However, to advance the field we need high-quality photometry of more GCs, a goal that could be realised with the upcoming Roman Telescope.</description>

      <title>Formation Rate of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in Galactic Nuclei Containing Single and Dual Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel class of transients recently discovered in a few extragalactic nuclei. It has been suggested that a QPE can be produced by a main-sequence star undergoing repeated partial disruptions by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) immediately after getting captured on a tightly bound orbit through the Hills mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the period-dependent formation rate of QPEs for this scenario, utilizing scattering experiments and the loss-cone theory. We calculate the QPE formation rates in both a single-SMBH and a dual-SMBHs system, motivated by the over-representation of post-merger galaxies as QPE hosts. We find that for SMBHs of mass $10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$, most QPEs formed in this scenario have periods longer than $\simeq 100$ days. A single-SMBH system generally produces QPEs at a negligible rate of $10^{-10}-10^{-8}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$ due to inefficient two-body relaxation. While in a dual-SMBHs system, the QPE rate is enhanced by $3-4$ orders of magnitude, mainly due to a boosted angular momentum evolution under tidal perturbation from the companion SMBH (galaxy). The QPE rate in a post-merger galactic nucleus hosting two equal-mass SMBHs separated by a few parsecs could reach $10^{-6}-10^{-5}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Our results suggest that a non-negligible fraction ($\simeq 10-90\%$) of long-period QPEs should come from post-merger galaxies.</description>

Helium (He) enrichment, which is correlated with changes in other light elements, might explain this feature. The hot HB stars in the metal-poor globular clusters NGC6397 and NGC6752, instead, show high abundances of heavy elements caused by radiative levitation. Aims: I want to use the abundances of cool blue HB stars in NGC6388 to look for He-enrichment. To exclude effects of radiative levitation for NGC6388 and to investigate the abundance changes caused by radiative levitation, I analysed the blue HB stars in NGC6397 and NGC6752. Methods: I determined effective temperatures and surface gravities from UV-optical photometry and high-resolution spectra together with LTE model spectra. The results were used together with equivalent widths by the GALA program, to provide consistent atmospheric parameters and abundances. Results: For NGC6397 and NGC6752, only moderately hot HB stars were suitable for analysis with GALA. When including literature data, a large scatter is seen at the onset of radiative levitation, followed by increasing abundances up to about 13500 K (Si, Fe), then turning to a plateau (Si) and a forking (Fe) for higher temperatures. NGC6388-4113 shows variations in radial velocity, which may indicate binarity. The metal abundances of the remaining three blue HB stars are consistent with the products of hot hydrogen burning. The data were too noisy to determine He abundances directly. Conclusions: The presence of hot hydrogen burning products in the blue HB stars in NGC6388 could indicate He enrichment. The abundance variations with temperature in moderately hot HB stars in NGC6397 and NGC6752 suggest an influence of parameters beyond rotation and effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a PRS associated with FRB 20240114A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB ($\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\sim$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the respect to the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies, indicates a steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-3 GHz range and the presence of a possible synchrotron peak at $\sim$1 GHz. Optical observations performed with the LBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\sim$1 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with SFR $\sim 1 M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\sim10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Dusty Environment Around RT Vir</title>

Abstract: Infrared studies of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are critical to our understanding of the formation of cosmic dust. In this investigation, we explore the mid-to-far-infrared emission of oxygen rich AGB star RT Virginis. This optically thin dusty environment has unusual spectral features when compared to other stars in its class. To explore this enigmatic object we use the 1-D radiative transfer modeling code DUSTY. Modeled spectra are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), the Herschel Space Observatory and a host of other sources to determine the properties of RT Vir's circumstellar material. Our models suggest a set of two distant and cool dust shells at low optical depths (tauV,inner = 0.16, tauV,outer = 0.06), with inner dust temperatures: T1 = 330K, T3 = 94K. Overall, these dust shells exhibit a chemical composition consistent with dust typically found around O-rich AGB stars. However, the distribution of materials differs significantly. The inner shell consists of a mixture of silicates, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe, while the outer shell primarily contains crystalline Al2O3 polymorphs. This chemical change is indicative of two distinct epochs of dust formation around RT Vir. These changes in dust composition are driven by either changes in the pressure-temperature conditions around the star, or by a decrease in the C/O ratio due to hot-bottom burning.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova progenitors: a contemporary view of a long-standing puzzle</title>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are runaway thermonuclear explosions in white dwarfs that result in the disruption of the white dwarf star, and possibly its nearby stellar companion. SNe Ia occur over an immense range of stellar population age and host galaxy environments, and play a critical role in the nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass and iron-group elements, primarily the production of nickel, iron, cobalt, chromium, and manganese. Though the nature of their progenitors is still not well-understood, SNe Ia are unique among stellar explosions in that the majority of them exhibit a systematic lightcurve relation: more luminous supernovae dim more slowly over time than less luminous supernovae in optical light (intrinsically brighter SNe Ia have broader lightcurves). This feature, unique to SNe Ia, is rather remarkable and allows their peak luminosities to be determined with fairly high accuracy out to cosmological distances via measurement of their lightcurve decline. Further, studying SNe Ia gives us important insights into binary star evolution physics, since it is widely agreed that the progenitors of SNe Ia are binary (possibly multiple) star systems. In this review, we give a current update on the different proposed Type Ia supernova progenitors, including descriptions of possible binary star configurations, and their explosion mechanisms, from a theoretical perspective. We additionally give a brief overview of the historical (focusing on the more recent) observational work that has helped the astronomical community to understand the nature of the most important distance indicators in cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Newly Discovered Nova Super-Remnant Surrounding Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis: Will it Light Up During the Coming Eruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century or less separates the thermonuclear-powered eruptions of recurrent novae in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of massive white dwarfs. The colliding ejecta of successive recurrent nova events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once-in ~80-year recurrent nova event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millenia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [OIII] images, a ~30-parsec-diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Halpha, [NII] and [SII] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically-thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will NOT be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in pre-eruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution. While we cannot predict the morphology or intensity of dust-induced continuum light echoes following the coming flash, we encourage multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging as well as James Webb Space Telescope infrared imaging of T CrB during the year after it erupts.</description>

      <title>On the Age Calibration of Open Clusters using Red Clump Stars</title>

Abstract: In this study, we extend the dust-independent Hatzidimitriou (1991) relation between cluster age and $d_{B-R}$ color difference between the red giant branch (RGB) and red clump to younger cluster ages. We perform membership analysis on fourteen galactic open clusters using Gaia DR3 astrometry, then compute the difference in color of the RGB and red clump $d_{B-R}$ using Gaia photometry. We also compute $d_{B-R}$ for five fields surrounding Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters. We find that the trend derived from older clusters does not extrapolate to younger ages and becomes double-valued. We confirm that $d_{B-R}$ is independent of metallicity. Current stellar evolutionary isochrones do not quantitatively reproduce the trend and furthermore predict an increased color gap with a decrease in metallicity that is not echoed in the data. Integrated light models based on current isochrones exaggerate the color change over the $-0.5 &lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt; 0$ interval at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Exploring Milky Way rotation curves with Gaia DR3: a comparison between $\Lambda$CDM, MOND, and General Relativistic approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate force replay in cosmological-baryonic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct time-evolving gravitational potential models for a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations using basis function expansions. These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (4 angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy's potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors $\leq$4% in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors $\leq$10% for 2-3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors $\sim$10% even after multiple orbital periods. These techniques have diverse applications, including studying satellite disruption in cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Low-mass End of the Mass-Metallicity Relation at $z\sim7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and provides strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use \jwst\ NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at $z=6-8$. Thanks to the strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between $10^{6}$ and $10^{8}$\msol. Using strong lines diagnostics and the most recent \jwst\ calibrations, we derive extremely-low oxygen abundances ranging from 12+log(O/H) = 6.7 to 7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12+{\rm log(O/H)} = $-0.076_{-0.03}^{+0.03} \times ({\rm log}(M_{\star}))^2+ 1.61_{-0.52}^{+0.52}\times {\rm log}(M_{\star})-0.26_{-0.10}^{+0.10}$, which becomes steeper than determinations at $z \sim 3-6$ towards low-mass galaxies. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of highly stochastic star formation and ISM enrichment, expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high-$z$ dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.</description>

      <title>The impact of feedback on the evolution of gas density profiles from galaxies to clusters: a universal fitting formula from the Simba suite of simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\mathrm{200c}} &lt; 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.</description>

      <title>Disparate Effects of Circumgalactic Medium Angular Momentum in IllustrisTNG and SIMBA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of circumgalactic medium (CGM) angular momentum ($j_{\rm CGM}$) on star formation in galaxies, whose influence is currently not well understood. The analysis utilises central galaxies from two hydrodynamical simulations, SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We observe a substantial divergence in how star formation rates correlate with CGM angular momentum between the two simulations. Specifically, quenched galaxies in IllustrisTNG show high $j_{\rm CGM}$, while in SIMBA, quenched galaxies have low $j_{\rm CGM}$. This difference is attributed to the distinct active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback mechanisms active in each simulation. Moreover, both simulations demonstrate similar correlations between $j_{\rm CGM}$ and environmental angular momentum ($j_{\rm Env}$) in star-forming galaxies, but these correlations change notably when kinetic AGN feedback is present. In IllustrisTNG, quenched galaxies consistently show higher $j_{\rm CGM}$ compared to their star-forming counterparts with the same $j_{\rm Env}$, a trend not seen in SIMBA. Examining different AGN feedback models in SIMBA, we further confirm that AGN feedback significantly influences the CGM gas distribution, although the relationship between the cold gas fraction and the star formation rate (SFR) remains largely stable across different feedback scenarios.</description>

      <title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2\lesssim4$ and impact parameter $b/r_{\rm vir,1}\lesssim1$, where $r_{\rm vir,1}$ is the virial radius of the larger subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, $M_s$, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $\sim0.6-0.9$ and cover the area of $\sim5-20\%$ of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales with $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2$, typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the smaller subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and the turbulent flows around them. The distribution of $M_s$ of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at $M_{s,\rm{peak}}\approx2-4.5$ and extending up to $\sim10$. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray-emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{area}}\approx2.3-4.4$ and ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\approx2-4$. In contrast, the cosmic-ray-energy-flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{CR}}\approx3-5$. This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\gtrsim2$ for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with $M_{\rm X-ray}\lesssim2$ are often reported in observations.</description>

      <title>Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters</title>

Abstract: The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at $z\gtrsim10$ compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as $L\propto(2-\frac{5}{4}Y)^{-4}(2-Y)^{-1}$ -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 $\mathring{\rm A}$ UV luminosity by up to $\sim50\%$, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Massive Star Formation: Radio Flux Variability in UCHII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context:
  Theoretical models of early accretion during the formation process of massive stars have predicted that HII regions exhibit radio variability on timescales of decades. However, large-scale searches for such temporal variations with sufficient sensitivity have not yet been carried out.
  Aims:
  We aim to identify HII regions with variable radio wavelength fluxes and to investigate the properties of the identified objects, especially those with the highest level of variability.
  Methods:
  We compared the peak flux densities of 86 ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions measured by the GLOSTAR and CORNISH surveys and identified variables that show flux variations higher than 30% over ~8 yr timespan between these surveys.
  Results:
  We found a sample of 38 variable UCHII regions, which is the largest sample identified to date. The overall occurrence of variability is 44$\pm$5%, suggesting that variation in UCHII regions is significantly more common than prediction.
  The variable UCHII regions are found to be younger than non-variable UCHII regions, all of them meeting the size criterion of hypercompact (HC) HII regions. We studied the 7 UCHII regions (the ``Top7'') that show the highest variability with variations &gt; 100%.
  The Top7 variable UCHII regions are optically thick at 4--8 GHz and compact, suggesting they are in a very early evolutionary stage of HCHII or UCHII regions. There is a significant correlation between variability and the spectral index of the radio emission. No dependence is observed between the variations and the properties of the sources' natal clumps traced by submillimeter continuum emission from dust, although variable HII regions are found in clumps at an earlier evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ II: Hierarchical Structure Analysis of the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the way station at the heart of our Milky Way Galaxy, connecting gas flowing in from Galactic scales with the central nucleus. Key open questions remain about its 3-D structure, star formation properties, and role in regulating this gas inflow. In this work, we identify a hierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density maps from Paper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$), $T_{\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments) properties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). We compare these properties with regions in the Milky Way disk and external galaxies. Despite the fact that the CMZ overall is well below the Gao-Solomon dense gas star-formation relation (and in modest agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), individual structures on the scale of molecular clouds generally follow these star-formation relations and agree well with other Milky Way and extragalactic regions. We find that individual CMZ structures require a large external pressure ($P_e$/k$_B$ $&gt; 10^{7-9}$ K cm$^{-3}$) to be considered bound, however simple estimates suggest that most CMZ molecular-cloud-sized structures are consistent with being in pressure-bounded virial equilibriuim. We perform power-law fits to the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) of the inner 100 pc, SgrB2, and the outer 100 pc of the CMZ as well as several individual molecular cloud structures and find generally steeper power-law slopes ($-9&lt;\alpha&lt;-2$) compared with the literature ($-6 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1$).</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>The perils of stacking optically selected groups in eROSITA data. The Magneticum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.</description>

      <title>The hot gas mass fraction in halos. From Milky Way-like groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using eROSITA data in the eFEDS area, we provide a measure of the hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation over the largest halo mass range, from Milky Way-sized halos to massive clusters, and to the largest radii ever probed so far in local systems. To cope with the incompleteness and selection biases of the X-ray selection, we apply the stacking technique in eROSITA data of a highly complete and tested sample of optically selected groups. The method has been extensively tested on mock observations. In massive clusters, the hot gas alone provides a baryon budget within $R_{200}$ consistent with the cosmic value. At the same time, at the group mass scale, it accounts only for 20-40% of it. The hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation is well-fitted by a power law, with a consistent shape and a normalization varying at maximum by a factor of 2 from $r_{500}$ to $r_{200}$. Such a relation is consistent with other works in the literature that consider X-ray survey data at the same depth as eFEDS. However, it provides a lower average gas fraction in the group regime than works based on X-ray bright group samples. The comparison of the observed relation with the predictions of several hydrodynamical simulations (BAHAMAS, FLAMINGO, SIMBA, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, and Magneticum) shows that all simulations but Magneticum and SIMBA overpredict the gas fraction, with the largest discrepancy (up to a factor of 3) in the massive group-poor cluster halo mass range. We emphasize the need for mechanisms that can effectively expel gas to larger radii in galaxy groups without excessively quenching star formation in their member galaxies. Current hydrodynamical simulations face a significant challenge in balancing their subgrid physics: none can sufficiently evacuate gas from the halo virial region without negatively impacting the properties of the resident galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. From Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>SN H0pe: The First Measurement of $H_0$ from a Multiply-Imaged Type Ia Supernova, Discovered by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 ($z=0.35$) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at $z=1.78$, called ``SN H0pe." Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated post-unblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, $H_0=71.8^{+9.2}_{-8.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The range of admissible $H_0$ values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, but this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnifications, breaking degeneracies and producing our best estimate, $H_0=75.7^{+8.1}_{-5.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This is the first precision measurement of $H_0$ from a multiply-imaged SN Ia and only the second from any multiply-imaged SN.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes Using OH Main Line Masers</title>

Abstract: Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14685</link>

Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>
