      <title>Towards Reproducible Learning-based Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning system typically suffers from a lack of reproducibility that is partially rooted in hardware or software implementation details. The irreproducibility leads to skepticism in deep learning technologies and it can hinder them from being deployed in many applications. In this work, the irreproducibility issue is analyzed where deep learning is employed in compression systems while the encoding and decoding may be run on devices from different manufacturers. The decoding process can even crash due to a single bit difference, e.g., in a learning-based entropy coder. For a given deep learning-based module with limited resources for protection, we first suggest that reproducibility can only be assured when the mismatches are bounded. Then a safeguarding mechanism is proposed to tackle the challenges. The proposed method may be applied for different levels of protection either at the reconstruction level or at a selected decoding level. Furthermore, the overhead introduced for the protection can be scaled down accordingly when the error bound is being suppressed. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for learning-based compression systems, e.g., in image compression and point cloud compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the expanding field of generative artificial intelligence, integrating robust watermarking technologies is essential to protect intellectual property and maintain content authenticity. Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Aware Efficient Projector for MLLMs via Multi-Layer Feature Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The projector plays a crucial role in multi-modal language models (MLLMs). The number of visual tokens it outputs affects the efficiency of the MLLM, while the quality of the visual tokens influences the visual understanding capabilities of the MLLM. Current explorations on the projector focus on reducing the number of visual tokens to improve efficiency, often overlooking the inherent spatial discrepancy between the serialized 2-dimensional visual token sequences and natural language token sequences. A Spatial-Aware Efficient Projector (SAEP) is proposed to address this issue. In detail, our SAEP method employs an modified separable depthwise convolution module on multi-layer visual features to enhance the spatial information of visual tokens. As a result, our SAEP method can not only largely reduce the number of visual tokens by 75\%, but also significantly improve the multimodal spatial understanding capability of MLLMs. Moreover, compared to existing projectors, our SAEP gets best performances on massive multimodal evaluation benchmarks, which denotes its effectiveness on bridging the modality gap.</description>

      <title>Improving Multimodal Learning with Multi-Loss Gradient Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance. However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes. It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance. To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them. We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence. We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods. On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific language models drive research innovation but require extensive fine-tuning on large datasets. This work enhances such models by improving their inference and evaluation capabilities with minimal or no additional training. Focusing on molecule caption generation, we explore synergies between alignment fine-tuning and model merging in a cross-modal setup. We reveal intriguing insights into the behaviour and suitability of such methods while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel atomic-level evaluation method leveraging off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for use in the unseen chemical domain. Our experiments demonstrate that our evaluation operates at the right level of granularity, effectively handling multiple content units and subsentence reasoning, while widely adopted NLI methods consistently misalign with assessment criteria.</description>

      <title>VidMuse: A Simple Video-to-Music Generation Framework with Long-Short-Term Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 360K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment. The code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/ZeyueT/VidMuse/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19340v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive mental health condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based tri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of depression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture incorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses a two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first work to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for this task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge cross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split, surpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In Leave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score of 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.</description>

      <title>Detecting Audio-Visual Deepfakes with Fine-Grained Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</description>

      <title>SceneDreamer360: Text-Driven 3D-Consistent Scene Generation with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation has seen significant advancements recently. However, most existing methods generate single-view images using generative models and then stitch them together in 3D space. This independent generation for each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the fine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement, enabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images. During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/SceneDreamer360}.</description>

      <title>Multi-Track MusicLDM: Towards Versatile Music Generation with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in cross-modal generation tasks involving audio and music, such as text-to-sound and text-to-music generation. These text-controlled music generation models typically focus on generating music by capturing global musical attributes like genre and mood. However, music composition is a complex, multilayered task that often involves musical arrangement as an integral part of the process. This process involves composing each instrument to align with existing ones in terms of beat, dynamics, harmony, and melody, requiring greater precision and control over tracks than text prompts usually provide. In this work, we address these challenges by extending the MusicLDM, a latent diffusion model for music, into a multi-track generative model. By learning the joint probability of tracks sharing a context, our model is capable of generating music across several tracks that correspond well to each other, either conditionally or unconditionally. Additionally, our model is capable of arrangement generation, where the model can generate any subset of tracks given the others (e.g., generating a piano track complementing given bass and drum tracks). We compared our model with an existing multi-track generative model and demonstrated that our model achieves considerable improvements across objective metrics for both total and arrangement generation tasks.</description>

      <title>STanH : Parametric Quantization for Variable Rate Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In end-to-end learned image compression, encoder and decoder are jointly trained to minimize a $R + {\lambda}D$ cost function, where ${\lambda}$ controls the trade-off between rate of the quantized latent representation and image quality. Unfortunately, a distinct encoder-decoder pair with millions of parameters must be trained for each ${\lambda}$, hence the need to switch encoders and to store multiple encoders and decoders on the user device for every target rate. This paper proposes to exploit a differentiable quantizer designed around a parametric sum of hyperbolic tangents, called STanH , that relaxes the step-wise quantization function. STanH is implemented as a differentiable activation layer with learnable quantization parameters that can be plugged into a pre-trained fixed rate model and refined to achieve different target bitrates. Experimental results show that our method enables variable rate coding with comparable efficiency to the state-of-the-art, yet with significant savings in terms of ease of deployment, training time, and storage costs</description>
