      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrino searches using next-generation gravitational wave detectors at radio neutrino detectors: GRAND, IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be sources of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and potential emitters of UHE neutrinos. The upcoming and current radio neutrino detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) are projected to reach the required sensitivities to search for these neutrinos. In particular, in conjunction with the next-generation of gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), GW-triggered stacking searches can be performed with the UHE neutrino detectors. In this work, we explore the prospects of such searches by implementing in our analysis an upper distance limit based on the sky-localization capabilities of the GW detectors from which meaningful triggers can be collected. We find that if each GW burst is associated with a total isotropic-equivalent energy of $\sim 10^{50} - 10^{51}$ erg emitted in UHE neutrinos, along with a corresponding beaming fraction of $1$\%, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 Radio have a large probability ($\sim 99$\%) to detect a coincident neutrino event using the joint combination of CE+ET in a timescale of less than 15 years of operation for our fiducial choice of parameters. In case of nondetections, the parameter spaces can be constrained at $3\sigma$ level in similar timescales of operation. We also highlight and discuss the prospects of such joint radio neutrino detector network, their importance, and their role in facilitating synergic GW and neutrino observations in the next era of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various non-axisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter SNR of 20 and a rate similar to supernovae Ib/c, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: The secondary maximum in Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves have a secondary maximum that exists in the $r$, $i$, and near-infrared filters. The secondary maximum is relatively weak in the $r$ band, but holds the advantage that it is accessible, even at high redshift. We used Gaussian Process fitting to parameterise the light curves of 893 SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility's (ZTF) second data release (DR2), and we were able to extract information about the timing and strength of the secondary maximum. We found $&gt;5\sigma$ correlations between the light curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(g)$) and the timing and strength of the secondary maximum in the $r$ band. Whilst the timing of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band also correlates with $\Delta m_{15}(g)$, the strength of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band shows significant scatter as a function of $\Delta m_{15}(g)$. We found that the transparency timescales of 97 per cent of our sample are consistent with double detonation models, and that SNe Ia with small transparency timescales ($&lt;$ 32 d) reside predominantly in locally red environments. We measured the total ejected mass for the normal SNe Ia in our sample using two methods, and both were consistent with medians of $1.3\ \pm \ 0.3$ and $1.2\ \pm\ 0.2$ solar masses. We find that the strength of the secondary maximum is a better standardisation parameter than the SALT light curve stretch ($x_1$). Finally, we identified a spectral feature in the $r$ band as Fe II, which strengthens during the onset of the secondary maximum. The same feature begins to strengthen at $&lt;$ 3 d post maximum light in 91bg-like SNe. Finally, the correlation between $x_1$ and the strength of the secondary maximum was best fit with a broken line, with a split at $x_1^0\ =\ -0.5\ \pm\ 0.2$, suggestive of the existence of two populations of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>A lensed FRB candidate in the first CHIME/FRB Catalogue and its potential implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are immensely energetic radio pulses with durations of milliseconds. Given their high all-sky rate, the probability of an FRB being lensed by an intervening massive object is non-negligible. In this study, we search for possible lensing candidates within the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB catalogue using an autocorrelation algorithm and verification through signal simulations. We identify FRB 20190308C as a lensed candidate with a significance of 3.4 sigma. Furthermore, we constrain the mass of the lensing object using the Chang-Refsdal lens model, based on the flux ratio and time delay between the substructures of FRB 20190308C. Future long-term and high-precision observations are expected to reveal more lensed FRBs.</description>

      <title>Jet interaction with galaxy cluster mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGN bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to significantly facilitate the transport of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations are revealing complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bi-directional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic and CRe energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CRe component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail (WAT) and X-shaped sources in the course of the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of $\sim1$--2 Mpc within $\sim5$--6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and explore the possibility for the CRe jet material to be re-accelerated by super-Alfv\`enic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find that the emission can be volume-filing, $\gtrsim 70$\%. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock re-acceleration.</description>

      <title>Forecast of cosmological constraints with superluminous supernovae from the Chinese Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a class of intense celestial events that can be standardized for measuring cosmological parameters, bridging the gap between type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we discuss the cosmological applications of SLSNe from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our estimation suggests that SLSNe rate is biased tracing the cosmic star formation rate, exhibiting a factor of $(1+z)^{1.2}$. We futher predict that CSST is poised to observe $\sim 360$ SLSNe in the 10 square degrees ultra-deep field survey within a span of 2.5 years. A stringent constraint on cosmological parameters can be derived from their peak-color relationship. CSST is anticipated to uncover a substantial number of SLSNe, contributing to a deeper understanding of their central engines and shedding light on the nature of dark energy at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Ringdown amplitudes of nonspinning eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the ringdown complex amplitudes of nonspinning unequal-mass binaries in arbitrarily eccentric orbits are presented. They are built upon 237 numerical simulations contained within the RIT catalog, through the parameterisation introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 101401]. Global fits for the complex amplitudes, associated to linear quasinormal mode frequencies of the dominant ringdown modes, are obtained in a factorised form immediately applicable to any existing quasi-circular model. Similarly to merger amplitudes, ringdown ones increase by more than 50% compared to the circular case for high impact parameters (medium eccentricities), while strongly suppressed in the low impact parameter (highly eccentric) limit. Such reduction can be explained by a transition between an "orbital-type" and an "infall-type" dynamics. The amplitudes (phases) fits accuracy lies around a few percent (deciradians) for the majority of the dataset, comparable to the accuracy of current state-of-the-art quasi-circular ringdown models, and well within current statistical errors of current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ringdown observations. These expressions constitute another building block towards the construction of complete general-relativistic inspiral-merger-ringdown semi-analytical templates, and allow to extend numerically-informed spectroscopic analyses beyond the circular limit. Such generalisations are key to achieve accurate inference of compact binaries astrophysical properties, and tame astrophysical systematics within observational investigations of strong-field general relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Constraints on Dark Photon Tridents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons that are sufficiently light and/or weakly-interacting represent a compelling vision of dark matter. Dark photon decay into three photons, which we call the dark photon trident, can be the dominant channel when the dark photon mass falls below the electron pair threshold and can produce a significant flux of x-rays. We use 16 years of data from INTEGRAL/SPI to constrain sub-MeV dark photon decay, producing new worlds-best constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses between 61 keV and 1022 keV, and comment on the potential for future x-ray observatories to discover the trident decay process.</description>

      <title>Unobscured radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei under the eyes of IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the X-ray polarimetric analyses performed on unobscured radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), with simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data. The synergy of these instruments is crucial to constrain the X-ray corona physical properties and assess its geometry. In the first two years of operation, three AGN have been observed: significant polarization was detected for NGC 4151 (4.9$\pm$1.1 per cent) and IC 4329A (albeit with less confidence, 3.3$\pm$1.1 per cent), with polarization angles aligned with their radio jets, while only an upper limit was found for MCG-05-23-16 ($&lt;$3.2 per cent). Monte Carlo simulations, conducted to investigate the coronal geometry of these AGN, favor a radially extended corona geometry in NGC 4151 and IC 4329A, a scenario consistent also with MCG-05-23-16, if the disk inclination angle is below 50$^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo DESI: large-scale bars as a secular mechanism for triggering AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the evidence that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) co-evolve with their host galaxy, and that most of the growth of these SMBHs occurs via merger-free processes, the underlying mechanisms which drive this secular co-evolution are poorly understood. We investigate the role that both strong and weak large-scale galactic bars play in mediating this relationship. Using 72,940 disc galaxies in a volume-limited sample from Galaxy Zoo DESI, we analyse the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction in strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred galaxies up to z = 0.1 over a range of stellar masses and colours. After controlling for stellar mass and colour, we find that the optically selected AGN fraction is 31.6 +/- 0.9 per cent in strongly barred galaxies, 23.3 +/- 0.8 per cent in weakly barred galaxies, and 14.2 +/- 0.6 per cent in unbarred disc galaxies. These are highly statistically robust results, strengthening the tantalising results in earlier works. Strongly barred galaxies have a higher fraction of AGNs than weakly barred galaxies, which in turn have a higher fraction than unbarred galaxies. Thus, while bars are not required in order to grow a SMBH in a disc galaxy, large-scale galactic bars appear to facilitate AGN fuelling, and the presence of a strong bar makes a disc galaxy more than twice as likely to host an AGN than an unbarred galaxy at all galaxy stellar masses and colours.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Ejecta Velocities of Type Ia Supernovae from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from multiple explosion channels. Previous studies have indicated that the ejecta velocity of SNe Ia is one powerful tool to discriminate between different channels. In this work, we study ~400 confirmed SNe Ia discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), and obtain a sample of ~50 SNe Ia that have near-peak Si II 6355 velocity (Vsi) measurements. We investigate the relationships between Vsi and various parameters, including SN light-curve width, color, host-galaxy properties, and redshift. No significant trends are identified between Vsi and light-curve parameters. Regarding the host-galaxy properties, we see a significant trend that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia (Vsi &gt; 12000 km/s) tend to reside in more massive galaxies compared to normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia (Vsi &lt; 12000 km/s) when combining both the PS1-MDS dataset and those from previous low-z studies. While we do not see a significant trend between Vsi and redshift, HV SNe Ia appear to be more prevalent in low-z samples than in high-z samples. We discuss several possibilities that could potentially contribute to this trend. Furthermore, we investigate the potential bias on SN Ia distances and find no significant difference in Hubble residuals between HV and NV subgroups.</description>

      <title>Systematically Revisiting All NuSTAR Spins of Black Holes in X-Ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our recent work on black hole spin in X-ray binary systems to include an analysis of 189 archival NuSTAR observations from 24 sources. Using self-consistent data reduction pipelines, spectral models, and statistical techniques, we report an unprecedented and uniform sample of 36 stellar-mass black hole spin measurements based on relativistic reflection. This treatment suggests that prior reports of low spins in a small number of sources were generally erroneous: our comprehensive treatment finds that those sources tend to harbor black holes with high spin values. Overall, within $1\sigma$ uncertainty, $\sim86\%$ of the sample are consistent with $a \geq 0.95$, $\sim94\%$ of the sample are consistent with $a\geq 0.9$, and $100\%$ is consistent with $a\geq 0.7$ (the theoretical maximum for neutron stars; $a = cJ/GM^{2}$). We also find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (those with A-, B-, or O-type companions) are consistent with $a\geq 0.9$ within the $1\sigma$ errors; this is in agreement with the low-mass X-ray binary population and may be especially important for comparisons to black holes discovered in gravitational wave events. In some cases, different spectra from the same source yield similar spin measurements but conflicting values for the inclination of the inner disk; we suggest that this is due to variable disk winds obscuring the blue wing of the relativistic Fe K emission line. We discuss the implications of our measurements, the unique view of systematic uncertainties enabled by our treatment, and future efforts to characterize black hole spins with new missions.</description>

      <title>The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07177</link>

Abstract: The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the long term evolution of the observed intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069.In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069.We found the effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed long term evolution in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint reconstruction of imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array and extensive air shower array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed a joint reconstruction of \gray events using both extensive air array (EAS) and Imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array (IACT). We considered eight Cherenkov telescopes to be built on the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) site and investigate the improvement in differential sensitivity when combining the information from both IACT and Moun detectors of LHAASO-KM2A. We found that due to the higher cosmic ray background rejection power and higher gamma ray retention ratio provided by muon detectors of LHAASO, such a joint reconstruction can significantly improve the sensitivity of IACTs, especially for extended sources and long exposure time. In this article, we have shown the performance of an eight-telescopes mini array, and our results indicate that above $10~\rm TeV$, the sensitivity can be improved by muon detector from $25\% - 60\%$ in different energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric study to constrain accretion-ejection properties of MCG-5-23-16 using IXPE and NuSTAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the X-ray polarization properties of MGC-5-23-16 by analyzing long-term monitoring data from NuSTAR jointly with IXPE observations made in May and November 2022. The re-analysis of IXPE data gives model-dependent polarization degree, PD (\%)=$1.08\pm0.66$ in the energy band $2-8$ keV, which agrees with previous studies within error bars. The model-independent analysis of PD poses an upper limit of $\leq3.8$ ($1\sigma$ level) for the same energy band. The observed upper limit of PD, along with broadband spectral analysis ($2-79$ keV) using an accretion-ejection based model, allowed us to derive the corona geometry (i.e. radius and height) and the accretion disk inclination ($\sim 33^\circ$). Additional {\it NuSTAR} observations were also analyzed to gain insights into the accretion flow properties of the source and to estimate the expected polarization during those epochs with PD $\sim 4.3\%$. The radius and height of the corona varies between $28.2\pm3.1 - 39.8\pm4.6$ r$_s$ and $14.3\pm1.7-21.4\pm1.9$ r$_s$ respectively, with a mass outflow rate from the corona measuring $0.14\pm0.03-0.2\pm0.03$ Eddington rate ($\dot m_{\rm Edd}$). The spectral analysis further provided an estimate for the mass of the central black hole $\sim 2\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ and the velocity of the outflowing gas $\sim 0.16-0.19c$. A comparative broadband spectral study using reflection-based models estimates the disk inclination between $\sim 31^\circ\pm8^\circ-45^\circ\pm7^\circ$, and yields an expected PD of 3.4-6.0\%. We also found a weak reflection fraction and a less ionized distant reflecting medium. Our modeling of the disk-corona-outflows and polarization connection can be extended and validated with data from the recently launched XPoSat, India's first X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, offering potential applications to other sources.</description>

      <title>Long gamma-ray burst light curves as the result of a common stochastic pulse-avalanche process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.</description>

      <title>Coherent Inverse Compton Scattering in Fast Radio Bursts Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing observations of temporal, spectral, and polarization properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the radio emission of the majority of bursts is likely produced inside the magnetosphere of its central engine, likely a magnetar. We revisit the idea that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches at a distance of a few hundred times of the magnetar radius. Following findings are revealed: 1. Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfv\'en waves. Fast magnetosonic waves with the same frequency can be generated directly or be converted from Alfv\'en waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs via the ICS process. 2. The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant ICS can occur at $r \gtrsim 100 R_\star$ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation power but still in the linear scattering regime. 3. The low-frequency fast magnetosonic waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. 4. The required bunch net charge density can be sub-Goldreich-Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. 5. This model can account for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0026$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>

      <title>GRB 211211A: The Case for Engine Powered over r-Process Powered Blue Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) GRB 211211A provides the earliest ($\sim 5$ h) data of a kilonova (KN) event, displaying bright ($\sim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and blue early emission. Previously, this KN has been explained using simplistic multi-component fitting methods. Here, in order to understand the physical origin of the KN emission in GRB 211211A, we employ an analytic multi-zone model for r-process powered KN. We find that r-process powered KN models alone cannot explain the fast temporal evolution and the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the observed emission. Specifically, i) r-process models require high ejecta mass to match early luminosity, which overpredicts late-time emission, while ii) red KN models that reproduce late emission underpredict early luminosity. We propose an alternative scenario involving early contributions from the GRB central engine via a late low-power jet, consistent with plateau emission in short GRBs and GeV emission detected by Fermi-LAT at $\sim10^4$ s after GRB 211211A. Such late central engine activity, with an energy budget of $\sim \text{a few }\%$ of that of the prompt jet, combined with a single red-KN ejecta component, can naturally explain the light curve and SED of the observed emission; with the late-jet -- ejecta interaction reproducing the early blue emission and r-process heating reproducing the late red emission. This supports claims that late low-power engine activity after prompt emission may be common. We encourage very early follow-up observations of future nearby GRBs, and compact binary merger events, to reveal more about the central engine of GRBs and r-process events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a conceptual and technical survey of methods for parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals in ground-based interferometers such as LIGO and Virgo. We introduce the framework of Bayesian inference and provide an overview of models for the generation and detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers, focusing on the essential features that are observable in the signals. Within the traditional likelihood-based paradigm, we describe various approaches for enhancing the efficiency and robustness of parameter inference. This includes techniques for accelerating likelihood evaluations, such as heterodyne/relative binning, reduced-order quadrature, multibanding and interpolation. We also cover methods to simplify the analysis to improve convergence, via reparametrization, importance sampling and marginalization. We end with a discussion of recent developments in the application of likelihood-free (simulation-based) inference methods to gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Rastall gravity: hydrostatic equilibrium and radial pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of Rastall gravity, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability against radial pulsations of compact stars, where a free parameter $\beta$ measures the deviations from General Relativity (GR). We derive both the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and the Sturm-Liouville differential equation governing the adiabatic radial oscillations. Such equations are solved numerically in order to obtain the compact-star properties for two realistic equations of state (EoSs). For hadronic matter, the fundamental mode frequency $\omega_0$ becomes unstable almost at the critical central energy density corresponding to the maximum gravitational mass. However, for quark matter, where larger values of $\vert\beta\vert$ are required to observe appreciable changes in the mass-radius diagram, there exist stable stars after the maximum-mass configuration for negative values of $\beta$. Using an independent analysis, our results reveal that the emergence of a cusp can be used as a criterion to indicate the onset of instability when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to $\omega_0^2 =0$.</description>
