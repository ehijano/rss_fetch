      <title>Concentrated real-pole uniform-in-time approximation of the matrix exponential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an asympotically optimal choice of shared concentrated real poles of a family of rational approximants of time-dependent exponential functions $\exp(-tz)$ for $z \geq 0$ and $t$ in a positive time interval $T$. Our result extends a classical result by J.-E.Andersson [J.Approx.Theory, 32(2):85--95, 1981] on the asymptotic best rational approximation of $\exp(-z)$ with real poles. Numerical experiments demonstrate the near-optimality of our choice for various time ranges and for both small and large approximation degrees. An application of the uniform-in-time rational approximation using our proposed concentrated real poles to a linear constant-coefficient initial-value problem is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pressure-robust optimally convergent H(div) finite element method without the commuting diagram property for the steady Oseen equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a convergence theory for H(div)-conforming finite element methods applied to the steady Oseen problem, focusing on cases where the exact finite element complex holds while the commuting diagram property may fail. The proposed method incorporates vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order convergence of the velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes.</description>

      <title>BDF2-type integrator for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in micromagnetics, part I: unconditional weak convergence to weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) that models time-dependent micromagnetic phenomena. We propose a full discretization that employs first-order finite elements in space and a BDF2-type two-step method in time. In each time step, only one linear system of equations has to be solved. We employ linear interpolation in time to reconstruct the discrete space-time magnetization. We prove that the integrator is unconditionally stable and thus guarantees that a subsequence of the reconstructed magnetization converges weakly in $H^1$ towards a weak solution of LLG in the space-time domain. Numerical experiments verify that the proposed integrator is indeed first-order in space and second-order in time.</description>

      <title>Broken-FEEC on multipatch domains with local refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach for broken-FEEC (Finite Element Exterior Calculus), extending its application to locally refined spline spaces with non-matching interfaces. Traditional broken-FEEC allows for discontinuous discretizations at patch interfaces, preserving the de Rham structure and offering computational benefits. However, local refinements often lead to numerical artifacts. Our solution involves developing moment-preserving discrete conforming projection operators. These operators are explicit, localized, and metric-independent, ensuring $H^1$ and $H(\text{curl})$ continuity across non-matching interfaces while preserving high-order polynomial moments. This results in broken-FEEC de Rham sequences with accurate strong and weak derivatives, leading to energy-preserving Maxwell solvers that are explicit and virtually free of spurious modes. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy of our method in eliminating spurious waves.</description>

      <title>The Reduced Basis Multigrid scheme for the Virtual Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-nested W-cycle multigrid scheme for the lowest order Virtual Element Method on polygonal meshes. To avoid the implicit definition of the Virtual Element space, which poses several issues in the computation of intergrid operators that underpin multigrid methods, the proposed scheme uses a fully-conforming auxiliary space constructed by cheaply computing the virtual basis functions via the reduced basis method.</description>

      <title>High-Order Asymptotic-Preserving IMEX schemes for an ES-BGK model for Gas Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we construct a high-order Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme for the ES-BGK model for gas mixtures introduced in [Brull, Commun. Math. Sci., 2015]. The time discretization is based on the IMEX strategy proposed in [Filbet, Jin, J. Sci. Comput., 2011] for the single-species BGK model and is here extended to the multi-species ES-BGK setting. The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation. The proposed approach can handle an arbitrary number of species. Its accuracy and robustness are demonstrated on a set of multidimensional kinetic tests for gas mixtures, where the AP property and the correct asymptotics are numerically verified across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Weyl distributions, spectral properties, and circulant approximation results for quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work contains a comprehensive treatment of Weyl eigenvalue and singular value distributions for single-axis quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences generated by $s\times t$ quaternion matrix-valued, $d$-variate, Lebesgue integrable generating functions. Furthermore, in view of concrete applications, we are interested in preconditioning and matrix approximation results. To this end, a crucial step is the extension of the notion of an approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) to the case of matrix sequences with quaternion entries, since it allows us to decompose the difference between a matrix and its preconditioner into low-norm plus (relatively) low-rank terms. As a specific example, we consider classes of quaternion block multilevel circulant matrix sequences as an a.c.s. for quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences. These approximation results lay the foundations for fast preconditioning methods when dealing with large quaternion linear systems stemming from modern applications. We conclude our study with numerical experiments and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Parabolic hysteresis problems revisited: Finite element error analysis and convergent Newton-type solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical investigations of partial differential equations with hysteresis have largely focused on simulations, leaving numerical error analysis unexplored and relying mainly on derivative-free nonlinear solvers. This work establishes rigorous finite element error estimates for the backward Euler fully discrete scheme applied to semilinear and quasilinear parabolic equations involving continuous hysteresis operators. To efficiently handle the inherent nonsmoothness of the resulting nonlinear algebraic systems, we develop a damped smoothing Newton solver under a general condition on the smoothing approximation, ensuring global convergence together with local Q-quadratic convergence. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates for semilinear problems, while showing higher-than-predicted orders for quasilinear ones. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed solver are further demonstrated in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Low-rank cross approximation of function-valued tensors for reduced-order modeling of parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers function-valued tensors, viewed as multidimensional arrays with entries in an abstract Hilbert space. Despite the absence of the algebraic structure of a field, the geometric inner-product structure suffices to introduce the Tucker rank, higher-order SVD, and Tucker-cross decomposition for function-valued tensors. An adaptive cross-approximation algorithm is developed to compute low-rank approximations of such tensors. The framework is motivated by, and applied to, model order reduction of the parameter-to-solution map for a parametric PDE. The resulting reduced-order model can be interpreted as an encoder-decoder scheme with a nonlinear encoder and a multilinear decoder. The performance of the proposed non-intrusive approximation method is demonstrated in numerical examples for two nonlinear parametric PDE systems.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Localized Orthogonal Decomposition Method for Heterogeneous Stokes Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-order extension of the multiscale method introduced by the authors in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 63(4) (2025), pp. 1617--1641] for heterogeneous Stokes problems, while also providing several other improvements, including a better localization strategy and a more precise pressure reconstruction. The proposed method is based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition methodology and achieves optimal convergence orders under minimal structural assumptions on the coefficients. A key feature of our approach is the careful design of so-called quantities of interest, defining functionals of the solution whose values the multiscale approximation aims to reproduce exactly. Their selection is particularly delicate in the context of Stokes problems due to potential conflicts arising from the divergence-free constraint. We prove the exponential decay of the problem-adapted basis functions, justifying their localized computation in practical implementations. A rigorous a priori error analysis proves high-order convergence for both velocity and pressure, if the basis supports grow logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A fifth-order absolutely convergent fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid alternative WENO scheme for steady state of hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the previous work on absolutely convergent fixed-point fast sweeping WENO methods by Li et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 443: 110516, 2021) and design a fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping scheme for solving steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Unlike many other fast sweeping methods, the explicit property of fixed-point fast sweeping methods provides flexibility to apply the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AWENO) scheme with unequal-sized substencils as the local solver, which facilitates the usage of arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes. Furthermore, a novel hybrid technique is designed in the local solver to combine the nonlinear AWENO interpolation with the linear scheme for an additional improvement in efficiency of the high-order fast sweeping iterations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils can achieve absolute convergence (i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine zero / round off errors) more easily than the original AWENO method with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than the popular third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time-marching approach to converge to steady state solutions.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving semi-implicit four-split scheme for continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel structure-preserving vertex-staggered semi-implicit four-split discretization of a unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics that is able to describe at the same time fluid and solid materials within the same mathematical model. The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties.</description>

      <title>Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</description>

      <title>A Path-Conservative Method for a Weakly Compressible Two-Phase Model with Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When extended to two-phase flows, weakly compressible models lead to a non-conservative system, which precludes its treatment using standard finite volume techniques. In this paper, a novel HLLC-type path-conservative scheme is formulated for the weakly compressible two-phase model. Furthermore, capillary effects are included in the proposed path-conservative scheme, eliminating the need to discretize surface tension terms separately. The first-order path-conservative formulation is combined with a local solution reconstruction technique to obtain high-order spatial accuracy. The solver is tested on several benchmark two-phase flow problems to demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Moment Approximations to Magnetic Rotating Shallow Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally introduced to describe a transition region in stars, the magnetic rotating shallow water (MRSW) model is now used in many solar physics and geophysical applications. Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection. Through numerical experiments for MRSW moment systems up to third-order, we demonstrate that these moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Conservative and dissipative discretisations of multi-conservative ODEs and GENERIC systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) describing thermodynamically isolated systems typically possess conserved quantities (like mass, momentum, and energy) and dissipated quantities (like entropy). Preserving these conservation and dissipation laws on discretisation in time can yield vastly better approximations for the same computational effort, compared to schemes that are not structure-preserving. In this work we present two novel contributions: (i) an arbitrary-order time discretisation for general conservative ordinary differential equations that conserves all known invariants and (ii) an energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for both ordinary and partial differential equations written in the GENERIC format, a superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems. In both cases the underlying strategy is the same: the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables, allowing for the replication at the discrete level of the proofs of conservation or dissipation. We illustrate the advantages of our approximations with numerical examples of the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, a combustion engine model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Phase Dual-PINN Framework: Soft Boundary-Interior Specialization via Distance-Weighted Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often struggle with multi-scale PDEs featuring sharp gradients and nontrivial boundary conditions, as the physics residual and boundary enforcement compete during optimization. We present a dual-network framework that decomposes the solution as $u = u_{\text{D}} + u_{\text{B}}$, where $u_{\text{D}}$ (domain network) captures interior dynamics and $u_{\text{B}}$ (boundary network) handles near-boundary corrections. Both networks share a unified physics residual while being softly specialized via distance-weighted priors ($w_{\text{bd}} = \exp(-d/\tau)$) that are cosine-annealed during training. Boundary conditions are enforced through an augmented Lagrangian method, eliminating manual penalty tuning. Training proceeds in two phases: Phase~1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles and stabilize boundary satisfaction; Phase~2 employs focused sampling (e.g. ring sampling near $\partial\Omega$) with annealed role weights to efficiently resolve localized features. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the 1D Fokker-Planck equation, the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, and the 1D wave equation. Across Laplace and Poisson benchmarks, our method reduces error by $36-90\%$, improves boundary satisfaction by $21-88\%$, and decreases MAE by $2.2-9.3\times$ relative to a single-network PINN. Ablations isolate contributions of (i)~soft boundary-interior specialization, (ii)~annealed role regularization, and (iii)~the two-phase curriculum. The method is simple to implement, adds minimal computational overhead, and broadly applies to PDEs with sharp solutions and complex boundary data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachable Minimally supported (RM) B-splines have been recently introduced as a novel B-spline--like basis. They feature local linear independence and admit a fast de Boor--like evaluation algorithm. These properties make them particularly attractive for applications in isogeometric analysis. In this note, we show that automatic mesh refinement procedures can be readily established by observing that RM B-splines are a special case of Locally Refined (LR) B-splines.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Phase-Averaged and Phase-Resolving Wave Models for Coastal Modeling Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting ocean wave behavior is challenging due to the difficulty in choosing suitable numerical models among many with varying capabilities. This review examines the development and performance of numerical wave models in coastal engineering and oceanography, focusing on the difference between phase-averaged spectral models and phase-resolving models. We evaluate the formulation, governing equations, and methods of widely used third-generation phase-averaged spectral models (SWAN, WAVEWATCH III, MIKE 21 SW, TOMAWAC, and WAM) alongside advanced phase-resolving models (FUNWAVE, SWASH, COULWAVE, and NHWAVE) that employ Boussinesq-type equations and non-hydrostatic formulations. The review begins with early parameterized models and progresses to contemporary third-generation models, which solve the wave action conservation equation with few spectral constraints. A comparison of the models' efficiency, accuracy in nearshore conditions, ability to resolve nonlinear wave-wave interaction, simulate wave breaking, diffraction, and wave-current interactions is provided. Applications in operational forecasting, extreme event simulation, coastal structure design, and assessing climate change impacts are discussed. The validation of these models and the statistical metrics and intercomparison studies used are addressed. A discussion of the limitations in computational scalability, physics parameterization, and model coupling is provided, along with emerging trends in high-resolution modeling and hybrid models. This review guides researchers in evaluating which models to use in coastal and oceanographic research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudo-spectral Algorithms for Statistical Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present stochastic variants of the exponential time differencing schemes for stiff stochastic differential equations. We derive three explicit schemes that offer better stability compared to Euler-Maruyama and Milstein's method, and achieve strong convergence up to order O(h) in the time step h. We combine these schemes with a pseudo-spectral approach to outline efficient algorithms for simulating stochastic field theories with additive noise. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on Rd with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. In an earlier joint work, we proved that the algorithm samples from Gibbs measures supported on torus with time complexity that is polynomial in the inverse temperature; however, the approach breaks down in the non-compact setting. This work overcomes this obstacle and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the seventh power of the inverse temperature, the square of the inverse allowed absolute error and the square of the inverse allowed probability error.</description>

      <title>High fidelity simulations of the multi-species Vlasov-Maxwell system with the Numerical Flow Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validity of fluid models breaks down for non-thermal or weakly collisional plasmas which often occur e.g. in the solar wind. In these regimes one has to resort to modelling through the first-principle Vlasov-Maxwell system, but its six-dimensional phase-space dynamics, strong filamentation, and multi-scale structure make direct numerical simulation extremely demanding. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method based on an iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics. The approach reconstructs the phase-space dynamics from the time history of the electromagnetic fields and the initial distribution functions, enabling extremely high effective resolution far below the phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data. Earlier work demonstrated this capability for the multi-species electrostatic Vlasov system. Here we discuss an extension of the method to the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations using a Hamiltonian splitting to advance the solution in a structure-preserving way while retaining the reduced memory footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies function approximation in Gaussian Sobolev spaces over the real line and measures the error in a Gaussian-weighted $L^p$-norm. We construct two linear approximation algorithms using $n$ function evaluations that achieve the optimal or almost optimal rate of worst-case convergence in a Gaussian Sobolev space of order $\alpha$. The first algorithm is based on scaled trigonometric interpolation and achieves the optimal rate $n^{-\alpha}$ up to a logarithmic factor. This algorithm can be constructed in almost-linear time with the fast Fourier transform. The second algorithm is more complicated, being based on spline smoothing, but attains the optimal rate $n^{-\alpha}$.</description>

The considered problem do not need to assume that $\nabla V$ or $\nabla W$ are globally Lipschitz. With the aim of providing particle approximation of solutions, we design efficient forward-backward splitting algorithms.

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of an Enhanced Finite Element Method for Mani\`a's and Foss's Problems Exhibiting the Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that numerically approximating calculus of variations problems possessing a Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon (LGP) is challenging, and the standard numerical methodologies, such as finite element, finite difference, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, fail to give convergent methods because they cannot overcome the gap. This paper is a continuation of a 2016 paper by Feng and Schnake, where a promising enhanced finite element method was proposed to overcome the LGP in the classical Mani\`a's problem. The first goal of this paper is to provide a complete $\Gamma$-convergence proof for this enhanced finite element method, hence, establishing a theoretical foundation for the method. The crux of the convergence analysis is taking advantage of the regularity of the minimizer and viewing the minimization problem as posed over the fractional Sobolev space $W^{1 + s, p}(0, 1)$ (for $s &gt; 0$) rather than the original admissible space $W^{1, p}(0, 1)$. The second goal is to extend the enhanced finite element method to the two-dimensional Foss's problem from nonlinear elasticity, which is also known to possess the LGP, and to establish its $\Gamma$-convergence as well.</description>

      <title>Effective algorithms for tensor train decomposition via the UTV framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor-train (TT) decomposition is widely used to compress large tensors into a more compact form by exploiting their inherent data structures. A fundamental approach for constructing the TT format is the well-known TT-SVD method, which performs singular value decompositions (SVDs) on the successive matrices sequentially. But in practical applications, it is often unnecessary to compute full SVDs. In this article, we propose a new method called the TT-UTV. It utilizes the virtues of rank-revealing UTV decomposition to compute the TT format for a large-scale tensor, resulting in lower computational cost. We analyze the error bounds on the accuracy of these algorithms in both the URV and ULV cases and then recommend different sweep patterns for these two cases. Based on the theoretical analysis, we also formulate the rank-adaptive algorithms with prescribed accuracy. Numerical experiments on various applications, including magnetic resonance imaging data completion, are performed to illustrate their good performance in practice.</description>

      <title>Randomized block-Krylov subspace methods for low-rank approximation of matrix functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized SVD is a method to compute an inexpensive, yet accurate, low-rank approximation of a matrix. The algorithm assumes access to the matrix through matrix-vector products (matvecs). Therefore, when we would like to apply the randomized SVD to a matrix function, $f(A)$, one needs to approximate matvecs with $f(A)$ using some other algorithm, which is typically treated as a black-box. Chen and Hallman (SIMAX 2023) argued that, in the common setting where matvecs with $f(A)$ are approximated using Krylov subspace methods (KSMs), a more efficient low-rank approximation is possible if we open this black-box. They present an alternative approach that significantly outperforms the naive combination of KSMs with the randomized SVD, although the method lacked theoretical justification. In this work, we take a closer look at the method, and provide strong and intuitive error bounds that justify its excellent performance for low-rank approximation of matrix functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates model reduction techniques for nonlinear parameterized and time-dependent PDEs, specifically focusing on bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We develop interpretable and non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) capable of capturing dynamics associated with bifurcations by identifying a minimal set of coordinates. Our methodology combines the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method with a deep learning framework based on Autoencoder (AE) architectures. To enhance dimensionality reduction, we integrate a nested Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with the SINDy-AE architecture, enabling a sparse discovery of system dynamics while maintaining efficiency of the reduced model. We demonstrate our approach via two challenging test cases defined on sudden-expansion channel geometries: a symmetry-breaking bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. Starting from a comprehensive analysis of their high-fidelity behavior, i.e. symmetry-breaking phenomena and the rise of unsteady periodic solutions, we validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our ROMs. The results show successful reconstruction of the bifurcations, accurate prediction of system evolution for unseen parameter values, and significant speed-up compared to full-order methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretization Frameworks in the Strong Operator Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03069v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tomography is a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to investigate patients' interior features. The Radon transform (in two dimensions) is commonly used to model the measurement process in parallel-beam CT. Suitable discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection) is crucial. The most commonly used discretization approach combines what we refer to as the ray-driven Radon transform with what we refer to as the pixel-driven backprojection, as anecdotal reports describe these as showing the best approximation performance. However, there is little rigorous understanding of induced approximation errors. These methods involve three discretization parameters: the spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. Most commonly, balanced resolutions are used, i.e., the same (or similar) spatial- and detector resolutions are employed. We present an interpretation of ray- and pixel-driven discretizations as `convolutional methods', a special class of finite-rank operators. This allows for a structured analysis that can explain observed behavior. In particular, we prove convergence in the strong operator topology of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions, thus theoretically justifying this approach. In particular, with high enough resolutions one can approximate the Radon transform arbitrarily well. Numerical experiments corroborate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Parameter-robust preconditioner for Stokes-Darcy coupled problem with Lagrange multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a parameter-robust preconditioner for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem equipped with various boundary conditions, enforcing the mass conservation at the interface via a Lagrange multiplier. We rigorously establish that the coupled system is well-posed with respect to physical parameters and mesh size and provide a framework for constructing parameter-robust preconditioners. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Minimal Residual method in the presence of small outlier eigenvalues linked to specific boundary conditions, which can lead to slow convergence or stagnation. To address this issue, we employ deflation techniques to accelerate the convergence. Finally, Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds using Neural Variational Heat Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element approximation for the projection method to solve the Chemotaxis-Fluid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a chemotaxis-fluid interaction model governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the classical Keller-Segel chemotaxis system. To numerically solve this coupled system, we develop a pressure-correction projection finite element method based on a projection framework. The proposed scheme employs a backward Euler method for temporal discretization and a mixed finite element method for spatial discretization. Nonlinear terms are treated semi-implicitly to enhance computational stability and efficiency. We further establish rigorous error estimates for the fully discrete scheme, demonstrating the convergence of the numerical method. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the stability, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results confirm the scheme's capability to capture the essential dynamical behaviors and characteristic features of the chemotaxis-fluid system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of BDDC preconditioners for non-conforming polytopal hybrid discretisation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we build on the discrete trace theory developed by Badia, Droniou, and Tushar (Foundations of Computational Mathematics, in press, 2025; \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s10208-025-09734-6}{doi:10.1007/s10208-025-09734-6}) to analyze the convergence rate of the Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner generated from non-conforming polytopal hybrid discretizations. We prove polylogarithmic bounds on the condition number for the preconditioner that are independent of the mesh parameter and the number of subdomains, and that hold on polytopal meshes. The analysis relies on the continuity of a face truncation operator, which we establish in the fully discrete polytopal setting. To validate the theory, we present numerical experiments that confirm the truncation estimate and condition number bounds. In particular, we conduct weak scalability tests for second-order elliptic problems discretized using discontinuous skeletal methods, specifically Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) and Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods. We also demonstrate the robustness of the preconditioner for piecewise discontinuous coefficients with large jumps.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Method for Nonlocal Equations on Bounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces efficient and accurate spectral solvers for nonlocal equations on bounded domains. These spectral solvers exploit the fact that integration in the nonlocal formulation transforms into multiplication in Fourier space and that nonlocality is decoupled from the grid size, allowing fast and accurate solutions to the nonlocal problems. Our approach extends the spectral solvers developed by Alali and Albin (2020) for periodic domains by incorporating the two-dimensional Fourier continuation (2D-FC) algorithm introduced by Bruno and Paul (2022). We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on two-dimensional nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal diffusion equations defined on bounded domains. While the regularity of solutions to these equations in bounded settings remains an open problem, we conduct numerical experiments to explore this issue, particularly focusing on studying discontinuities.</description>

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation is a classical reaction-diffusion equation with broad applications such as biology, chemistry and physics. In this paper, an alternative second-order scheme is proposed by employing a shifted BDF2 method to approximate the two-dimensional (modified) Fisher-KPP equation. We both consider an uniform and a nonuniform time steps of such the scheme. The stability of the uniform discretization scheme is proved. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our uniform and non-uniform schemes are robust and accurate.</description>

      <title>Conforming lifting and adjoint consistency for the Discrete de Rham complex of differential forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete de Rham (DDR) methods provide non-conforming but compatible approximations of the continuous de Rham complex on general polytopal meshes. Owing to the non-conformity, several challenges arise in the analysis of these methods. In this work, we design conforming liftings on the DDR spaces, that are right-inverse of the interpolators and can be used to solve some of these challenges. We illustrate this by tackling the question of the global integration-by-part formula. By non-conformity of the discrete complex, this formula involves a residual -- which can be interpreted as a consistency error on the adjoint of the discrete exterior derivative -- on which we obtain, using the conforming lifting, an optimal bound in terms of the mesh size. Our analysis is carried out in the polytopal exterior calculus framework, which allows for unified proofs for all the spaces and operators in the DDR complex. Moreover, the liftings are explicitly constructed in finite element spaces on a simplicial submesh of the underlying polytopal mesh, which gives more control on the resulting functions (e.g., discrete trace and inverse inequalities).</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Fidelity Fixed Point Schemes with On-the-fly Reduced Order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general method for accelerating fixed point schemes for problems related to partial differential equations is presented in this article. The speedup is obtained by training a reduced-order model on-the-fly, removing the need to do an offline training phase and any dependence to a precomputed reduced basis (e.g. a fixed geometry or mesh). The surrogate model can adapt itself along the iterations because of an error criterion based on error propagation, ensuring the high fidelity of the converged result. Convergence results are given for a general class of fixed point problems with complex dependence structures between multiple auxiliary linear systems. The proposed algorithm is applied to the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations. The speedups obtained are significant, and the output of the method can be considered high-fidelity when compared to the reference solution.</description>

Abstract: We derive a numerical approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an axial symmetry. To do so we use a noncommutative Laplace operator defined on the space of finite dimensional hermitian matrices. This operator is derived from a foliation of the surface obtained under an $S^1$-action on the surface. We present numerical results in the case of the sphere and a generic ellipsoid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an acceleration framework for a class of iterative methods using the Reduced Order Method (ROM). Assuming that the underlying iterative scheme generates a rich basis for the solution space, we construct the next iterate by minimizing the equation error over the linear manifold spanned by this basis. The resulting optimal linear combination yields a more accurate approximation of the solution and significantly enhances convergence. In essence, the method can be seen as a history-based acceleration technique, akin to a delayed or memory-enhanced iterative scheme. This approach effectively remedies semi-ill-posed problems, enabling convergence where standard methods may fail, and also acts as a stabilizing and regularizing mechanism for the original iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

Our emphasis is on the development of methods that can efficiently follow complex solution features in space-time by refinement and coarsening at each time step on an adaptive quadtree. For simplicity, we focus on problems posed in a square domain with periodic boundary conditions. The performance and robustness of the methods are illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: High fidelity design evaluation processes such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis are often replaced with data driven surrogates to reduce computational cost in engineering design optimization. However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data. As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal. Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a preconditioned convex splitting algorithm enhanced by line search techniques for nonconvex optimization problems. The algorithm utilizes second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF) for the implicit components and employs the Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts of the gradient flow in variational problems. The resulting scheme can be interpreted as a varying (or dynamic) difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm. It integrates the Armijo line search strategy to improve performance. The study also discusses classical preconditioners such as symmetric Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi within this context. The global convergence of the algorithm is established through the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence under the preconditioned scheme. Numerical experiments demonstrate significantly higher efficiency than standard DC algorithms and other boosted algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-Trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GSM8K-level math-reasoning, GPT-2-level text, and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints, with consistent performance gains across models ranging from 200M to 8B. Our code is available at https://github.com/yuchen-zhu-zyc/DiscreteFastSolver.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient method for convex minimization problems involving total variation regularization on multidimensional domains. It relies on alternatively updating an active set of subsets of the spatial domain and an iterate given by a conic combination of the associated characteristic functions. Different to previous approaches in the same spirit, the computation of a new candidate set only requires the solution of one prescribed mean curvature problem, instead of the resolution of a fractional minimization task analogous to finding a generalized Cheeger set. After discretization, the former can be realized by a single run of a graph cut algorithm, leading to a significant speedup in practice. We prove the global sublinear convergence of the resulting method, under mild assumptions, and its asymptotic linear convergence in a more restrictive two-dimensional setting which uses results of stability of surfaces of prescribed mean curvature under perturbations of the curvature. Finally, we numerically demonstrate this convergence behavior in some model PDE-constrained minimization problems.</description>

      <title>Higher order stray field computation on tensor product domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the tensor grid method for stray field computation on rectangular domains that incorporates higher-order basis functions. Both the magnetization and the resulting magnetic field are represented using higher-order B-spline bases, which allow for increased accuracy and smoothness. The method employs a super-potential formulation, which circumvents the need to convolve with a singular kernel. The field is represented with high accuracy as a functional Tucker tensor, leveraging separable expansions on the tensor product domain and trained via a multilinear extension of the extreme learning machine methodology. Unlike conventional grid-based methods, the proposed mesh-free approach allows for continuous field evaluation. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating exponential convergence of the energy and linear computational scaling with respect to the multilinear expansion rank.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Macro-Model for Bistable Periodic Auxetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A macro-constitutive model for the deformation response of periodic rotating bistable auxetic surfaces is developed. Focus is placed on isotropic surfaces made of bistable hexagonal cells composed of six triangular units with two stable equilibrium states. Adopting a variational formulation, the effective stress-strain response is derived from a free energy function expressed in terms of the invariants of the logarithmic strain. To address the mathematical ill-posedness and numerical artifacts--such as mesh sensitivity--arising from the double-well nature of the free energy, two regularization approaches are introduced: (i) a gradient-enhanced first invariant of the logarithmic strain, and (ii) an artificial material rate dependency. Although neither regularization guarantees solution uniqueness, the former mitigates mesh sensitivity, while the latter improves the convergence behavior of the nonlinear numerical scheme by promoting smooth temporal evolution of transition localization and enabling the system to overcome snap-backs induced by local non-proportional loading near transition fronts. The model is implemented using membrane/shell structural elements and plane stress continuum ones within the ABAQUS finite element suite. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and its implementation.</description>

      <title>A Fast Relax-and-Round Approach to Unit Commitment for Data Center Own Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to "bring own generation" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with no accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.</description>
