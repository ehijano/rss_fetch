      <title>Measurement of B meson production fraction ratios in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using open-charm and charmonium decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production fraction ratios of B$^+$, B$^0$, and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ mesons are measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using a special data set recorded in 2018 with high-rate triggers designed to collect an unbiased sample of $10^{10}$ b hadrons with the CMS experiment at the LHC. These data allow the use of the open-charm decays of B mesons (B$_\mathrm{(s)}$ $\to$ $\pi$D$_\mathrm{(s)}$) where the D meson decays into fully hadronic final states. Production fraction ratios as functions of B meson transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and rapidity ($y$) are measured using the open-charm decays in the kinematic range of 8 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 60 GeV and $\lvert y \rvert$ $\lt$ 2.25. In addition, the same data are used to measure the relative production fraction ratios with the charmonium decay channels (B$_\mathrm{(s)}$ $\to$ X$\,$J/$\psi$ with X indicating a K$^+$, K$^*$(892)$^0$, or $\phi$(1020) meson) with the J/$\psi$ meson decaying into a pair of muons. By utilizing known branching fractions, precision theoretical calculations, and the open-charm results, the production fraction ratios in the charmonium samples are determined with an absolute normalization for the first time. These results also improve several world-average values of the ratios of branching fractions of B meson decays to charmonium and open-charm states. Finally, we test isospin invariance in B meson production in proton-proton collisions and observe that it holds within the experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Track Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High backgrounds and detector ageing impact the track finding in the Belle II central drift chamber, reducing both track purity and track efficiency in events. This necessitates the development of new track finding algorithms to mitigate detector performance degradation. Building on our previous success with an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider (arXiv:2411.13596), we have extended the algorithm to incorporate inputs from both the drift chamber and the silicon vertex tracking detector, creating a multi-modal network. We employ graph neural networks to handle the irregular detector structure and object condensation to address the unknown, varying number of particles in each event. This approach simultaneously identifies all tracks in an event and determines their respective parameters. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness using a realistic full detector simulation, which incorporates beam-induced backgrounds and noise modelled from actual collision data. The simultaneous reconstruction of the information from the two detectors yields a track efficiency improvement from 48.0 % to 74.7 % for uniformly displaced particles up to 100 cm, while increasing the track purity by 5.5 percentage points. We provide a detailed comparison of its track-finding performance against the current Belle II baseline across various event topologies.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and performance of an online data selection algorithm for liquid argon time projection chambers using MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MicroBooNE detector is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) that produces three-dimensional images of particle interactions using ionization charge collected by anode wire plane arrays and scintillation light collected by a light detection system. In addition to testing long-standing experimental neutrino anomalies and performing measurements of neutrino interactions with argon nuclei using the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, MicroBooNE aims to develop methodologies for rare beyond the Standard Model and off-beam physics searches. Looking ahead to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with MicroBooNE serving as a valuable testbed, achieving high sensitivity and livetime for off-beam physics while satisfying data processing and storage constraints will require data-driven, intelligent, and online or real-time data selection techniques. These techniques are essential for reducing data rates and preserving rare signals with high accuracy. In this paper, we describe a fast data selection algorithm suitable for online execution to identify electrons from stopping cosmic ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector utilizing ionization charge information, and present its performance. This represents the first demonstration of online data selection in a LArTPC using real data and charge information exclusively and provides an important proof-of-principle for applying such techniques to other LArTPC experiments such as the Short-Baseline Near Detector and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the three-loop unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements, with single- and two-mass corrections, and the associated deep-inelastic massive Wilson coefficients in the region $Q^2 \gg m_Q^2$, the calculation of which has been completed recently. We also provide fast and precise numerical representations of the massless Wilson coefficients, splitting functions to tree-loop order, and target-mass corrections in $x$-space well suited for QCD-fitting codes.</description>

      <title>Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($\Omega_\mathrm{DM}\sim\Omega_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.</description>

      <title>Structural dissection of hadronic molecules: The $D^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ family under QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the static electromagnetic properties of three charm--strange molecular tetraquark candidates with quantum numbers $J^{P}=1^{+}$, namely the $D\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $D^{\ast}\bar{K}$, and $D^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}$ systems. The analysis is carried out within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules, using interpolating currents constructed from colour-singlet meson bilinears to reflect their molecular configurations. Both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions are included,and numerical predictions for the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments are obtained. The magnetic moments are found to lie in the range $1$--$3$ nuclear magnetons, with the largest value associated with the $D^{*}\bar{K}$ configuration. The quadrupole moments are an order of magnitude smaller, of order $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{fm}^{2}$, indicating only weak deviations from spherical charge distributions. A flavour decomposition shows that the magnetic response is dominated by the light quarks, while the charm-quark contribution is strongly suppressed, a feature naturally expected for loosely bound hadronic molecules. The present analysis extends QCD light-cone sum-rule studies of exotic hadrons by providing a systematic determination of the electromagnetic moments of the $D^{(\ast)}\bar K^{(\ast)}$ molecular systems. These results provide quantitative benchmarks that may help discriminate between molecular configurations and more compact multiquark interpretations and may offer useful guidance for future experimental studies of electromagnetic signatures of charm--strange exotic states.</description>

      <title>Observation of flow vector fluctuations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}_{_{\bf NN}}}}=$ 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) dependent flow vector fluctuations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are presented. By studying long-range two-particle correlations with a template fit method, potential biases from non-flow effects such as jets and resonance decays are effectively suppressed. Significant $p_{\rm T}$- and $\eta$-dependent fluctuations of the second-harmonic flow vector are observed with more than 5$\sigma$ confidence in p$-$Pb collisions, similar to the observations in Pb$-$Pb collisions. The influence of residual non-flow effects has been evaluated and cannot account for the observed fluctuations, thereby confirming the observation of flow vector fluctuations in small collision systems at the LHC. Comparisons to model calculations from 3DGlauber+MUSIC+UrQMD and the parton transport model from AMPT are also presented. The measurements provide constraints on the theoretical modelling of the three-dimensional initial geometry and its event-by-event fluctuations, offering critical insights into the origin of collective flow in small collision systems at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and multiplicity-dependent pseudorapidity densities of charged particles in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s} = 13.6}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the pseudorapidity density of primary charged particles (${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/ {\rm d}\eta$) in $|\eta|&lt;1.5$ is measured in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV using the ALICE detector. Tracks are reconstructed with the upgraded Inner Tracking System and Time Projection Chamber, and results are reported for the INEL$&gt;$0 event class (events having at least one charged particle in $|\eta|&lt;1$). The multiplicity dependence of the pseudorapidity density of charged particles is also explored with the multiplicity determined by the forward detectors.
  The average charged-particle pseudorapidity density at midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;0.5$) is measured to be $\langle \mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{ch}}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle = 7.10 \pm 0.18$. Combined with lower-energy measurements, the INEL$&gt;$0 results follow a power-law scaling with the center-of-mass energy. These measurements provide a new reference for charged-particle production at the highest proton$-$proton collision energy available at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($\pi$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($\eta_c$, $\eta_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Reaching the quantum noise limit for interferometric measurement of optical nonlinearity in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics predicts that the vacuum must behave as a nonlinear optical medium:the vacuum optical index should increase when vacuum is stressed by intense electromagnetic fields.The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) project aims to measure it by using intense and ultra-short laser pulses delivered by the LASERIX facility at IJCLab (Paris-Saclay University). Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam. In this work, we present the experimentalvalidation of this novel method. The results demonstrate a robust path toward picometer-scalesensitivity and provide a key step toward the observation of QED-induced vacuum refraction.</description>

Abstract: We present flux-averaged charged-current $\nu_\mu$ cross-section measurements on argon for final states containing exactly one $\pi^\pm$ and no other hadrons except nucleons. The analysis uses data from the MicroBooNE experiment in the Booster Neutrino Beam, corresponding to $1.11 \times 10^{21}$ protons on target. Total and single-differential cross-section measurements are provided within a phase space restricted to muon momenta above 150 MeV, pion momenta above 100 MeV, and muon-pion opening angles smaller than 2.65 rad. Differential cross sections are reported with respect to the scattering angles of the muon and pion relative to the beam direction, their momenta, and their combined opening angle. The differential cross section with respect to muon momentum is based on a subset of selected events with the muon track fully contained in the detector, whereas the cross section with respect to pion momentum is based on a subset of selected events rich in pions that have not hadronically scattered on the argon before coming to rest. The latter has not been measured on argon before. The total cross section is measured as $(3.75~\pm~0.07~\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm~0.80~\textrm{(syst.)}) \times 10^{-38} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{Ar}$ at a mean energy of approximately 0.8 GeV. Comparisons of the measured cross sections with predictions from multiple neutrino-nucleus interaction generators show good overall agreement, except at very forward muon angles.</description>

      <title>Observation of the rare baryonic decay $B^{+}\rightarrow p \bar{\it{\Lambda}}$ and measurement of its weak decay parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observation of the decay $B^{+}\rightarrow p \bar{\it{\Lambda}}$ is presented, using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment between 2016 and 2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5.4\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The signal significance exceeds seven standard deviations. Using the $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{\mathrm{0}}_{\mathrm{S}} \pi^{+}$ decay as a normalization channel, the branching fraction is measured and combined with previous LHCb results based on data collected at 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012, yielding $\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\rightarrow p \bar{\it{\Lambda}})=(1.24\pm 0.17\pm 0.05\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-7}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third comes from the uncertainty on the branching fraction of the normalization channel. The $B^{+}\rightarrow p \bar{\it{\Lambda}}$ weak decay parameter is measured to be $\alpha_B = 0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.26} \pm 0.09$, indicating the presence of comparable S-wave and P-wave decay amplitudes.</description>

      <title>BitHEP -- The Limits of Low-Precision ML in HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Deconstructive Composite Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of composite dark matter that disassembles into a cascade while crossing the Earth. This occurs for loosely bound composite dark matter, where the binding energy per constituent is small, such that scattering with Standard Model nuclei typically imparts enough energy to dissociate a constituent from its composite. Trajectories and cascade profiles are found for dissociated constituents that are further diverted by scattering through the Earth. Such scattering cascades are a common feature of TeV-scale weakly-interacting dark matter loosely bound in composites. We identify underground detector signatures of constituent cascades that depend on composite characteristics; these signatures include non-collinear multiple scatters in detectors, parameter-dependent timing separation of multiscatter events, and regions of parameter space where a dark matter cascade would leave a coincident signature in different underground laboratories.</description>

      <title>Probing $\alpha$ clustering in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at CSR energies using the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of low-energy nuclear collisions to intrinsic nuclear structure by studying the interplay between initial-state geometry and final-state observables in C+C and C+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.36$~GeV, relevant for experiments at the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility in Lanzhou and forthcoming experiments at the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) in Huizhou. Calculations are performed within the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM) using Woods--Saxon and triangular $\alpha$-clustered configurations for the $^{12}C$ nucleus. The initial geometry is characterized in terms of transverse size, compactness, eccentricities, and their ensemble-averaged fluctuations. We find that $\alpha$ clustering leads to a more compact participant configuration than the Woods--Saxon case, while transverse-size and eccentricity fluctuations show only weak sensitivity to clustering. At this beam energy, radial observables remain sensitive to geometric compactness, with the ensemble-averaged proton mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ enhanced for $\alpha$-clustered configurations, whereas pions show little sensitivity. The anisotropic response is examined using flow harmonic coefficients. We find an enhancement of the root-mean-square flow magnitudes, $v_n\{2\} = \sqrt{\langle v_n^2\rangle}$, for $\alpha$-clustered configurations at large $N_{part}$, while the ensemble-averaged fluctuation strength of individual harmonics remains small. Symmetric cumulants of the initial-state eccentricities show sensitivity to clustering, whereas the corresponding ensemble-averaged correlations among final-state flow harmonics do not exhibit a comparably strong separation. These results indicate that radial observables and correlation-based flow measurements provide complementary probes of $\alpha$ clustering in low-energy nuclear collisions.</description>
