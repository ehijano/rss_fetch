      <title>The hyperplane of early-type galaxies: using stellar population properties to increase the precision and accuracy of the fundamental plane as a distance indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use deep spectroscopy from the SAMI Galaxy Survey to explore the precision of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies (FP) as a distance indicator for future single-fibre spectroscopy surveys. We study the optimal trade-off between sample size and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and investigate which additional observables can be used to construct hyperplanes with smaller intrinsic scatter than the FP. We add increasing levels of random noise (parametrised as effective exposure time) to the SAMI spectra to study the effect of increasing measurement uncertainties on the FP-and hyperplane-inferred distances. We find that, using direct-fit methods, the values of the FP and hyperplane best-fit coefficients depend on the spectral SNR, and reach asymptotic values for a mean SNR=40 {\AA}$^{-1}$. As additional variables for the FP we consider three stellar-population observables: light-weighted age, stellar mass-to-light ratio and a novel combination of Lick indices (I$_{\rm age}$). For a SNR=45 {\AA}$^{-1}$ (equivalent to 1-hour exposure on a 4-m telescope), all three hyperplanes outperform the FP as distance indicators. Being an empirical spectral index, I$_{\rm age}$ avoids the model-dependent uncertainties and bias underlying age and mass-to-light ratio measurements, yet yields a 10 per cent reduction of the median distance uncertainty compared to the FP. We also find that, as a by-product, the Iage hyperplane removes most of the reported environment bias of the FP. After accounting for the different signal-to-noise ratio, these conclusions also apply to a 50 times larger sample from SDSS-III. However, in this case, only age removes the environment bias.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Superwinds with Time-evolving Stellar Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-loss and radiation feedback from evolving massive stars produce galactic-scale superwinds, sometimes surrounded by pressure-driven bubbles. Using the time-dependent stellar population typically seen in star-forming regions, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations of a starburst-driven superwind model coupled with radiative efficiency rates to investigate the formation of radiative cooling superwinds and bubbles. Our numerical simulations depict the parameter space where radiative cooling superwinds with or without bubbles occur. Moreover, we employ the physical properties and time-dependent ionization states to predict emission line profiles under the assumption of collisional ionization and non-equilibrium ionization caused by wind thermal feedback in addition to photoionization created by the radiation background. We see the dependence of non-equilibrium ionization structures on the time-evolving ionizing source, leading to a deviation from collisional ionization in radiative cooling wind regions over time.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Structure Formation: the Early Emergence of Massive Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies in the early universe appear to have grown too big too fast, assembling into massive, monolithic objects more rapidly than anticipated in the hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM structure formation paradigm. The available data are consistent with there being a population of massive galaxies that form early ($z \gtrsim 10$) and follow an approximately exponential star formation history with a short ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) e-folding timescale on the way to becoming massive ($M_* \approx 10^{11}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) galaxies by $z = 0$, consistent with the traditional picture for the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies. Observations of the kinematics of spiral galaxies as a function of redshift similarly show that massive disks and their scaling relations were in place at early times, indicating a genuine effect in mass that cannot be explained as a quirk of luminosity evolution. That massive galaxies could form by $z = 10$ was explicitly predicted in advance by MOND. We discuss some further predictions of MOND, such as the early emergence of clusters of galaxies and the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Galactic Rotation Curves of LSB Galaxies using core-halo FDM configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct galactic halos in order to fit the rotation curves (RCs) of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These halos are made of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with a multimode expansion of non-spherical modes that in average contribute to the appropriate density profile consisting of a core and an envelope needed to fit the rotation curves. These halos are constructed assuming a solitonic core at the center and two types of envelopes, Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal density profiles. The resulting FDM configurations are then evolved in order to show how the average density changes in time due to the secular dynamical evolution, along with a condensation process that lead to the growth of the solitonic core.</description>

      <title>UVIT Survey of AGN host Galaxies -- I: Star Formation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumnuclear star formation (SF) is generally seen in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN); however, the connection between the AGN activity and SF in them is less well understood. To explore this connection on scales of a few tens of parsec to a few tens of kiloparsec and larger, we carried out an investigation of SF in seven Seyfert type AGN and one LINER galaxy, using observations with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board {\it AstroSat} in the near ultra-Violet (NUV; 2000-3000 \AA) and far ultra-Violet (FUV; 2000-3000 \AA) bands. A total of 1742 star-forming regions were identified, having size scales of 0.010 to 63.642 kpc$^2$. Considering all the galaxies, we found a positive correlation between their total surface density of SF ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and extinction. For five galaxies, namely NGC 1365, NGC 4051, NGC 4321, NGC 5033 and NGC 6814, we found a gradual decrease of both extinction and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ from the centre to the outer regions. Four sources are found to lie in the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies, and the other four are away from MS. We found the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) in the nuclear region to the total SFR to be positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. This points to the influence of AGN on enhancing the SF characteristics of the hosts. However, the impact is dominant only in the central nuclear region with no significant effect on the larger scales probed in this work.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spectroscopy without spectra: Galaxy properties from photometric images with conditional diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative AI method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broad-band images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multi-band galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64x64-pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B-V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep-learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.</description>

      <title>Wide-binary eccentricity distribution in young star clusters: dependence on the binary separation and mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wide-binary eccentricity ($e$) distribution in young star clusters and the role of turbulence in setting the form of the $e$ distribution using magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster formation. The simulations incorporate gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, protostellar heating, and jets/outflows. We find that (1) simulations that employ purely compressive turbulence driving produce binaries with a superthermal $e$ distribution ($\alpha&gt;1$ in $p(e) \propto e^\alpha$), while simulations with purely solenoidal driving or natural mixture of driving modes produce subthermal/thermal distributions ($\alpha \leq$ 1), (2) the $e$ distribution over the full range of binary separations in our simulations is set at the early stages of the star cluster formation process, (3) while binaries (separation of $r_{\mathrm{pair}} \leq 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have subthermal to thermal $e$ distributions ($\alpha \sim 0.8$), wide binaries ($r_{\mathrm{pair}} &gt; 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have a superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 1.8$), and (4) low-mass binary systems (system masses of $M_{\mathrm{sys}} \leq 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) have a highly superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 2.4$), whereas high-mass systems ($M_{\mathrm{sys}} &gt; 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) exhibit a subthermal/thermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 0.8$). The binary eccentricity distribution is often modelled as a thermal distribution. However, our results suggest that the $e$ distribution depends on the range of separation of the sampled binaries, which agrees with the findings from recent Gaia observations. We conclude that the dependence of the $e$ distribution on the binary separation and mass is linked to the binary formation mechanism governed by the turbulent properties of the parent cloud.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: MIRI uncovers Virgil, an extended source at $z\simeq 6.6$ with the photometric properties of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Virgil, a MIRI extremely red object (MERO) detected with the F1000W filter as part of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Virgil is a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{spec} = 6.6312\pm 0.0019$ (from VLT/MUSE) with a rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) typical of LAEs at similar redshifts. However, MIRI observations reveal an unexpected extremely red color at rest-frame near-infrared wavelengths, $\rm F444W - F1000W = 2.33 \pm 0.06$. Such steep rise in the near-infrared, completely missed without MIRI imaging, is poorly reproduced by models including only stellar populations and hints towards the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Interestingly, the overall SED shape of Virgil resembles that of the recently discovered population of Little Red Dots (LRDs) but does not meet their compactness criterion: at rest-frame UV-optical wavelengths Virgil's morphology follows a 2D-S\'ersic profile with average index $n = 0.93^{+0.85}_{-0.31}$ and $r_e = 0.43$~pkpc. Only at MIRI wavelengths Virgil is unresolved due to the coarser PSF. We also estimate a bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol} = (8.4-11.1)\times 10^{44}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and a supermassive black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = (4-7)\times 10^7\rm ~ M_\odot$ in agreement with recently reported values for LRDs. This discovery demonstrates the crucial importance of deep MIRI surveys to find AGN amongst high-$z$ galaxies that otherwise would be completely missed and raises the question of how common Virgil-like objects could be in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Radio continuum emission from a tidal dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) form in the debris of galaxy mergers, making them ideal testbeds for investigating star formation in an extreme environment. We present radio continuum EVLA observations spanning 1-2 GHz of the interacting system Arp 94, which contains the TDG J1023+1952. We detect extended radio continuum emission from the disc of the TDG's putative parent galaxy, the spiral NGC 3227. The TDG lies in front of the spiral disc, partially overlapping in projection. This challenging alignment complicates the separation of the respective contributions of radio emission from the TDG and disc. However, we show that the radio continuum appears more prominent around the TDG's location, suggesting the detection of emission from the TDG. Quantifying this argument, we derive an upper limit of 2.2 mJy for the whole TDG's emission. Our derived in-band spectral index map of the system generally shows the expected behaviour of combined thermal and synchrotron radio emission in a galaxy disc, except for a region at the periphery of the disc and the TDG with a flat spectrum (spectral index ~-0.4) unrelated to regions with high H alpha emission. We speculate that at this location - which coincides with the intersection of faint tidal tails - the collision of gas clouds produces shocks which re-accelerate cosmic ray electrons, and thereby enhance the radio emission. Overall, this study provides new insights about the Arp 94 system and expands the sample of TDGs studied at radio frequencies, with only two confirmed detections so far.</description>

      <title>JWST, ALMA, and Keck Spectroscopic Constraints on the UV Luminosity Functions at z~7-14: Clumpiness and Compactness of the Brightest Galaxies in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at $z\sim7-14$. Our sample is composed of 53 galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}\sim7-14$, including recently-confirmed galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=12.34-14.32$ with JWST, as well as new confirmations at $z_\mathrm{spec}=6.583-7.643$ with $-24&lt; M_\mathrm{UV}&lt; -21$ mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at $z\sim10-13$ identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at $z\sim3-4$, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at $z&gt;10$. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that $\sim70\%$ of the bright galaxies at $z\sim7$ exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple sub-components, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At $z\gtrsim10$, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies; extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including NIV]$\lambda$1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ and are responsible for their overabundance.</description>

      <title>Cloud structure and young star distribution in the Dragonfish complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to shed some light on the star formation process this process is to analyse the relationship between the spatial distributions of gas and newly formed stars. In order to obtain robust results, it is necessary for this comparison to be made using quantitative and consistent descriptors applied to the same star-forming region. Here, we use fractal analysis to characterise and compare in a self-consistent way the structure of the cloud and the distribution of young stellar objects (YSO) in the Dragonfish star-forming complex. We used different emission maps of the Dragonfish Nebula and photometric information from the AllWISE catalogue to select a total of 1082 YSOs in the region, for some of which we derived physical properties from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For both datasets (cloud images and YSOs), the three-dimensional fractal dimension (Df) was calculated using previously developed and calibrated algorithms. The fractal dimension of the Dragonfish Nebula (Df = 2.6-2.7) agrees very well with values previously obtained for the Orion, Ophiuchus, and Perseus clouds. On the other hand, YSOs exhibit on average a significantly smaller value (Df = 1.9-2.0) that indicates a much more clumpy structure than the material from which they formed. This is a clear and direct evidence that the clustering degree of the newly born stars is significantly higher than that of the parent cloud from which they formed, but the physical mechanism behind this behaviour is still not clear. Additionally, younger Class I and Class II sources have smaller values (Df = 1.7 +/- 0.1) than more evolved Transition Disk objects (Df = 2.2 +/- 0.1), evidencing a certain evolutionary effect where an initially clumpy structure tends to gradually disappear over time.</description>

      <title>A 3 mm spectral line study of the Central Molecular Zone infrared dark cloud G1.75-0.08</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are fruitful objects to study the fragmentation of interstellar filaments and initial conditions and early stages of high-mass ($M&gt;8$ M$_{\odot}$) star formation. We used the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m radio telescopes to carry out the first single-pointing spectral line observations towards the IRDC G1.75-0.08, which is a filamentary Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) cloud. Our aim is to reach an improved understanding of the gas kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud and its two clumps that we call clumps A and B. We also aim to determine the fractional abundances of the molecules detected at 3 mm towards G1.75-0.08. We detected HNCO$(J_{K_a,\,K_c}=4_{0,\,4}-3_{0,\,3})$, HCN$(J=1-0)$, and HCO$^+(J=1-0)$ towards both clumps. The N$_2$H$^+(J=1-0)$ line was detected only in clump B, while N$_2$D$^+(J=1-0)$ was not detected at all. The HCN and HNCO spectra exhibit two velocity components. The abundances of the detected species are comparable to those in other IRDCs. An upper limit to the [N$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$H$^+$] deuterium fraction of $&lt;0.05$ derived towards clump B is consistent with values observed in many high-mass clumps. The line mass analysis suggests that the G1.75-0.08 filament is subcritical by a factor of $11\pm6$, and the clumps were found to be gravitationally unbound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} &gt; 2$). Our finding that G1.75-0.08 is strongly subcritical is atypical compared to the general population of Galactic filamentary clouds. The cloud's location in the CMZ might affect the cloud kinematics similar to what has been found for the Brick IRDC, and the cloud's dynamical state might also be the result of the turbulent motions or shear and tidal forces in the CMZ. Because the target clumps are dark at 70 $\mu$m and massive (several $10^3$ M$_{\odot}$), they can be considered candidates for being high-mass starless (but not prestellar) clumps.</description>

      <title>Playing with FIRE: A Galactic Feedback-Halting Experiment Challenges Star Formation Rate Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback influences the star formation rate (SFR) and the interstellar medium of galaxies in ways that are difficult to quantify numerically, because feedback is an essential ingredient of realistic simulations. To overcome this, we conduct a feedback-halting experiment starting with a Milky Way-mass galaxy in the FIRE-2 simulation framework. Terminating feedback, and comparing to a simulation in which feedback is maintained, we monitor how the runs diverge. We find that without feedback, interstellar turbulent velocities decay. There is a marked increase of dense material, while the SFR increases by over an order of magnitude. Importantly, this SFR boost is a factor of $\sim$15-20 larger than is accounted for by the increased free fall rate caused by higher densities. This implies that feedback moderates the star formation efficiency per free-fall time more directly than simply through the density distribution. To probe changes at the scale of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we identify GMCs using density and virial parameter thresholds, tracking clouds as the galaxy evolves. Halting feedback stimulates rapid changes, including a proliferation of new bound clouds, a decrease of turbulent support in loosely-bound clouds, an overall increase in cloud densities, and a surge of internal star formation. Computing the cloud-integrated SFR using several theories of turbulence regulation, we show that these theories underpredict the surge in SFR by at least a factor of three. We conclude that galactic star formation is essentially feedback-regulated on scales that include GMCs, and that stellar feedback affects GMCs in multiple ways.</description>

      <title>Size matters: are we witnessing super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift black holes from JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope of the Universe at $z\gtrsim 4$ have shown that massive black holes (MBHs) appear extremely overmassive compared to the local correlation for active galactic nuclei. In some cases, these objects might even reach half the stellar mass inferred for the galaxy. Understanding how such objects formed and grew to this masses has then become a big challenge for theoretical models, with different ideas ranging from heavy seed to super-Eddington accretion phases. Here, we take a different approach, and try to infer how accurate these MBH mass estimates are and whether we really need to revise our physical models. By considering how the emerging spectrum (both the continuum and the broad lines) of an accreting MBH changes close to and above the Eddington limit, we infer a much larger uncertainty in the MBH mass estimates relative to that of local counterparts, up to an order of magnitude, and a potential preference for lower masses and higher accretion rates, which i) move them closer to the local correlations, and ii) might indicate that we are witnessing for the first time a widespread phase of very rapid accretion.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological parameters using the splashback radius of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ can be measured indirectly using various methods, including galaxy cluster abundance and cosmic shear. These measurements constrain the composite parameter $S_{8}$, leading to degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$. However, some structural properties of galaxy clusters also correlate with cosmological parameters, due to their dependence on a cluster's accretion history. In this work, we focus on the splashback radius, an observable cluster feature that represents a boundary between a cluster and the surrounding Universe. Using a suite of cosmological simulations with a range of values for $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$, we show that the position of the splashback radius around cluster-mass halos is greater in cosmologies with smaller values of $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ or larger values of $\sigma_{8}$. This variation breaks the degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ that comes from measurements of the $S_{8}$ parameter. We also show that this variation is, in principle, measurable in observations. As the splashback radius can be determined from the same weak lensing analysis already used to estimate $S_{8}$, this new approach can tighten low-redshift constraints on cosmological parameters, either using existing data, or using upcoming data such as that from Euclid and LSST.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution imaging survey of massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $&lt;$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.</description>

      <title>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor's circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1--0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a radio jet in the changing-look AGN 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency (5-345 GHz) and multi-resolution radio observations of 1ES 1927+654, widely considered one of the most unusual and extreme changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN). The source was first designated a CL-AGN after an optical outburst in late 2017 and has since displayed considerable changes in X-ray emission, including the destruction and rebuilding of the X-ray corona in 2019-2020. Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source not unusual for radio-quiet AGN. Starting in February 2023, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for nearly a year. The 5-23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than ~1000 years old. Recent high-resolution VLBA observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of 0.14 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3-2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios. This source joins a growing number of CL-AGN and tidal disruption events which show late-time radio activity, years after the initial outburst.</description>

      <title>TeV $\gamma$-ray emission near globular cluster Terzan 5 as a probe of cosmic ray transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays travelling through interstellar space have their propagation directions repeatedly scattered by fluctuating interstellar magnetic fields. The nature of this scattering is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics, one that has resisted solution largely due to a lack of direct observational constraints on the scattering rate. Here we show that very high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the globular cluster Terzan 5, which has unexpectedly been found to be displaced from the cluster, presents a direct probe of this process. We show that this displacement is naturally explained by cosmic rays accelerated in the bow shock around the cluster propagating a finite distance before scattering processes re-orient enough of them towards Earth to produce a detectable $\gamma$-ray signal. The angular distance between the cluster and the signal places tight constraints on the scattering rate, which we show are consistent with a model whereby scattering is primarily due to excitation of magnetic waves by the cosmic rays themselves. The analysis method we develop here will make it possible to use sources with similarly displaced non-thermal X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray signals as direct probes of cosmic ray scattering across a range of Galactic environments.</description>

      <title>The impact of constrained interacting dark energy on the bound-zone velocity profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the effects of constrained interacting dark energy (CIDER) on the bound-zone velocity profiles around massive dark matter halos. Analyzing the CIDER simulations performed by Baldi (2023) for three different cases of dark sector coupling ($\beta=0.03$, $0.05$ and $0.08$) as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology ($\beta=0$), we determine the mean peculiar velocity profiles in the bound zones around the friends-of-friends halos with masses larger than $M_{\rm cut}=3\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at three redshifts, $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$. It is found that the universal power-law formula proposed by Falco et al. (2024) originally for the $\Lambda$CDM case still describes well the bound-zone velocity profiles, $V(r)$, even in the CIDER models. The slope of $V(r)$, turns out to be significantly affected by the CIDER, progressively decreasing as $\beta$ increases. Meanwhile, the amplitude of $V(r)$ exhibits little dependence on $\beta$, which is ascribed to the identical Hubble parameters shared by the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models in the entire redshift range. Our results imply that the bound-zone velocity slope can break a degeneracy even between the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models with $\beta\le 0.03$, which the standard cosmological diagnostics fail to distinguish. We devise a simple analytic formula for the bound-zone slope as a function of $\beta$, and prove its validity at all of the three redshifts. It is concluded that the slope of the mean bound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be in principle a powerful probe of dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stellar Rotation of Early-type Stars in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey. III. Evolution</title>

Abstract: Stellar rotation significantly shapes the evolution of massive stars, yet the interplay of mass and metallicity remains elusive, limiting our capacity to construct accurate stellar evolution models and to better estimate the impact of rotation in chemical evolution of galaxies. Our goal is to investigate how mass and metallicity influence the rotational evolution of A-type stars on the main sequence (MS). We seek to identify deviations in rotational behaviors that could serve as new constraints to existing stellar models. Using the LAMOST median-resolution survey Data Release 9, we derived stellar parameters for a population of 104,752 A-type stars. Our study focused on the evolution of surface rotational velocities and their dependence on mass and metallicity in 84,683 `normal' stars. Normalized surface rotational revealed a prevailing evolutionary profile from 1.7 to 4.0 $M_\odot$. This profile features an initial rapid acceleration until $t/t_\mathrm{ms} = 0.25$, potentially a second acceleration peak near $t/t_\mathrm{ms} = 0.55$ for stars heavier than 2.5 $M_\odot$, followed by a steady decline and a `hook' feature at the end. Surpassing theoretical expectations, the initial acceleration likely stems from a concentrated distribution of angular momentum at ZAMS, resulting in a prolonged increase in speed. The inverse circulation becomes more efficient at lower metallicity, explaining the correlation of the slope of this deceleration phase with metallicity from -0.3 dex up to 0.1 dex. The metal-poor subsample suggests a mechanism dependent on metallicity for removing angular momentum during star formation. The proportion of fast rotators decreases with an increase in metallicity, up to $\log(Z/Z_\odot)\sim -0.2$, a trend consistent with observations of OB-type stars found in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing a decade-long unTimely dataset, supplemented by multi-band data from archives, we search for young stellar objects (YSOs) with variations larger than one magnitude in W1 band within a region of 110 square degrees in the Galactic plane, covered by VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV). A total of 641 candidate YSOs have been identified. We classified them into bursts, dips, faders, seculars, and irregulars. Within the burst category, 18 sources were identified as FUor candidates and 1 as an EXor candidate. Irregulars are the most prevalent in the sample. In both bursts and faders, the redder sources tend to show a pattern of bluer when brighter, whereas the bluer sources display the opposite trend, possibly related to the accretion structure of YSOs at different stages. Finally, we obtained the recurrence time scale for FUor eruptions at various stages of YSO evolution. Our findings indicate that younger YSOs generally experience more frequent eruptions compared to older ones.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the stellar ages of dynamically separated bulges and disks of CALIFA spiral galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a recently developed population-orbit superposition technique to simultaneously fit the stellar kinematic and age maps of 82 CALIFA spiral galaxies and obtain the ages of stars in different dynamical structures. We first evaluated the capabilities of this method on CALIFA-like mock data created from the Auriga simulations. The recovered mean ages of dynamically cold, warm, and hot components match the true values well, with an observational error of up to $20\%$ in the mock age maps. For CALIFA spiral galaxies, we find that the stellar ages of the cold, warm, and hot components all increase with the stellar mass of the galaxies, from $\overline{t_{\rm cold}}\sim2.2$ Gyr, $\overline{t_{\rm warm}}\sim2.3$ Gyr, and $\overline{t_{\rm hot}}\sim2.6$ Gyr for galaxies with stellar mass $M_*&lt;10^{10}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, to $\overline{t_{\rm cold}}\sim4.0$ Gyr, $\overline{t_{\rm warm}}\sim5.1$ Gyr, and $\overline{t_{\rm hot}}\sim5.9$ Gyr for galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{11}\,\rm M_{\odot}$. About $80\%$ of the galaxies in our sample have $t_{\rm hot}&gt;t_{\rm cold}$, and the mean values of $t_{\rm hot}-t_{\rm cold}$ also increase with stellar mass, from $0.7_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Gyr in low-mass galaxies ($10^{8.9}\,\rm M_{\odot}&lt;M_*\le10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) to $1.7_{-0.2}^{+0.7}$ Gyr in high-mass galaxies ($10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}&lt;M_*&lt;10^{11.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$). The stellar age is younger in disks than in bulges, on average. This suggests that either the disks formed later and/or that they experienced a more prolonged and extensive period of star formation. Lower-mass spiral galaxies have younger bulges and younger disks, while higher-mass spiral galaxies generally have older bulges, and their disks span a wide range of ages. This is consistent with the scenario in which the bulges in more massive spirals formed earlier than those in less massive spirals.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in the centers of galaxies: synergy between stellar flybys and tidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic centers are very dynamically active environments, often harbouring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the galactic center and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster's tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ~10-30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of $j_z$ driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ~10-100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase-space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in galaxy centers by promoting the tidal field-driven eccentricity excitation.</description>

      <title>Overview and public data release of the augmented Auriga Project: cosmological simulations of dwarf and Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended suite of the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical "zoom-in" simulations of 40 Milky Way-mass halos and 26 dwarf galaxy-mass halos run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. Auriga adopts the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming main sequence, and HI gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that star-forming gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for $z\gtrsim 3$ before they "settle" into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios ($V/\sigma$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H$\alpha$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilise the released data.</description>

      <title>HOMERUN a new approach to photoionization modelling. I -- reproducing observed emission lines with percent accuracy and obtaining accurate physical properties of the ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present HOMERUN (Highly Optimized Multi-cloud Emission-line Ratios Using photo-ionizatioN), a new approach to modelling emission lines from photoionized gas that can simultaneously reproduce all observed line intensities from a wide range of ionization levels and with high accuracy. Our approach is based on the weighted combination of multiple single-cloud photoionization models and, contrary to previous works, the novelty of our approach consists in using the weights as free parameters of the fit and constraining them with the observed data. One of the main applications of HOMERUN is the accurate determination of gas-phase metallicities and we show that a critical point is to allow for a variation of the N/O and S/O abundance ratios which can significantly improve the quality of the fit and the accuracy of the results. Moreover, our approach provides a major improvement compared to the single-cloud, constant-pressure models commonly used in the literature. By using high-quality literature spectra of H ii regions where 10 to 20 emission lines (including several auroral lines) are detected with high signal-to-noise ratio, we show that all lines are reproduced by the model with an accuracy better than 10%. In particular, the model is able to simultaneously reproduce [O i]6300, 6363, [O ii]3726, 3729, [O iii]4959, 5007, [S ii]6717, 6731, and [S iii]9069, 9532 emission lines which, to our knowledge, is an unprecedented result. Finally, we show that the gas metallicities estimated with our models for HII regions in the Milky Way are in agreement with the stellar metallicities than the estimates based on the Te-method. Overall, our method provides a new accurate tool to estimate the metallicity and the physical conditions of the ionized gas. It can be applied to many different science cases from HII regions to AGN and wherever there are emission lines from photoionized gas.</description>

      <title>The fundamental plane of black hole activity for low-luminosity radio active galactic nuclei across 1 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental plane of black hole activity (BHFP) describes the correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$), X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass. It reflects a disc-jet connection. However, dependence of BHFP on various physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and host galaxies is unclear, especially for low-luminosity AGNs, which is important for understanding accretion physics in AGNs. Here we explore the dependence of BHFP on radio loudness, Eddington ratio ($\lambda_E$), redshift, and galaxy star formation properties at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4 for radio AGNs. Based on current deep and large surveys, our studies extend to low luminosities and high redshifts. From GOODS and COSMOS fields, we constructed a homogeneous radio AGN sample including 208 objects. We divided the radio AGN sample into 141 radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs and 67 radio-loud (RL) AGNs according to the radio loudness defined by the $L_R$-to-$L_X$ ratio. This ratio shows a bimodal distribution that is well described by two Gaussian models. Their cross point corresponds to a radio loudness threshold of $\log (L_R/L_X) = -2.73$. RQ and RL AGNs show different BHFPs, indicating a dependence of BHFP on the radio loudness. For both RQ and RL AGNs, BHFP shows a dependence on $\lambda_E$, but no dependence on redshift. BHFP shows a dependence on the galaxy star formation properties for RQ AGNs, while for RL AGNs this dependence disappears. BHFP sheds important light on the accretion physics and X-ray emission origins. X-ray emission of RQ AGNs originates from a combination of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and synchrotron radiation from jet at $0.01 &lt; \lambda_E &lt; 0.1$, and from jet at $0.1 &lt; \lambda_E &lt; 1$. X-ray emission in RL AGNs originates from a combination of ADAF and jet at $\lambda_E &lt; 0.01$, from jet at $0.01 &lt; \lambda_E &lt; 0.1$, and from a combination of standard thin disc and jet at $\lambda_E &gt; 0.1$.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI unveils the stellar component of the GN20 dusty galaxy overdensity at $z$=4.05</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the importance of the dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z$&gt;2 for understanding the galaxy evolution in the early Universe, their stellar distributions traced by the near-IR emission were spatially unresolved until the arrival of the JWST. In this work we present, for the first time, a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame near-IR (~1.1-3.5$\mu$m) emission in DSFGs traced with the JWST/MIRI. In particular, we study the mature stellar component for the three DSFGs and a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) present in an overdensity at $z$=4.05. Moreover, we use MIRI images along with UV to (sub)-mm ancillary photometric data to model their SEDs and extract their main physical properties. The sub-arcsec resolution MIRI images have revealed that the stellar component present a wide range of morphologies, from disc-like to compact and clump-dominated structures. These near-IR structures contrast with their UV emission, which is usually diffuse and off-centered. The SED fitting analysis shows that GN20 dominates the total SFR with a value ~2500 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ while GN20.2b has the highest stellar mass in the sample ($M_*$~2$\times$10$^{11}$ $M_\odot$). The two DSFGs classified as LTGs (GN20 and GN20.2a) show high specific SFR (sSFR&gt;30 Gyr$^{-1}$) placing them above the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at z~4 by &gt;0.5 dex while the ETG (i.e.,GN20.2b) is compatible with the high-mass end of the main sequence. When comparing with other DSFGs in overdensities at $z$~2-7 we observe that our objects present similar SFRs, depletion times and projected separations. Nevertheless, the effective radii computed for GN20 and GN20.2a are up to two times larger than those of isolated galaxies observed in CEERS and ALMA-HUDF at similar redshifts. We interpret this difference in size as an effect of rapid growth induced by the dense environment.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of an ionized bubble: NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the $z=6.6$ double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter COLA1 and its environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasingly neutral intergalactic gas at $z&gt;6$ impacts the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux observed from galaxies. One luminous galaxy, COLA1, stands out because of its unique double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line at $z=6.6$, unseen in any simulation of reionization. Here we present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy in a 21 arcmin$^2$ field centered on COLA1. We find 141 galaxies spectroscopically-selected through the [OIII]($\lambda4969,5008$) doublet at $5.35&lt;z&lt;6.95$, with 40 of these sources showing H$\beta$. For COLA1 we additionally detect [OIII]$_{4363}$ and H$\gamma$. We measure a systemic redshift of $z=6.5917$ for COLA1, confirming the double-peak nature of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. This implies that it resides in a highly ionized bubble and that it is leaking ionizing photons with a high escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}{\rm (LyC)}=20$-$50$%, making it a prime laboratory to study Lyman continuum escape in the Epoch of Reionization. COLA1 shows all the signs of a prolific ionizer with a Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $81\pm5\%$, Balmer decrement indicating no dust, a steep UV slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}=-3.2\pm 0.4$), and a star-formation surface density $\gtrsim 10\times$ that of typical galaxies at similar redshift. We detect 5 galaxies in COLA1's close environment ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$). Exploiting the high spectroscopic completeness inherent to grism surveys, and using mock simulations that mimic the selection function, we show the that number of detected companions is very typical for a similarly UV-bright ($M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-21.3$) galaxy; that is, the ionized bubble around COLA1 is unlikely due to an excessively large over-density. Instead, the measured ionizing properties suggest that COLA1 by itself might be powering the bubble required to explain its double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile ($R_{\rm ion}\approx0.7$ pMpc), with minor contribution from detected neighbours ($-17.5&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-19.5$).</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in the quasi-linear formulation of modified Newtonian dynamics (QuMOND)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We explore the dynamical friction on a test mass in gravitational systems in the Quasi linear formulation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (QuMOND). Methods. Exploiting the quasi linearity of QuMOND we derive a simple expression for the dynamical friction in akin to its Newtonian counterpart in the standard Chandrasekhar derivation. Moreover, adopting a mean field approach based on the Liouville equation we obtain a more rigorous (though in integral form) dynamical friction formula that can be evaluated numerically for a given choice of the QuMOND interpolation function. Results. Consistently with previous work, we observe that dynamical friction is stronger in MOND with respect to a baryon only Newtonian system with the same mass distribution. This amounts to a correction of the Coulomb logarithmic factor via extra terms proportional to the MOND radius of the system. Moreover, with the aid of simple numerical experiments we confirm our theoretical predictions and those of previous work on MOND.</description>

      <title>Blueberry galaxies up to 200 Mpc and their optical and infrared properties</title>

Abstract: Dwarf highly star-forming galaxies (SFGs) dominated the early Universe and are considered the main driver of its reionization. However, direct observations of these distant galaxies are mainly confined to rest-frame ultraviolet and visible light, limiting our understanding of their complete properties. Therefore, it is still paramount to study their local analogs, the green pea (GP) and blueberry (BB) galaxies. This work aims to expand our knowledge of BBs by identifying a new sample that is closer and in the southern sky. In addition to the already known BBs, this new sample will allow for a statistically significant study of their properties probed by visible and infrared (IR) light. By utilizing the HECATE catalog, which provides photometry and characterization of galaxies, along with data from Pan-STARSS and SDSS, this study selects and analyzes a new sample of BBs. We employed spectral energy distribution fitting to derive homogeneous measurements of star-formation rates and stellar masses. Additionally, we measured emission-line fluxes, including $\rm HeII~\lambda 4686$, through spectral fitting. Through this work, we identified 48 BBs, of which 40 were first recognized as such, with the nearest at 19~Mpc. 14 of the BBs are in the south sky. The BBs tend to be extremely IR red in both WISE $W1-W2$ and $W2-W3$ colors, distinguishing them from typical SFGs. Dwarf SFGs with higher specific star-formation rates tend to have redder IR colors. Blueberry galaxies stand out as the most intensely star-forming sources in the local Universe among dwarf galaxies. They exhibit unique characteristics, such as being intrinsically bluer in visible light, redder in the infrared, and less massive. They also have higher specific star-formation rates, equivalent widths, lower metallicities, and the most strongly ionized interstellar medium compared to typical SFGs and GPs.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of magnetohydrodynamic modes in the ISM through synchrotron polarization statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in understanding Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the Synchrotron Polarization Analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfv\'en mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Pa$\alpha$-1.87 $\mu$m and Br$\alpha$-4.05 $\mu$m hydrogen recombination lines, as well as the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact HII regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at $\sim$10 pc scales in the associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). While HII regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact ($\sim$ 42%), extended ($\sim$ 34%) and open ($\sim$ 24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters ($&lt;$5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models that consider neutral and ionized PAH populations and analyses conducted at galactic scales. The 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m bands are typically associated to neutral and ionised PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity of the ionizing source, the constant PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity of the HII regions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cloud Matching in CO and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from Herschel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mu$m. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mu$m map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_\mathrm{CO}$ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}/(K\,km\,s^{-1})}$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: A Stacking Analysis Investigating the Evolution of Star Formation Rates and Stellar Masses in Groups and Clusters</title>

Abstract: The evolution of galaxies depends on their masses and local environments; understanding when and how environmental quenching starts to operate remains a challenge. Furthermore, studies of the high-redshift regime have been limited to massive cluster members, owing to sensitivity limits or small fields of views when the sensitivity is sufficient, intrinsically biasing the picture of cluster evolution. In this work, we use stacking to investigate the average star formation history of more than 10,000 groups and clusters drawn from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). Our analysis covers near ultraviolet to far infrared wavelengths, for galaxy overdensities at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.54$. We employ SED fitting to measure the specific star formation rates (sSFR) in four annular apertures with radii between 0 and 1000 kpc. At $z \gtrsim 1.6$, the average sSFR evolves similarly to the field in both the core and the cluster outskirts. Between $\overline{z} = 1.60$ and $\overline{z} = 1.35$, the sSFR in the core drops sharply, and continues to fall relative to the field sSFR at lower redshifts. We interpret this change as evidence that the impact of environmental quenching dramatically increases at $z \sim 1.5$, with the short time span of the transition suggesting that the environmental quenching mechanism dominant at this redshift operates on a rapid timescale. We find indications that the sSFR may decrease with increasing host halo mass, but lower-scatter mass tracers than the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are needed to confirm this relationship.</description>

      <title>Identification of Intermediate-mass Black Hole Candidates Among a Sample of Sd Galaxies</title>

Abstract: We analyzed images of every northern hemisphere Sd galaxy listed in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3) with a relatively face-on inclination ($\theta\leq30{\deg}$). Specifically, we measured the spiral arms' winding angle, $\phi$, in 85 galaxies. We applied a novel black hole mass planar scaling relation involving the rotational velocities (from the literature) and pitch angles of each galaxy to predict central black hole masses. This yielded 23 galaxies, each having at least a 50% chance of hosting a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), $10^2&lt;M_\mathrm{BH}\leq10^5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. These 23 nearby ($\lesssim$50 Mpc) targets may be suitable for an array of follow-up observations to check for active nuclei. Based on our full sample of 85 Sd galaxies, we estimate that the typical Sd galaxy (which tends to be bulgeless) harbors a black hole with $\log(M_\mathrm{BH}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=6.00\pm0.14$, but with a 27.7% chance of hosting an IMBH, making this morphological type of galaxy fertile ground for hunting elusive IMBHs. Thus, we find that a $\sim$$10^6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ black hole corresponds roughly to the onset of bulge development and serves as a conspicuous waypoint along the galaxy-SMBH coevolution journey. Our survey suggests that $&gt;$1.22% of bright galaxies ($B_{\rm T}\lesssim15.5$ mag) in the local Universe host an IMBH (i.e., the "occupation fraction"), which implies a number density $&gt;$$4.96\times10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for central IMBHs. Finally, we observe that Sd galaxies exhibit an unexpected diversity of properties that resemble the general population of spiral galaxies, albeit with an enhanced signature of the eponymous prototypical traits (i.e., low masses, loosely wound spiral arms, and smaller rotational velocities).</description>

      <title>Compressed baryon acoustic oscillation analysis is robust to modified-gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis to the underlying cosmological model. We focus on testing the standard BAO analysis that relies on the use of a template. These templates are constructed assuming a fixed fiducial cosmological model and used to extract the location of the acoustic peaks. Such "compressed analysis" had been shown to be unbiased when applied to the $\Lambda$CDM model and some of its extensions. However, it has not been known whether this type of analysis introduces biases in a wider range of cosmological models where the template may not fully capture relevant features in the BAO signal. In this study, we apply the compressed analysis to noiseless mock power spectra that are based on Horndeski models, a broad class of modified-gravity theories specified with eight additional free parameters. We study the precision and accuracy of the BAO peak-location extraction assuming DESI, DESI II, and MegaMapper survey specifications. We find that the bias in the extracted peak locations is negligible; for example, it is less than 10% of the statistical error for even the proposed future MegaMapper survey. Our findings indicate that the compressed BAO analysis is remarkably robust to the underlying cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>HI and CO spectroscopy of the unusual host of GRB 171205A: A grand design spiral galaxy with a distorted HI field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GRBs produced by the collapse of massive stars are usually found near the most prominent star-forming regions of star-forming galaxies. GRB 171205A happened in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy, a peculiar location in an atypical GRB host. In this paper we present a highly-resolved study of the molecular gas of this host, with CO(1-0) observations from ALMA. We compare with GMRT atomic HI observations, and with data at other wavelengths to provide a broad-band view of the galaxy. The ALMA observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 10 km/s, observed when the afterglow had a flux density of ~53 mJy. This allowed a molecular study both in emission and absorption. The HI observations allowed to study the host galaxy and its extended environment. The CO emission shows an undisturbed spiral structure with a central bar, and no significant emission at the location of the GRB. Our CO spectrum does not reveal any CO absorption, with a column density limit of &lt; 10^15 cm^-2. This argues against the progenitor forming in a massive molecular cloud. The molecular gas traces the galaxy arms with higher concentration in the regions dominated by dust. The HI gas does not follow the stellar light or the molecular gas and is concentrated in two blobs, with no emission towards the centre of the galaxy, and is slightly displaced towards the southwest of the galaxy, where the GRB exploded. Within the extended neighbourhood of the host galaxy, we identify another prominent HI source at the same redshift, at a projected distance of 188 kpc. Our observations show that the progenitor of this GRB is not associated to a massive molecular cloud, but more likely related to low-metallicity atomic gas. The distortion in the HI gas field is indicator of an odd environment that could have triggered star formation and could be linked to a past interaction with the companion galaxy.</description>
