      <description>arXiv:2502.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space $\mathcal{S}_{g, 2n}$ parametrizes pointed curves with spin structure. We prove that $\mathcal{S}_{g, 2}$, $\mathcal{S}_{g, 4}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{g, 6}$ are uniruled for particular values of $g$.</description>

      <title>Hyodo-Kato cohomology in rigid geometry: some foundational results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exploring the geometric properties of Hyodo-Kato cohomology in rigid geometry, we establish several foundational results, including the semistable conjecture for \'etale cohomology of almost proper rigid analytic varieties, and GAGA (comparison between algebraic and analytic) for Hyodo-Kato cohomology. A central component of our approach is the Gysin sequence for Hyodo-Kato cohomology, which we construct using the open-closed exact sequence for compactly supported Hyodo-Kato cohomology and Poincar\'e duality.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of de Rham complex for quasi-F-split varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the de Rham stack of Bhatt-Lurie and Drinfeld, we prove that de Rham complex of a smooth quasi-F-split variety over a perfect field of positive characteristic decomposes in all degrees. In particular, smooth proper quasi-F-split varieties have degenerate Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence, and satisfy Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano vanishing. We apply this to prove that the Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence for the classifying stack of a reductive group over a field of positive characteristic degenerates.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity of a Mori Dream Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the concept of multiplicity from fake weighted projective spaces, as introduced by Averkov, Kasprzyk, Lehmann and Nill in 2021, to Mori Dream Spaces, exploring interesting connections between the algebraic, geometric, and topological properties of these varieties. To this end, we introduce the weight group $G_Q$ and the weight modulus $|Q|$ of a complete toric variety. Their topological interpretation provides a framework for classifying Fano and $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano toric varieties, offering an alternative approach for a further understanding of this rich and fascinating area of algebraic geometry. In particular, we exhibit an algebraic interpretation of Batyrev's polar duality between Fano toric varieties as a direct sum decomposition of their common weight group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify when the blowup of a complex Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ along a smooth Schubert subvariety $Z$ is Fano. We compute almost all the two-point, genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of the blowup when $Z=G(k, n-1)$. We further prove a mirror symmetry statement for the blowup $X_{2, n}$
  of $G(2, n)$ along $G(2, n-1)$, by introducing a toric superpotential $f_{\rm tor}$ and showing the isomorphism between the Jacobi ring of $f_{\rm tor}$ and the small quantum cohomology ring $QH^*(X_{2, n})$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_K$ be an Abelian variety over the quotient field of a Dedekind domain $R$.
  We show that the identity component of the N\'eron model of $A_K$ acts regularly on any minimal model of $A_K$ over $R$, and discuss when the N\'eron model is an open subset of a minimal model.
  The main technical result is the rigidity of small modifications, leading to a regularity criterion for birational group actions.</description>

      <title>Weierstrass semigroups and automorphism group of a maximal function field with the third largest possible genus, $q \equiv 0 \pmod 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we complete the work started in arXiv:2303.00376v1 [math.AG] and arXiv:2404.18808v1 [math.AG], explicitly determining the Weierstrass semigroup at any place and the full automorphism group of a known $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-maximal function field $Z_3$ having the third largest genus, for $q \equiv 0 \pmod 3$. The cases $q \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ and $q \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ have been in fact analyzed in arXiv:2303.00376v1 [math.AG] and arXiv:2404.18808v1 [math.AG], respectively. As in the other two cases, the function field $Z_3$ arises as a Galois subfield of the Hermitian function field, and its uniqueness (with respect to the value of its genus) is a well-known open problem. Knowing the Weierstrass semigroups may provide a key towards solving this problem. Surprisingly enough, $Z_3$ has many different types of Weierstrass semigroups and the set of its Weierstrass places is much richer than its set of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational places. We show that a similar exceptional behaviour does not occur in terms of automorphisms, that is, $\mathrm{Aut}(Z_3)$ is exactly the automorphism group inherited from the Hermitian function field, apart from the case $q=3$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an elliptic avatar of loop spaces in derived algebraic geometry, completing the familiar trichotomoy of rational, trigonometric and elliptic objects. Heuristically, the elliptic loop space of $\mathcal{Y}$ is the stack of maps to $\mathcal{Y}$ from a certain exotic avatar $\mathcal{S}_{E}$ of the elliptic curve $E$, such that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $\mathcal{S}_{E}$ is the convolution category of zero-dimensionally supported coherent sheaves on $E$. For quotient stacks, the structure sheaf of the elliptic loop space gives rise to a theory of equivariant elliptic Hodge cohomology.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory. I. Component lattices of stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, a generalization of Donaldson-Thomas theory from the linear case, or the case of moduli stacks of objects in $3$-Calabi-Yau abelian categories, to the non-linear case of general $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This is done by developing a new framework for studying the enumerative geometry of general algebraic stacks, and we expect that this framework can also be applied to extending other types of enumerative theories for linear stacks to the non-linear case.
  In this paper, we establish the foundations of our framework. We introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack, which is the key combinatorial object in our theory. It generalizes and globalizes the cocharacter lattice and the Weyl group of an algebraic group, and is defined as the set of connected components of the stack of graded points of the original stack.
  We prove several results on the structure of graded and filtered points of a stack using the component lattice. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that there is a wall-and-chamber structure on the component lattice, such that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within each chamber. The second is the finiteness theorem, providing a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks, involving a notion of Hall categories.
  Finally, we discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</description>

      <title>Bruhat-Tits buildings and $p$-adic period domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a $p$-adic local field $F$. R\'emy-Thuillier-Werner constructed embeddings of the (reduced) Bruhat-Tits building $\mathcal{B}(G,F)$ into the Berkovich spaces associated to suitable flag varieties of $G$, generalizing the work of Berkovich in split case. They defined compactifications of $\mathcal{B}(G,F)$ by taking closure inside these Berkovich flag varieties. We show that, in the setting of a basic local Shimura datum, the R\'emy-Thuillier-Werner embedding factors through the associated $p$-adic Hodge-Tate period domain. Moreover, we compare the boundaries of the Berkovich compactification of $\mathcal{B}(G,F)$ with non basic Newton strata. In the case of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ and the cocharacter $\mu=(1^d, 0^{n-d})$ for an integer $d$ which is coprime to $n$, we further construct a continuous retraction map from the $p$-adic period domain to the building. This reveals new information on these $p$-adic period domains, which share many similarities with the Drinfeld spaces.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for the Algebraic Density Property of Affine $SL_2$-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ be an affine $k$-domain which admits a nontrivial fundamental pair $(D,U)$ of locally nilpotent derivations, i.e., if $E=[D,U]$ then $(D,U,E)$ is an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple. We prove an algebraic criterion, characterizing under which conditions the fundamental pair $(D,U)$ resp. the triple $(D,U,E)$ is compatible in a technical sense that allows us to construct many vector fields on the spectrum of $B$ from the complete ones. This criterion enables us to prove the algebraic density property for the following widely studied classes of $\mathrm{SL}_2$-varieties arising in physics: Classical Calogero--Moser spaces, Calogero--Moser spaces with "inner degrees of freedom'' and smooth cyclic quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Hodge numbers are not derived invariants in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a pair of Calabi-Yau threefolds X and M, fibered in non-principally polarized Abelian surfaces and their duals, and an equivalence D^b(X) = D^b(M), building on work of Gross, Popescu, Bak, and Schnell. Over the complex numbers, X is simply connected while pi_1(M) = (Z/3)^2. In characteristic 3, we find that X and M have different Hodge numbers, which would be impossible in characteristic 0.
  In an appendix, we give a streamlined proof of Abuaf's result that the ring H^*(O) is a derived invariant of complex threefolds and fourfolds.
  A second appendix by Alexander Petrov gives a family of higher-dimensional examples to show that h^{0,3} is not a derived invariant in any positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>KP integrability of triple Hodge integrals. III. Cut-and-join description, KdV reduction, and topological recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of the triple Hodge integrals satisfying the Calabi-Yau condition. For the tau-functions, which generate these integrals, we derive the complete families of the Heisenberg-Virasoro constraints. We also construct several equivalent versions of the cut-and-join operators. These operators describe the algebraic version of topological recursion. For the specific values of parameters associated with the KdV reduction, we prove that these tau-functions are equal to the generating functions of intersection numbers of $\psi$ and $\kappa$ classes. We interpret this relation as a symplectic invariance of the Chekhov--Eynard--Orantin topological recursion and prove this recursion for the general $\Theta$-case.</description>

      <title>Quasicoherent sheaves for dagger analytic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of quasicoherent sheaves on dagger analytic varieties based on Ind-Banach spaces. We show that they satisfy descent in the analytic topology. We define compactly supported pushforwards and produce an adjunction $f_! \dashv f^!$, and produce an excision sequence for certain inclusions of admissible open subsets. Finally, we prove a Grothendieck duality theorem.</description>

      <title>The Chow-Lam Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Chow form encodes any projective variety by one equation. We here introduce the Chow-Lam form for subvarieties of a Grassmannian. By evaluating the Chow-Lam form at twistor coordinates, we obtain universal projection formulas. These were pioneered by Thomas Lam for positroid varieties in the study of amplituhedra, and we develop his approach further. Universal formulas for branch loci are obtained from Hurwitz-Lam forms. Our focus is on computations and applications in geometry.</description>

      <title>Isotrivial elliptic surfaces in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relatively minimal surfaces equipped with a strongly isotrivial elliptic fibration in positive characteristic by means of the notion of equivariantly normal curves introduced and developed recently by Brion. Such surfaces are isomorphic to a contracted product $E\times^G X$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve, $G$ is a finite subgroup scheme of $E$ and $X$ is a $G$-normal curve. Using this description, we compute their Betti numbers to determine their birational classes. This allow us to complete the classification of maximal automorphism groups of surfaces in any characteristic. When $G$ is diagonalizable, we compute additional invariants to study the structure of their Picard schemes.</description>

      <title>Stability theory over toroidal or Novikov type base and Canonical modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one-parameter families in algebraic geometry and their use for stability theories ([GIT, HL, AHLH]) to families over toric varieties and their analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of ``irrational" direction in the literature as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Accordingly, we generalize the (semi)stable reduction-type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH] of Langton type to our higher rank setup. We also establish complex analytic analogue of the results. As an infinitesimal analogue of toric spectrum, we also use Novikov type rings as it gives more canonicity but its use can be avoided logically for readers for readers who prefer not to use such rings.
  As applications, we establish the properness part of the moduli of Calabi-Yau cones (cf., [Od24a]), and also reduce the properness of the moduli of Kahler-Ricci solitons, again to a finite generation type problem in birational geometry.</description>

      <title>Remarks on second and third weights of Projective Reed-Muller codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the weight distributions of the projective Reed-Muller codes is a very hard problem and has been studied extensively in the literature. In this article, we provide an alternative proof of the second weight of the projective Reed-Muller codes $\PRM (d, m)$ where $m \ge 3$ and $3 \le d \le \frac{q+3}{2}$. We show that the second weight is attained by codewords that correspond to hypersurfaces containing a hyperplane under the hypothesis on $d$. Furthermore, we compute the second weight of $\PRM (d, 2)$ for $3 \le d \le q-1$. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the third weight of $\PRM(d, 2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Positive and Invariant Tensor Decompositions: Applications to Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix rank and its positive versions are robust for small approximations, i.e. they do not decrease under small perturbations. In contrast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be a gap between rank and border rank, leading to instabilities in the optimization over sets with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite positive ranks also collapse for small perturbations? In this work, we prove that multipartite positive and invariant tensor decompositions exhibit gaps between rank and border rank, including tensor rank purifications and cyclic separable decompositions. We also prove a correspondence between positive decompositions and membership in certain sets of multipartite probability distributions, and leverage the gaps between rank and border rank to prove that these correlation sets are not closed. It follows that testing membership of probability distributions arising from resources like translational invariant Matrix Product States is impossible in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on the instability of ranks and the unique behavior of bipartite systems.</description>

Abstract: We define profinite formal manifolds and the profinite structure set of all profinite formal manifolds in a fixed profinite homotopy type. We prove that the Galois action of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on the underlying topological manifold structures of smooth, complete, simply-connected complex varieties defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ of dimension at least $3$ factors through the abelianization of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, this abelian action extends canonically to the whole profinite structure set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weil reciprocity law asserts that given two meromorphic functions $f, g$ on a compact complex curve, the product of the values of $f$ over the roots and poles of $g$ is equal to the product of the values of $g$ over the roots and poles of $f$. We state and prove a tropical version of this reciprocity; the tropical ideas lead to yet another transparent ``combinatorial'' proof of the classical Weil reciprocity law. Then, we construct a tropical Weil pairing on the set of divisors of degree zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider function spaces defined by self-attention networks without normalization, and theoretically analyze their geometry. Since these networks are polynomial, we rely on tools from algebraic geometry. In particular, we study the identifiability of deep attention by providing a description of the generic fibers of the parametrization for an arbitrary number of layers and, as a consequence, compute the dimension of the function space. Additionally, for a single-layer model, we characterize the singular and boundary points. Finally, we formulate a conjectural extension of our results to normalized self-attention networks, prove it for a single layer, and numerically verify it in the deep case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field with residue field $\bar K$ of dimension $1$ (not necessarily perfect). This occurs if and only if $K$ has dimension $2$. We prove the following statements on the arithmetic of such fields:
  - The "period equals index" property holds for central simple $K$-algebras.
  - For every prime $p$, every class in the Milnor $\mathrm{K}$-theory modulo $p$ is represented by a symbol.
  - Serre's Conjecture II holds for the field $K$. That is, for every semisimple and simply connected $K$-group $G$, the set $H^1(K,G)$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of representations of the modular group into $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a large four-dimensional family of representations of the modular group into $G_2$. Precisely, this family is an etale cover of degree $96$ of an open subset of the moduli space of such representations. This moduli space has two main components, of dimensions one and four. The one-dimensional component consists of well-studied rigid representations, in the sense of Katz. We focus on the four-dimensional component which consists of representations that are not rigid. We also provide algebraic conditions to ensure that the specializations surject onto $G_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ for primes $p\geq 5$. These representations give new examples of $\phi$-congruence subgroups of the modular group as introduced in previous work.</description>
