      <title>Double-magicity of proton drip-line nucleus $^{22}$Si with \textit{ab initio} calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New magic numbers have been discovered in the neutron-rich region of the nuclear chart. However, there has been a lack of research on proton-rich nuclei. $^{22}$O, the mirror nucleus of $^{22}$Si, is a double-magic nucleus bearing a high $E(2_1^+)$. Whether $^{22}$Si exhibits double-magic characters is an intriguing topic. To investigate this matter, we utilized \textit{ab initio} valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group for $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O, and their nearby nuclei. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations provide good descriptions for the double magicity of $^{22}$O, as well as the shell evolution of $N=14$ and $Z=14$ through $E(2_1^+)$. The computed $E(2_1^+)$ indicate that the closure of $Z=14$ sub-shell in proton-rich nuclei is weaker than the $N=14$ sub-shell closure in their mirror nuclei. Particularly, the calculated $E(2_1^+)$ of $^{22}$Si is 800 keV lower than the one of $^{22}$O. To further explore the magicity of $^{22}$Si, the mirror energy difference (MED) of $^{26}$Si/$^{26}$Mg, $^{24}$Si/$^{24}$Ne, as well as $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O are calculated. The results demonstrate that the calculated MEDs agree well with available experimental data, and the $E(2_1^+)$ values of $^{22,24,26}$Si are all lower than their respective mirror nuclei due to the Thomas-Ehrman shift with large $s_{1/2}$ occupation. Moreover, our calculation provides that the many-body configurations of the low-lying state of $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O are nearly identical despite the fact that the states bearing large MED. In conclusion, our \textit{ab initio} results suggest that $^{22}$Si is a double magic nucleus, similar to its mirror nucleus $^{22}$O, albeit with a lower $E(2_1^+)$.</description>

      <title>Universality of nucleon short-range behavior with chiral forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern advanced nuclear ab initio approaches with the similarity renormalization group (SRG) softened interactions miss high-momentum information, thus rendering them less suitable for characterizing nucleon-nucleon short-range physics. We introduce a novel framework to construct SRG-independent nuclear wave functions from No-Core Shell Model calculations. Applying our method to densities obtained with semilocal momentum-space-regularized chiral NN and NNN forces, we show key universalities of short-range behavior: (1) The two-body density ratio in the np S=1 channel, relative to the deuteron (d), is remarkably insensitive to interaction details. (2) More strikingly, while the ratio of total two-body densities to the deuteron exhibits cutoff dependence, the same ratio to the $\alpha$-particle (4-He) is almost independent of the interactions.</description>

      <title>The entangling power of non-entangling channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are processes that cannot generate entanglement but may, nevertheless, amplify entanglement already present in a system. Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of hot, dense nuclear matter plays a fundamental role in many areas. However, owing to the nonperturbative nature of strong interactions, a reliable treatment is still under debate. We use a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector\,$\otimes$\,vector contact interaction to study related issues at nonzero temperature or quark chemical potential, and carefully compare a noncovariant and a covariant regularization scheme. The numerical results show that the character of the phase transition depends sensitively on the regularization scheme and parameter choices.</description>

      <title>The domain of soft hadrons in transverse momentum space in high energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By studying experimental data for invariant transverse momentum distribution $f(p_{T})$ of hadrons in high energy $pp$, $p$A and AA collisions, we find two characteristic $p_{T}$ points relating to the behavior of $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$, i.e., the second derivative of the logarithm of hadronic $p_{T}$ spectrum with respect to $p_{T}$. One point is $p_{0}$ at which $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$ is zero and another point is $p_{1}$ at which $\left[\ln f(p_{T})\right]^{''}$ reaches maximum. \bz{The hadronic distribution can be classified into three kinetic regions, i.e., soft region $0&lt;p_{T}&lt;p_{0}$ dominated by hadrons from soft parton system, hard region $p_{T}&gt;p_{1}$ dominated by hadrons from high energy partonic jet, and the transition region $p_{0}&lt;p_{T}&lt;p_{1}$ of above two sources of hadron production.} Using rich data of hadronic $p_{T}$ spectra at RHIC and LHC, we carry out a systematical analysis for $p_{0}$ and $p_{1}$ of kaon, $K^{*}$, $\phi$ and baryons such as $p$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ in $pp$, $p$-Pb and heavy-ion collisions, and show their dependence on hadron species, collision energy, collision centrality and/or charged-particle multiplicity. We also study the correlation between $p_{0}$ of hadrons and their average transverse momentum $\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $, and find a difference between $p_{0}$-$\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $ correlation of baryons and that of mesons which can be understood by quark combination mechanism at hadronization. The systematic comparison for $p_{0}$-$\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle $ correlation of kaon, $\phi$, $p$ and $\Lambda$ in $pp$, $p$-Pb, Pb-Pb and Au+Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies indicates that $p_{0}$ is a sensitive physical quantity of reflecting the production property of soft hadrons in high energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Statistical repulsion on hyperons in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of hyperons in baryonic (diquark) matter in two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) by introducing heavy quark doublets that emulate strange quarks. An even number of flavors is required to avoid the sign problem in lattice Monte Carlo simulations. To explore QC$_2$D matter containing both light and heavy quarks, we construct a model in which quarks interact with light-light, light-heavy (hyperonic), and heavy-heavy diquarks via Yukawa couplings. As the quark chemical potential increases, the light diquarks condense first and form baryonic matter, and this onset density can be understood in hadronic terms. In contrast, the onset density of hyperons is substantially higher than that estimated from the hadronic sector of the model. This shift reflects an effective repulsion among baryons induced by the pre-occupied light quarks. The Pauli blocking of light quarks suppresses the attractive diquark correlations responsible, in vacuum, for making hyperons lighter than the sum of the constituent light and heavy quark masses. Implications for three-color QCD are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in mass-8 proton-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in A=8 nuclei has been demonstrated. Two of these are the ground state of 8C and its isobaric analog state in 8B, both of which are analogs of the halo or thick-skinned nucleus 8He. The third member is the recently found fourth 1+ state in 8B. This new 8B state at E*=8.4 MeV was observed to decay to the ground state of 6Li by 2p emission. Momentum correlations between the decay products indicate that it is not a sequential 2p decay through a 7Be intermediate state, but indicative of prompt 2p emission with correlations similar to those of the other members of the triplet. Ab initio calculations with the symmetry-adapted nocore shell model indicate that these three states have very similar spatial wavefunctions, but with nucleons coupling to different spins, isospins, and isospin projections. The triplet of 2p emitters all have oblate shapes and by stripping two protons equatorially, decay to states which have prolate shapes.</description>

Abstract: Shell-model calculations with density-dependent interactions are performed to investigate $pf$-shell nuclei, examining the ground-state energies, low-lying spectra, and $E2$ transition probabilities. The density-dependent terms in the interaction are self-consistently determined using the shell-model wave function for the ground state. We test three density-dependent interactions adapted from density functionals of Gogny-D1S, Gogny-GT2, and M3Y-P6. The shell-model results satisfactorily agree with the experimental data. However, the Gogny-D1S and Gogny-GT2 fail to reproduce the magicity of $N=28$, while it is properly described by the M3Y-P6 functional.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Lense-Thirring Orbital Precession and the Neutron Star Moment of Inertia with Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Going beyond these (to date theory-specific) insights, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution that holds in any quantum field theory with any coupling strength. This condition, which is the generalization of the Einstein relation to quantum field theories which feature non-Gaussian fluctuations, reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism. We employ an effective Lagrangian to model the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons and apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels, incorporating the effect of the Coulomb interaction when the pair involves two charged particles. The resulting full coupled-channel wave function is inserted into the Koonin-Pratt equation with channel weights derived from a thermal model. Additionally, we compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation with low-energy scattering parameters extracted from the unitarized amplitudes. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs. Our results can be tested against current and future experimental data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>
