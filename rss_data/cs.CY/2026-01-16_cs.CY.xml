Abstract: This paper discusses legal developments in Europe and the Netherlands. Recent decisions show that European data protection law, or privacy law, applies to behavioral targeting in most cases. Dutch law explicitly presumes that data protection law applies to behavioral targeting. This means that companies have to comply with data protection law's fair information principles. For example, companies must refrain from secret or excessive data collection. Perhaps the principles could provide inspiration for future W3C projects. Could technology design foster fair information processing?</description>

      <title>Behavioral Targeting, a European Legal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral targeting, or online profiling, is a hotly debated topic. Much of the collection of personal information on the Internet is related to behavioral targeting, although research suggests that most people don't want to receive behaviorally targeted advertising. The World Wide Web Consortium is discussing a Do Not Track standard, and regulators worldwide are struggling to come up with answers. This article discusses European law and recent policy developments on behavioral targeting.</description>

      <title>Filtering for Copyright Enforcement in Europe after the Sabam cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sabam, a Belgian collective rights management organisation, wanted an internet access provider and a social network site to install a filter system to enforce copyrights. In two recent judgments, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that the social network site and the internet access provider cannot be required to install the filter system that Sabam asked for. Are these judgments good news for fundamental rights? This article argues that little is won for privacy and freedom of information.</description>

      <title>Critically Engaged Pragmatism: A Scientific Norm and Social, Pragmatist Epistemology for AI Science Evaluation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crises in peer review capacity, study replication, and AI-fabricated science have intensified interest in automated tools for assessing scientific research. However, the scientific community has a history of decontextualizing and repurposing credibility markers in inapt ways. I caution that AI science evaluation tools are particularly prone to these kinds of inference by false ascent due to contestation about the purposes to which they should be put, their portability across purposes, and technical demands that prioritize data set size over epistemic fit. To counter this, I argue for a social, pragmatist epistemology and a newly articulated norm of Critically Engaged Pragmatism to enjoin scientific communities to vigorously scrutinize the purposes and purpose-specific reliability of AI science evaluation tools. Under this framework, AI science evaluation tools are not objective arbiters of scientific credibility, but the object of the kinds of critical discursive practices that ground the credibility of scientific communities.</description>

      <title>Democracy and Distrust in an Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay examines how judicial review should adapt to address challenges posed by artificial intelligence decision-making, particularly regarding minority rights and interests. As I argue in this essay, the rise of three trends-privatization, prediction, and automation in AI-have combined to pose similar risks to minorities. Here, I outline what a theory of judicial review would look like in an era of artificial intelligence, analyzing both the limitations and the possibilities of judicial review of AI. I draw on cases in which AI decision-making has been challenged in courts, to show how concepts of due process and equal protection can be recuperated in a modern AI era, and even integrated into AI, to provide for better oversight and accountability, offering a framework for judicial review in the AI era that protects minorities from algorithmic discrimination.</description>

      <title>Strategies of cooperation and defection in five large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to support human decision-making. This use of LLMs has concerning implications, especially when their prescriptions affect the welfare of others. To gauge how LLMs make social decisions, we explore whether five leading models produce sensible strategies in the repeated prisoner's dilemma, which is the main metaphor of reciprocal cooperation. First, we measure the propensity of LLMs to cooperate in a neutral setting, without using language reminiscent of how this game is usually presented. We record to what extent LLMs implement Nash equilibria or other well-known strategy classes. Thereafter, we explore how LLMs adapt their strategies to changes in parameter values. We vary the game's continuation probability, the payoff values, and whether the total number of rounds is commonly known. We also study the effect of different framings. In each case, we test whether the adaptations of the LLMs are in line with basic intuition, theoretical predictions of evolutionary game theory, and experimental evidence from human participants. While all LLMs perform well in many of the tasks, none of them exhibit full consistency over all tasks. We also conduct tournaments between the inferred LLM strategies and study direct interaction between LLMs in games over ten rounds with a known or unknown last round. Our experiments shed light on how current LLMs instantiate reciprocal cooperation.</description>

      <title>Modeling conflicting incentives in engineering senior capstone projects: A multi-player game theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: University engineering capstone projects involve sustained interaction among students, faculty, and industry sponsors whose objectives are only partially aligned. While capstones are widely used in engineering education, existing analyses typically treat stakeholder behavior informally or descriptively, leaving incentive conflicts, information asymmetries, and strategic dependencies underexplored. This paper develops a formal game-theoretic framework that models capstone projects as a sequential Bayesian game involving three players: the university, the industry sponsor, and the student team. The framework is intended as an analytical and explanatory tool for understanding how institutional policy choices, such as grading structures, intellectual property rules, and sponsor engagement expectations, shape stakeholder behavior and project outcomes, rather than as a calibrated or predictive model. The university acts as a constrained Stackelberg leader by committing to course policies and assessment structures while anticipating strategic responses by sponsors and students under incomplete information. Reduced-form outcome functions capture technical quality, documentation quality, timeliness, alignment with sponsor needs, and publishability, while payoff functions reflect stakeholder-specific objectives and costs. Under standard assumptions, the model admits stable equilibrium regimes that correspond to empirically recognizable capstone dynamics observed in practice, including cooperative engagement, sponsor-dominated exploitation, and student grade gaming. Rather than claiming precise prediction, the framework provides a structured basis for reasoning about incentive design, policy tradeoffs, and structural failure modes in project-based learning environments, as well as for future extensions incorporating richer dynamics, repeated interaction, and empirical calibration.</description>

      <title>Brief but Impactful: How Human Tutoring Interactions Shape Engagement in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning analytics can guide human tutors to efficiently address motivational barriers to learning that AI systems struggle to support. Students become more engaged when they receive human attention. However, what occurs during short interventions, and when are they most effective? We align student-tutor dialogue transcripts with MATHia tutoring system log data to study brief human-tutor interactions on Zoom drawn from 2,075 hours of 191 middle school students' classroom math practice. Mixed-effect models reveal that engagement, measured as successful solution steps per minute, is higher during a human-tutor visit and remains elevated afterward. Visit length exhibits diminishing returns: engagement rises during and shortly after visits, irrespective of visit length. Timing also matters: later visits yield larger immediate lifts than earlier ones, though an early visit remains important to counteract engagement decline. We create analytics that identify which tutor-student dialogues raise engagement the most. Qualitative analysis reveals that interactions with concrete, stepwise scaffolding with explicit work organization elevate engagement most strongly. We discuss implications for resource-constrained tutoring, prioritizing several brief, well-timed check-ins by a human tutor while ensuring at least one early contact. Our analytics can guide the prioritization of students for support and surface effective tutor moves in real-time.</description>

      <title>STEAMROLLER: A Multi-Agent System for Inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition for People who Stutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People who stutter (PWS) face systemic exclusion in today's voice-driven society, where access to voice assistants, authentication systems, and remote work tools increasingly depends on fluent speech. Current automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, trained predominantly on fluent speech, fail to serve millions of PWS worldwide. We present STEAMROLLER, a real time system that transforms stuttered speech into fluent output through a novel multi-stage, multi-agent AI pipeline. Our approach addresses three critical technical challenges: (1) the difficulty of direct speech to speech conversion for disfluent input, (2) semantic distortions introduced during ASR transcription of stuttered speech, and (3) latency constraints for real time communication. STEAMROLLER employs a three stage architecture comprising ASR transcription, multi-agent text repair, and speech synthesis, where our core innovation lies in a collaborative multi-agent framework that iteratively refines transcripts while preserving semantic intent. Experiments on the FluencyBank dataset and a user study demonstrates clear word error rate (WER) reduction and strong user satisfaction. Beyond immediate accessibility benefits, fine tuning ASR on STEAMROLLER repaired speech further yields additional WER improvements, creating a pathway toward inclusive AI ecosystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we move towards more ubiquitous computing, the concept of pervasive augmented reality (PAR) could lead to a major evolution in the relationship between humans, computing and the world. The experience of a continuously augmented world can have both benefits and undesirable consequences for users' lives, and raises many questions in multiple areas. In this workshop, we wanted to bring together all IHM'25 conference participants who are concerned or enthusiastic about discussing this topic. The aim was to draw on collective intelligence to identify the interdisciplinary challenges that remain to be resolved in order to enable the implementation of these technologies in everyday life, but also to define the necessary safeguards. Is PAR too techno-enthusiastic? All of these elements were grouped into categories to define a set of future major areas of research around permanent augmented reality. This document is in French as the conference is a French-speaking international conference.</description>

      <title>Job Anxiety in Post-Secondary Computer Science Students Caused by Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging widespread usage of AI has led to industry adoption to improve efficiency and increase earnings. However, a major consequence of this is AI displacing employees from their jobs, leading to feelings of job insecurity and uncertainty. This is especially true for computer science students preparing to enter the workforce. To investigate this, we performed semi-structured interviews with (n = 25) students across computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Toronto to determine the extent of job replacement anxiety. Through thematic analysis, it was determined that computer science students indeed face stress and anxiety from AI displacement of jobs, leading to different strategies of managing pressure. Subfields such as software engineering and web development are strongly believed to be vulnerable to displacement, while specialized subfields like quantum computing and AI research are deemed more secure. Many students feel compelled to upskill by using more AI technologies, taking AI courses, and specializing in AI through graduate school. Some students also reskill by pursuing other fields of study seen as less vulnerable to AI displacement. Finally, international students experience additional job replacement anxiety because of pressure to secure permanent residence. Implications of these findings include feelings of low security in computer science careers, oversaturation of computer science students pursuing AI, and potential dissuasion of future university students from pursuing computer science.</description>

      <title>Institutional AI: A Governance Framework for Distributional AGI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLM-based systems increasingly operate as agents embedded within human social and technical systems, alignment can no longer be treated as a property of an isolated model, but must be understood in relation to the environments in which these agents act. Even the most sophisticated methods of alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RHLF) or through AI Feedback (RLAIF) cannot ensure control once internal goal structures diverge from developer intent. We identify three structural problems that emerge from core properties of AI models: (1) behavioral goal-independence, where models develop internal objectives and misgeneralize goals; (2) instrumental override of natural-language constraints, where models regard safety principles as non-binding while pursuing latent objectives, leveraging deception and manipulation; and (3) agentic alignment drift, where individually aligned agents converge to collusive equilibria through interaction dynamics invisible to single-agent audits. The solution this paper advances is Institutional AI: a system-level approach that treats alignment as a question of effective governance of AI agent collectives. We argue for a governance-graph that details how to constrain agents via runtime monitoring, incentive shaping through prizes and sanctions, explicit norms and enforcement roles. This institutional turn reframes safety from software engineering to a mechanism design problem, where the primary goal of alignment is shifting the payoff landscape of AI agent collectives.</description>

      <title>The Conversational Exam: A Scalable Assessment Design for the AI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional assessment methods collapse when students use generative AI to complete work without genuine engagement, creating an illusion of competence where they believe they're learning but aren't. This paper presents the conversational exam -- a scalable oral examination format that restores assessment validity by having students code live while explaining their reasoning. Drawing on human-computer interaction principles, we examined 58 students in small groups across just two days, demonstrating that oral exams can scale to typical class sizes. The format combines authentic practice (students work with documentation and supervised AI access) with inherent validity (real-time performance cannot be faked). We provide detailed implementation guidance to help instructors adapt this approach, offering a practical path forward when many educators feel paralyzed between banning AI entirely or accepting that valid assessment is impossible.</description>

      <title>Social Determinants of Health Prediction for ICD-9 Code with Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.</description>

Abstract: The need and theoretical methods for measuring and reducing CO2 emitted by computing systems are well understood, but real-world examples are still limited. We describe a journey towards green software for a live product running on a public cloud. We discuss practical solutions found, in particular using the cost implications of serverless systems to drive efficiency. We end with some `green software' principles that worked well in this project.</description>

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.</description>

      <title>AmbShield: Enhancing Physical Layer Security with Ambient Backscatter Devices against Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive eavesdropping compromises confidentiality in wireless networks, especially in resource-constrained environments where heavyweight cryptography is impractical. Physical layer security (PLS) exploits channel randomness and spatial selectivity to confine information to an intended receiver with modest overhead. However, typical PLS techniques, such as using beamforming, artificial noise, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, often involve added active power or specialized deployment, and, in many designs, rely on precise time synchronization and perfect CSI estimation, which limits their practicality. To this end, we propose AmbShield, an AmBD-assisted PLS scheme that leverages naturally distributed AmBDs to simultaneously strengthen the legitimate channel and degrade eavesdroppers' without requiring extra transmit power and with minimal deployment overhead. In AmbShield, AmBDs are exploited as friendly jammers that randomly backscatter to create interference at eavesdroppers, and as passive relays that backscatter the desired signal to enhance the capacity of legitimate devices. We further develop a unified analytical framework that analyzes the exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of legitimate and eavesdropper signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and a closed-form secrecy outage probability (SOP). The analysis provides clear design guidelines on various practical system parameters to minimize SOP. Extensive experiments that include Monte Carlo simulations, theoretical derivations, and high-SNR asymptotic analysis demonstrate the security gains of AmbShield across diverse system parameters under imperfect synchronization and CSI estimation.</description>

      <title>How Diplomacy Reshapes Online Discourse:Asymmetric Persistence in Online Framing of North Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public opinion toward foreign adversaries shapes and constrains diplomatic options. Prior research has largely relied on sentiment analysis and survey based measures, providing limited insight into how sustained narrative changes (beyond transient emotional reactions) might follow diplomatic engagement. This study examines the extent to which high stakes diplomatic summits shape how adversaries are framed in online discourse. We analyze U.S.-North Korea summit diplomacy (2018-2019) using a Difference-in-Difference(DiD) design on Reddit discussions. Using multiple control groups (China, Iran, Russia) to adjust for concurrent geopolitical shocks, we integrate a validated Codebook LLM framework for framing classification with graph based discourse network analysis that examines both edge level relationships and community level narrative structures. Our results reveal short term asymmetric persistence in framing responses to diplomacy. While both post level and comment level sentiment proved transient (improving during the Singapore Summit but fully reverting after the Hanoi failure),framing exhibited significant stability: the shift from threat oriented to diplomacy oriented framing was only partially reversed. Structurally, the proportion of threat oriented edges decreased substantially (48% -&gt; 28%) while diplomacy oriented structures expanded, and these shifts resisted complete reversion after diplomatic failure. These findings suggest that diplomatic success can leave a short-term but lasting imprint on how adversaries are framed in online discourse, even when subsequent negotiations fail.</description>

      <title>Contextual StereoSet: Stress-Testing Bias Alignment Robustness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p&lt;0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.</description>

      <title>Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation with Vision-Language Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.</description>

      <title>Breaking Up with Normatively Monolithic Agency with GRACE: A Reason-Based Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Safe and Ethical AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.</description>

      <title>Generative AI collective behavior needs an interactionist paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.</description>

      <title>Transforming Crises into Opportunities: From Chaos to Urban Antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban crises - floods, pandemics, economic shocks, and conflicts - function as accelerators of urban change, exposing structural vulnerabilities while creating windows for reinvention. Building on a prior theoretical contribution that identified fifteen principles of urban antifragility, this paper tests and operationalizes the framework through an empirical assessment of 26 cities selected for their post-crisis adaptation trajectories. Using a tailored diagnostic methodology, we benchmark cities' Stress Response Strategies (SRS) and then evaluate Urban Development Trajectories (UDT) across four weighted dimensions, positioning each case along a fragility-robustness-resilience-antifragility continuum and applying a balanced-threshold rule to confirm antifragile status. Results show that "resilience enhanced by innovation and technology" is the most effective response typology (86.9/100), and that six cities meet the antifragile trajectory criteria. By mapping best practices to activated principles and analysing co-activations, the study identifies a robust "hard core" of principles - Sustainable Resilience (O), Strategic Diversity (F), Proactive Innovation (I), and Active Prevention (N) - supplemented by operational enablers (e.g., anticipation, mobilization, shock absorption). The paper concludes by proposing an evidence-based, SDG-aligned operational model that links high-impact principle pairings to measurable indicators, offering a practical roadmap for cities seeking to convert crises into sustained transformation. Keywords: Post-crisis strategies, Urban antifragility, Sustainable cities and communities, Disaster resilience and urban regeneration, Risk governance and Black Swan adaptation.</description>

      <title>When Should a Principal Delegate to an Agent in Selection Processes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-makers in high-stakes selection processes often face a fundamental choice: whether to make decisions themselves or to delegate authority to another entity whose incentives may only be partially aligned with their own. Such delegation arises naturally in settings like graduate admissions, hiring, or promotion, where a principal (e.g. a professor or worker) either reviews applicants personally or decisions are delegated to an agent (e.g. a committee or boss) that evaluates applicants efficiently, but according to a potentially misaligned objective.
  We study this trade-off in a stylized selection model with noisy signals. The principal incurs a cost for selecting applicants, but can evaluate applicants based on their fit with a project, team, workplace, etc. In contrast, the agent evaluates applicants solely on the basis of a signal that correlates with the principal's metric, but this comes at no cost to the principal. Our goal is to characterize when delegation is beneficial versus when decision-making should remain with the principal. We compare these regimes along three dimensions: (i) the principal's utility, (ii) the quality of the selected applicants according to the principal's metric, and (iii) the fairness of selection outcomes under disparate signal qualities.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Purpose-built for Social and Mental Health: A Real-World Pilot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots built for mental health could deliver safe, personalized, and scalable mental health support. We evaluate a foundation model designed for mental health. Adults completed mental health measures while engaging with the chatbot between May 15, 2025 and September 15, 2025. Users completed an opt-in consent, demographic information, mental health symptoms, social connection, and self-identified goals. Measures were repeated every two weeks up to 6 weeks, and a final follow-up at 10 weeks. Analyses included effect sizes, and growth mixture models to identify participant groups and their characteristic engagement, severity, and demographic factors. Users demonstrated significant reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 that were sustained at follow-up. Significant improvements in Hope, Behavioral Activation, Social Interaction, Loneliness, and Perceived Social Support were observed throughout and maintained at 10 week follow-up. Engagement was high and predicted outcomes. Working alliance was comparable to traditional care and predicted outcomes. Automated safety guardrails functioned as designed, with 76 sessions flagged for risk and all handled according to escalation policies. This single arm naturalistic observational study provides initial evidence that a GAI foundation model for mental health can deliver accessible, engaging, effective, and safe mental health support. These results lend support to findings from early randomized designs and offer promise for future study of mental health GAI in real world settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Impacts of Traffic Regulations in Complex Mobility Systems Using Scenario-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban traffic regulation policies are increasingly used to address congestion, emissions, and accessibility in cities, yet their impacts are difficult to assess due to the socio-technical complexity of urban mobility systems. Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of mobility flows and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current as-is scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple what-if scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study that aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Fails to Remove Data Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning. In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of poisoned data. We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of settings, they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning. Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, are required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees. Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned data without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet ``ready for prime time,'' and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Fair and Reliable Organ Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical institutions are considering the use of LLMs in high-stakes clinical decision-making, such as organ allocation. In such sensitive use cases, evaluating fairness is imperative. However, existing evaluation methods often fall short; benchmarks are too simplistic to capture real-world complexity, and accuracy-based metrics fail to address the absence of a clear ground truth. To realistically and fairly model organ allocation, specifically kidney allocation, we begin by testing the medical knowledge of LLMs to determine whether they understand the clinical factors required to make sound allocation decisions. Building on this foundation, we design two tasks: (1) Choose-One and (2) Rank-All. In Choose-One, LLMs select a single candidate from a list of potential candidates to receive a kidney. In this scenario, we assess fairness across demographics using traditional fairness metrics, such as proportional parity. In Rank-All, LLMs rank all candidates waiting for a kidney, reflecting real-world allocation processes more closely, where an organ is passed down a ranked list until allocated. Our evaluation on three LLMs reveals a divergence between fairness metrics: while exposure-based metrics suggest equitable outcomes, probability-based metrics uncover systematic preferential sorting, where specific groups were clustered in upper-ranking tiers. Furthermore, we observe that demographic preferences are highly task-dependent, showing inverted trends between Choose-One and Rank-All tasks, even when considering the topmost rank. Overall, our results indicate that current LLMs can introduce inequalities in real-world allocation scenarios, underscoring the urgent need for rigorous fairness evaluation and human oversight before their use in high-stakes decision-making.</description>

      <title>Textual Entailment is not a Better Bias Metric than Token Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized for their distance from real-world language model use cases and harms. In this work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as an alternative bias metric. In extensive experiments across seven LM families, we show that NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. NLI metrics are more brittle and unstable, slightly less sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences, and slightly more sensitive to wording of tested stereotypes than TP approaches. Given this conflicting evidence, we conclude that neither token probability nor natural language inference is a ``better'' bias metric in all cases. We do not find sufficient evidence to justify NLI as a complete replacement for TP metrics in bias evaluation.</description>
