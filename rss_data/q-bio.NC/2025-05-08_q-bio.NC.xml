      <title>Depolarization block induction via slow NaV1.1 inactivation in Dravet syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by the early onset of drug-resistant seizures and various comorbidities. Most cases of this severe and complex pathology are due to mutations of NaV1.1, a sodium channel mainly expressed in fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Layer et al. (Front. Cell. Neurosci. 15, 2021) showed that one of these mutations alters the voltage dependence of channel activation, as well as the voltage dependence and kinetics of slow inactivation. Implementing the three effects into a computational model, they predict that altered activation has the largest impact on channel function, as it causes the most severe firing rate reduction. Using a conductance-based model tailored to the dynamics of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons, we look deeper into slow inactivation. We exploit the timescale difference between this very slow process and the rest of the system to conduct a multiple-timescale analysis. We find that, upon prolonged stimulation, the onset of slow inactivation at lower voltage in mutant channels promotes depolarization block, another possible firing deficit aside from frequency reduction. The accelerated kinetics of slow inactivation in mutant channels hastens this transition. This suggests that slow inactivation alterations might for some Dravet variant contribute to the pathological mechanism.</description>

      <title>Neural Representational Consistency Emerges from Probabilistic Neural-Behavioral Representation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual brains exhibit striking structural and physiological heterogeneity, yet neural circuits can generate remarkably consistent functional properties across individuals, an apparent paradox in neuroscience. While recent studies have observed preserved neural representations in motor cortex through manual alignment across subjects, the zero-shot validation of such preservation and its generalization to more cortices remain unexplored. Here we present PNBA (Probabilistic Neural-Behavioral Representation Alignment), a new framework that leverages probabilistic modeling to address hierarchical variability across trials, sessions, and subjects, with generative constraints preventing representation degeneration. By establishing reliable cross-modal representational alignment, PNBA reveals robust preserved neural representations in monkey primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) through zero-shot validation. We further establish similar representational preservation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), reflecting a general neural basis. These findings resolve the paradox of neural heterogeneity by establishing zero-shot preserved neural representations across cortices and species, enriching neural coding insights and enabling zero-shot behavior decoding.</description>

      <title>The role of gap junctions and clustered connectivity in emergent synchronisation patterns of inhibitory neuronal networks</title>

Abstract: Inhibitory interneurons, ubiquitous in the central nervous system, form networks connected through both chemical synapses and gap junctions. These networks are essential for regulating the activity of principal neurons, especially by inducing temporally patterned dynamic states. We aim to understand the dynamic mechanisms for synchronisation in networks of electrically and chemically coupled interneurons. We use the exact mean-field reduction to derive a neural mass model for both homogeneous and clustered networks. We first analyse a single population of neurons to understand how the two couplings interact with one another. We demonstrate that the network transitions from an asynchronous to a synchronous regime either by increasing the strength of the gap junction connectivity or the strength of the background input current. Conversely, the strength of inhibitory synapses affects the population firing rate, suggesting that electrical and chemical coupling strengths act as complementary mechanisms by which networks can tune synchronous oscillatory behavior. In line with previous work, we confirm that the depolarizing spikelet is crucial for the emergence of synchrony. Furthermore, find that the fast frequency component of the spikelet ensures robustness to heterogeneity. Next, inspired by the existence of multiple interconnected interneuron subtypes in the cerebellum, we analyse networks consisting of two clusters of cell types defined by differing chemical versus electrical coupling strengths. We show that breaking the electrical and chemical coupling symmetry between these clusters induces bistability, so that a transient external input can switch the network between synchronous and asynchronous firing. Together, our results shows the variety of cell-intrinsic and network properties that contribute to synchronisation of interneuronal networks with multiple types of coupling.</description>

      <title>Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</title>

Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.</description>
