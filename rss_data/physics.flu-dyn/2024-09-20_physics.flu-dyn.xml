      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplication. At the moment, the main interface of software libraries for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs allowed to conclude that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the naive implementations by several times. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a naive optimized implementation.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspension Inertial Microfluidic Particle Theory (DENSE-IMPACT) Model for Elucidating Outer Wall Focusing at High Cell Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial microfluidics have been limited to dilute particle concentrations due to defocusing at high particle concentrations. However, we observed a counterintuitive shift of focusing to the outer wall at high concentrations, which contradicts the existing particle focusing theory based on Navier-Stokes equation. We developed a multiphase model incorporating lift forces and particle-particle interactions to explain this behaviour. Numerical simulations validated by experimental data reveal the shift is governed by the ratio of the lift force strength to that of particle interaction frequencies.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for fully coupled stochastic fluid dynamics across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates variational frameworks for modeling stochastic dynamics in incompressible fluids, focusing on large-scale fluid behavior alongside small-scale stochastic processes. The authors aim to develop a coupled system of equations that captures both scales, using a variational principle formulated with Lagrangians defined on the full flow, and incorporating stochastic transport constraints. The approach smooths the noise term along time, leading to stochastic dynamics as a regularization parameter approaches zero. Initially, fixed noise terms are considered, resulting in a generalized stochastic Euler equation, which becomes problematic as the regularization parameter diminishes. The study then examines connections with existing stochastic frameworks and proposes a new variational principle that couples noise dynamics with large-scale fluid motion. This comprehensive framework provides a stochastic representation of large-scale dynamics while accounting for fine-scale components. The evolution of the small-scale velocity component is governed by a linear Euler equation with random coefficients, influenced by large-scale transport, stretching, and pressure forcing.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-based multipoint optimization of fluidic injection parameters for improving nozzle performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluidic injection provides a promising solution to improve the performance of overexpanded single expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) during vehicle acceleration. However, determining the injection parameters for the best overall performance under multiple nozzle operating conditions is still a challenge. The gradient-based optimization method requires gradients of injection parameters at each design point, leading to high computational costs if traditional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are adopted. This paper uses a pretrained neural network model to replace CFD during optimization to quickly calculate the nozzle flow field at multiple design points. Considering the physical characteristics of the nozzle flow field, a prior-based prediction strategy is adopted to enhance the model's transferability. In addition, the back-propagation algorithm of the neural network is adopted to quickly evaluate the gradients by calling the computation process only once, thereby greatly reducing the gradient computation time compared to the finite differential method. As a test case, the average nozzle thrust coefficient of a SERN at seven design points is optimized. An improvement in the thrust coefficient of 1.14% is achieved, and the time cost is greatly reduced compared with the traditional optimization methods, even when the time to establish the database for training is considered.</description>

      <title>Rapid aerodynamic prediction of swept wings via physics-embedded transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based models provide a promising way to rapidly acquire transonic swept wing flow fields but suffer from large computational costs in establishing training datasets. Here, we propose a physics-embedded transfer learning framework to efficiently train the model by leveraging the idea that a three-dimensional flow field around wings can be analyzed with two-dimensional flow fields around cross-sectional airfoils. An airfoil aerodynamics prediction model is pretrained with airfoil samples. Then, an airfoil-to-wing transfer model is fine-tuned with a few wing samples to predict three-dimensional flow fields based on two-dimensional results on each spanwise cross section. Sweep theory is embedded when determining the corresponding airfoil geometry and operating conditions, and to obtain the sectional airfoil lift coefficient, which is one of the operating conditions, the low-fidelity vortex lattice method and data-driven methods are proposed and evaluated. Compared to a nontransfer model, introducing the pretrained model reduces the error by 30%, while introducing sweep theory further reduces the error by 9%. When reducing the dataset size, less than half of the wing training samples are need to reach the same error level as the nontransfer framework, which makes establishing the model much easier.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Wavevector Model for Rapidly-Distorted Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic wavevector approach is formulated to accurately represent compressible turbulence subject to rapid deformations. This approach is inspired by the incompressible particle representation model of Kassinos (1995) and preserves the exact nature of compressible Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT). The adoption of a stochastic - rather than the Fourier - perspective simplifies the transformation of statistics to physical space and serves as a starting point for the development of practical turbulence models. We assume small density fluctuations and isentropic flow to obtain a transport equation for the pressure fluctuation. This results in five fewer transport equations compared to the compressible RDT model of Yu and Girimaji (2007). The final formulation is closed in spectral space and only requires numerical approximation for the transformation integrals. The use of Monte Carlo for unit wavevector integration motivates the representation of the moments as stochastic variables. Consistency between the Fourier and stochastic representation is demonstrated by showing equivalency between the evolution equations for the velocity spectrum tensor in both representations. Sample clustering with respect to orientation allows for different techniques to be used for the wavevector magnitude integration. The performance of the stochastic model is evaluated for axially-compressed turbulence, serving as a simplified model for shock-turbulence interaction, and is compared to LIA and DNS. Pure and compressed sheared turbulence at different distortion Mach numbers are also computed and compared to RDT/DNS data. Finally, two additional deformations are applied and compared to solenoidal and pressure-released limits to demonstrate the modeling capability for generic rapid deformations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of fluid flow in fractal microfluidic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal channels have significant applications in fields such as microfluidic chips and in vitro diagnostics. However, there is currently insufficient understanding and recognition of fluid flow within fractal channels. In this paper, the fluid flow within dendritic fractal structures was studied with finite element analysis (FEA), focusing on fluid velocity and mass fraction variations. The research introduces the ratio RA (the ratio of the longitudinal channel length to the lateral channel length) as a key parameter to evaluate fractal structures. A smaller RA corresponds to a flatter fractal configuration. By comparing flow rate, velocity, and mass distribution at the outlet of fractal channels with varying RA values, the results demonstrate that flatter fractal structures lead to more uniform flow distribution at the outlet. Meanwhile, the uniformity of fluid flow at the outlet of the fractal channels was analyzed. This work indicates that channel geometry significantly influences fluid dynamics, and also provides valuable insights into optimizing flow dynamics in small-scale applications, contributing to the design of more efficient fluidic devices.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of a Nutation Ring Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nutation triggered by external disturbances is an undesirable phenomenon for a spinning satellite. Passive decay in nutation angle must be achieved in such cases and benefits missions involving spin-stabilized satellites or mass-constrained satellites like CubeSats. Motivated by previous work of other authors, the dynamics of a general nutating satellite with an attached ring containing a viscous fluid is analyzed in a theoretical mechanics framework. The fluid in the ring is modeled as a rigid point mass and is then extended to a distributed rigid slug. The nonlinear equations of motion of the system, under the assumption of zero external torques, are studied in a body-fixed frame. Equilibrium points and system trajectories are studied on the angular momentum sphere. The settling time of the dynamical system after an initial disturbance is investigated. The energy dissipation is modeled using an approximate drag coefficient. Fluid dynamic effects are further examined through CFD simulations in the Navier-Stokes setting using the open-source software package ANSYS Fluent. Applications of the analysis and simulations to CubeSats are discussed.</description>

      <title>Flat-cupped transition in freezing drop impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the freezing of alkane drops impacted on a liquid bath. More specifically, for drops of hexadecane and tetradecane on brine, we found a morphological transition of the solid between a flat disk and a cupped shape. We show that this transition depends mainly on melting temperature and thermal shock, and varies weakly with impact velocity. We observed that the impact dynamics does not depend on the thermal shock before the drop starts to solid ify, which allows a rationalization of the solid size by models established for impact without phase change. Finally, we show that the relevant timescale setting the onset of solidification is associated with the formation of a thin solid layer between the drop and the bath, a timescale much shorter than the total solidification time. These findings offer the possibility to collapse the data for both liquids in a single phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Wetting and pressure gradient performance in a lattice Boltzmann color gradient model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate implementation of wetting and pressure drop is crucial to correctly reproducing fluid displacement processes in porous media. Although several strategies have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of them is needed to determine the most suitable for practical applications. Here, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate the performance of two widely used wettability schemes in the lattice Boltzmann color gradient model, namely the geometrical wetting scheme by Leclaire et al. (Scheme-I) and the modified direction of the color gradient scheme by Akai et al. (Scheme-II). We showed that Scheme-II was more accurate in simulating static contact angles of a fluid droplet on a solid surface. However, Scheme-I was more accurate in simulating a dynamic case of a binary fluid flow in a horizontal capillary tube described by the Washburn equation. Moreover, we investigated the performance of two popular pressure gradient implementation types. Type-I used the so-called Zou-He pressure boundary conditions at the inlet and the outlet of the domain, while Type-II used an external body force as a pressure gradient. We showed that the Type-I implementation was slightly more accurate in simulating a neutrally wetting fluid in a horizontal capillary tube described by the Washburn equation. We also investigated the differences between the two types of pressure gradient implementation in simulating two fluid displacement processes in a Bentheimer sandstone rock sample: the primary drainage and the imbibition displacement processes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>
