      <title>Morphing the left atrium geometry: The role of the pulmonary veins on flow patterns and thrombus formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Although significant advances have been made in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the left atrium (LA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions, the connection between atrial structure, flow dynamics, and blood stagnation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. Deepening our understanding of this connection would have important clinical implications, as the thrombi formed within the LAA are one of the main causes of stroke.
  Aim: To highlight and better understand the fundamental role of the PV orientation in the formation of atrial flow patterns, and quantifying systematically its effect on blood stasis within the LAA.
  Methods: Two patients with different types of atrial flow patterns were selected for the study. The atria were segmented and subsequently morphed to modify the PV orientation in a highly controlled manner. CFD analysis was performed using a kinematic model to reproduce AF conditions. Results were projected into the universal left atrial appendage coordinate (ULAAC) system to enhance data visualization and comparison.
  Results: The position of the main atrial vortex, which governs the atrial flow patterns, is significantly influenced by variations in the PV orientation. Moreover, the flow split ratio affects how the position of the main atrial vortex influences the formation of a stagnant region within the LAA and, thus, the risk of stroke. These findings may have important clinical implications, as standard clinical practice does not take into account PV orientations, flow split ratio, or LA morphology when assessing stroke risk for a particular patient.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of radiomic feature harmonization techniques for benign and malignant pulmonary nodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiomics provides quantitative features of pulmonary nodules (PNs) which could aid lung cancer diagnosis, but medical image acquisition variability is an obstacle to clinical application. Acquisition effects may differ between radiomic features from benign vs. malignant PNs. PURPOSE: We evaluated how to account for differences between benign and malignant PNs when correcting radiomic features' acquisition dependency. METHODS: We used 567 chest CT scans grouped as benign, malignant, or lung cancer screening (mixed benign, malignant). ComBat harmonization was applied to extracted features for variation in 4 acquisition parameters. We compared: harmonizing without distinction, harmonizing with a covariate to preserve distinctions between subgroups, and harmonizing subgroups separately. Significant ($p\le0.05$) Kruskal-Wallis tests showed whether harmonization removed acquisition dependency. A LASSO-SVM pipeline was trained on successfully harmonized features to predict malignancy. To evaluate predictive information in these features, the trained harmonization estimators and predictive model were applied to unseen test sets. Harmonization and predictive performance were assessed for 10 trials of 5-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: An average 2.1% of features (95% CI:1.9-2.4%) were acquisition-independent when harmonized without distinction, 27.3% (95% CI:25.7-28.9%) when harmonized with a covariate, and 90.9% (95% CI:90.4-91.5%) when harmonized separately. Data harmonized separately or with a covariate trained models with higher ROC-AUC for screening scans than data harmonized without distinction between benign and malignant PNs (Delong test, adjusted $p\le0.05$). CONCLUSIONS: Radiomic features of benign and malignant PNs need different corrective transformations to recover acquisition-independent distributions. This can be done by harmonizing separately or with a covariate.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Optimization of Interferometric Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (iDWS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that light speckle fluctuations provide a means for noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood flow index (CBFi). While conventional Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) provides marginal brain sensitivity for CBFi in adult humans, new techniques have recently emerged to improve diffuse light throughput and thus, brain sensitivity. Here we further optimize one such approach, interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (iDWS), with respect to number of independent channels, camera duty cycle and full well capacity, incident power, noise and artifact mitigation, and data processing. We build the system on a cart and define conditions for stable operation. We show pulsatile CBFi monitoring at 4-4.5 cm source-collector separation in adults with moderate pigmentation (Fitzpatrick 4). We also report preliminary clinical measurements in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit (Neuro ICU). These results push the boundaries of iDWS CBFi monitoring performance beyond previous reports.</description>

      <title>A multiscale radiation biophysical stochastic model describing the cell survival response at ultra-high dose rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high dose-rate (UHDR) radiotherapy, characterized by an extremely high radiation delivery rate, represents one of the most recent and promising frontier in radiotherapy. UHDR radiotherapy, addressed in the field as FLASH radiotherapy, is a disruptive treatment modality with several benefits, including significantly shorter treatment times, unchanged effectiveness in treating tumors, and clear reductions in side effects on normal tissues. While the benefits of UHDR irradiation have been well highlighted experimentally, the biological mechanism underlying the FLASH effect is still unclear and highly debated. Nonetheless, to effectively use UHDR radiotherapy in clinics, understanding the driving biological mechanism is paramount. Since the concurrent involvement of multiple scales of radiation damage has been suggested, we developed the MultiScale Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (MS-GSM2), a multi-stage extension of the GSM2, which is a probabilistic model describing the time evolution of the DNA damage in an irradiated cell nucleus. The MS-GSM2 can investigate several chemical species combined effects, DNA damage formation, and time evolution. We demonstrate that the MS-GSM2 can predict various in-vitro UHDR experimental results across various oxygenation levels, radiation types, and energies. The MS-GSM2 can accurately describe the empirical trend of dose and dose rate-dependent cell sensitivity over a wide range, consistently describing multiple aspects of the FLASH effect and reproducing the main evidence from the in-vitro experimental data. Our model also proposes a consistent explanation for the differential outcomes observed in normal tissues and tumors, in-vivo and in-vitro.</description>

      <title>A Generalizable 3D Diffusion Framework for Low-Dose and Few-View Cardiac SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myocardial perfusion imaging using SPECT is widely utilized to diagnose coronary artery diseases, but image quality can be negatively affected in low-dose and few-view acquisition settings. Although various deep learning methods have been introduced to improve image quality from low-dose or few-view SPECT data, previous approaches often fail to generalize across different acquisition settings, limiting their applicability in reality. This work introduced DiffSPECT-3D, a diffusion framework for 3D cardiac SPECT imaging that effectively adapts to different acquisition settings without requiring further network re-training or fine-tuning. Using both image and projection data, a consistency strategy is proposed to ensure that diffusion sampling at each step aligns with the low-dose/few-view projection measurements, the image data, and the scanner geometry, thus enabling generalization to different low-dose/few-view settings. Incorporating anatomical spatial information from CT and total variation constraint, we proposed a 2.5D conditional strategy to allow the DiffSPECT-3D to observe 3D contextual information from the entire image volume, addressing the 3D memory issues in diffusion model. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on 1,325 clinical 99mTc tetrofosmin stress/rest studies from 795 patients. Each study was reconstructed into 5 different low-count and 5 different few-view levels for model evaluations, ranging from 1% to 50% and from 1 view to 9 view, respectively. Validated against cardiac catheterization results and diagnostic comments from nuclear cardiologists, the presented results show the potential to achieve low-dose and few-view SPECT imaging without compromising clinical performance. Additionally, DiffSPECT-3D could be directly applied to full-dose SPECT images to further improve image quality, especially in a low-dose stress-first cardiac SPECT imaging protocol.</description>

      <title>Exploitation of the nonresonant background of Multiplex-Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering for label-free discrimination of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach using Multiplex-Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (M-CARS) for la-bel-free discriminations in biomedical tissues. The strategy is based on the evaluation of the contrast be-tween resonant and nonresonant contributions in a M-CARS hyperspectral dataset, and tested to identify and differentiate thin actin filaments from thick myosin filaments in muscle tissue without any labeling. First step consists in ensuring knowledge of the spatial regions containing thick myosin filaments thanks to its endogenous second harmonic signal, deducing expected location for thin actin filaments between myosin filaments. The ratio of resonant and nonresonant contributions for each pixel of the hyperspectral image allows then to discriminate actin from myosin filaments, whose localization is in accordance with the SHG probing. This qualitative imaging represents a proof of principle for highlighting and discriminat-ing purposes in biological microscopy, thanks to the difference in the nonlinear properties of the related proteins. This paves the way for considering label-free imaging through a competition between two third-order nonlinear signatures.</description>
