      <title>Toeplitz algebra and Symbol map via Berezin transform on $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ be the Toeplitz algebra, that is, the $C^*$-algebra generated by the set $\{T_{\phi} : \phi\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})\}$. Douglas's theorem on symbol map states that there exists a $C^*$-algebra homomorphism from $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ onto $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ such that $T_{\phi}\mapsto \phi$ and the kernel of the homomorphism coincides with commutator ideal in $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$. In this paper, we use the Berezin transform to study results akin to Douglas's theorem for operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the open unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$ for $n\geq 1$. We further obtain a class of bigger $C^*$-algebras than the Toeplitz algebra $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^n))$ for which the analog of symbol map still holds true.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoid Methods for Metric Entropy Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new methodology for the characterization of the metric entropy of infinite-dimensional ellipsoids with exponentially decaying semi-axes. This procedure does not rely on the explicit construction of coverings or packings and provides a unified framework for the derivation of the metric entropy of a wide variety of analytic function classes, such as periodic functions analytic on a strip, analytic functions bounded on a disk, and functions of exponential type. In each of these cases, our results improve upon the best known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Invariant embeddings and ergodic obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following question: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Assume that $\mathcal{A}$ is invariant under conjugation by a unitary operator $U$, i.e., $U^* AU$ is in $\mathcal{A}$ for every member $A$ of $\mathcal{A}$. Is there a maximal abelian self-adjoint algebra containing $\mathcal{A}$, which is still invariant under conjugation by $U$? The answer, which is easily seen to be yes in finite dimensions, is not trivial in general. We prove affirmative answers in special cases including the one where $\mathcal{A}$ is generated by a compact operator. We also construct a counterexample in the general case, whose existence is perhaps surprising.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Theorem for the Perron--Frobenius Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perron--Frobenius theorem in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be breifly stated as follows: Given a Hilbert cone in a real Hilbert space, a bounded positive self-adjoint operator $A$ is ergodic with respect to this cone if and only if the maximum eigenvalue $\|A\|$ of $A$ is simple, and the corresponding eigenvector is strictly positive with respect to this cone. This paper addresses the inverse problem of the Perron--Frobenius theorem: Does there exist a Hilbert cone such that a given bounded positive self-adjoint operator $A$ becomes ergodic when its maximum eigenvalue $\|A\|$ is simple? We provide an affirmative answer to this question in this paper. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of a specialized Hilbert cone introduced to obtain this result. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example of an application of the obtained results to the heat semigroup generated by the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator</description>

      <title>Norm bounds for self-adjoint Toeplitz operators with non-radial symbols on the Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Galbis' elegant norm bounds for self-adjoint Toeplitz operators on the Fock space to bounded and integrable symbols which are non-radial. The main ingredients are a transplantation of the remarkable Nicola-Tilli isoperimetric inequality to the realm of Fock-Toeplitz operator theory and a two-dimensional adaption of Galbis' integration and approximation arguments.</description>

      <title>Lattice renormings of $C_0(X)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ is a locally compact Polish space, and $G$ is a group of lattice isometries of $C_0(X)$ which satisfies certain conditions. Then we can equip $C_0(X)$ with an equivalent lattice norm $| \! | \! | \cdot | \! | \! |$ so that $G$ is the group of lattice isometries of $(C_0(X), | \! | \! | \cdot | \! | \! |)$. As an application, we show that for any locally compact Polish group $G$ there exists a locally compact Polish space $X$, and an lattice norm $| \! | \! | \cdot | \! | \! |$ on $C_0(X)$, so that $G$ is the group of lattice isometries of $(C_0(X), | \! | \! | \cdot | \! | \! |)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\in[1,\infty]$. Being motivated by weakly $p$-convergent and weak$^\ast$ $p$-convergent operators between Banach spaces introduced by Fourie and Zeekoei, we introduce and study the classes of weakly $p$-convergent and weak$^\ast$ $p$-convergent operators between arbitrary locally convex spaces. Relationships between these classes of operators are given, and we show that they have ideal properties. Numerous characterizations of weakly $p$-convergent and weak$^\ast$ $p$-convergent operators are given.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of infinite dimensional dissipative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singular operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike in the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>

      <title>On a weighted Hermite-Hadamard inequality involving convex functional arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in investigating a weighted variant of Hermite-Hadamard type inequalities involving convex functionals. The approach undertaken makes it possible to refine and reverse certain inequalities already known in the literature. It also allows us to provide new weighted convex functional means and establish some related properties with respect to some standard means.</description>

      <title>Benedicks-type uncertainty principle for metaplectic time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaplectic Wigner distributions are joint time-frequency representations that are parametrized by a symplectic matrix and generalize the short-time Fourier transform and the Wigner distribution.
  We investigate the question which metaplectic Wigner distributions satisfy an uncertainty principle in the style of Benedicks and Amrein-Berthier. That is, if the metaplectic Wigner distribution is supported on a set of finite measure, must the functions then be zero? While this statement holds for the short-time Fourier transform, it is false for some other natural time-frequency representations. We provide a full characterization of the class of metaplectic Wigner distributions which exhibit an uncertainty principle of this type, both for sesquilinear and quadratic versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Riesz potentials for non-Lebesgue measurable functions by taking the integrals in the sense of Choquet with respect to Hausdorff content and prove boundedness results for these operators. Some earlier results are recovered or extended now using integrals taken in the sense of Choquet with respect to Hausdorff content. Some earlier results also for maximal operators are considered, but now for non-measurable functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>

      <title>A new class of Carleson measures and integral operators on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\mathbf{g}=(g_0,g_1,\cdots,g_{n-1})$, with $g_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $k=0,1,\cdots,n-1$. Let $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ be the generalized Volterra-type operators on $H(\mathbb{C})$, which is represented as $$ I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n\left(fg_0+f'g_1+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}\right), $$ where $I$ denotes the integration operator $$(If)(z)=\int_0^zf(w)dw,$$ and $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of $I$. This operator is a generalization of the operator that was introduced by Chalmoukis in \cite{Cn}. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ acting on Bergman spaces to another. As a consequence of these characterizations, we obtain conditions for certain linear differential equations to have solutions in Bergman spaces. Moreover, we study the boundedness, compactness and Hilbert-Schmidtness of the following sums of generalized weighted composition operators: Let $\mathbf{u}=(u_0,u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ with $u_k\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for $0\leq k\leq n$ and $\varphi$ be an analytic self-map of $\mathbb{D}.$ The sums of generalized weighted composition operators is defined by $$L_{\mathbf{u},\varphi}^{(n)}=\sum_{k=0}^nW_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)},$$ where $$W_{u_k,\varphi}^{(k)}f=u_k\cdot f^{(k)}\circ\varphi.$$ Our approach involves the study of new class of Sobolev-Carleson measures for classical Bergman spaces on unit disk which appears in the first main Theorems \ref{Theorem1.1} and \ref{Theorem1.2}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give partial affirmative answers to Landis conjecture in all dimensions for two different types of linear, second order, elliptic operators in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we provide a sharp decay criterion that ensures when a solution of a nonnegative Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a potential $V\leq 1$ is trivial. Moreover, we address the analogue of Landis conjecture for quasilinear problems. Our approach relies on the application of Liouville comparison principles and criticality theory.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new vanishing subspaces of the homogeneous H\"{o}lder space $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(X,Y),$ in the generality of a doubling modulus $\omega$ and normed spaces $X$ and $Y.$ For many couples $X,Y,$ we show these vanishing subspaces to completely characterize those H\"older functions that admit approximations, in the H\"{o}lder seminorm, by smooth, Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions. Beyond the intrinsic interest of these results, we also present connections to bi-parameter harmonic analysis on the Euclidean space and in particular to compactness of the bi-commutator.</description>

Abstract: We study operators carrying disjoint bounded subsets of a Banach lattice into compact, weakly compact, and limited subsets of a Banach space. Surprisingly, these operators behave differently with classical compact, weakly compact, and limited operators.

      <title>Almost periodic and Asymptotically Almost Periodic Navier-Stokes flows on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic (AP-) and asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies negative and bounded conditions on Ricci curvature tensor. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of AP- and AAP- mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the ones for Navier-Stokes equations obtained in \cite{Xuan2022}.</description>

      <title>The concept of mapped coercivity for nonlinear operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concise proof of existence for nonlinear operator equations in separable Banach spaces. Notably, the operator is not assumed to be monotone. Instead, our main hypotheses consist of a continuity assumption and a generalized coercivity property. Mapped coercivity is a generalization of the usual coercivity property for nonlinear operators. In the case of linear operators, we recover linear coercivity and the traditional inf-sup condition. To illustrate the applicability of this general concept, we apply it to semi-linear elliptic problems and the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Integral Resolvent and Proximal Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of Hilbert direct integrals, we introduce and study a monotonicity-preserving operation, termed the integral resolvent mixture. It combines arbitrary families of monotone operators acting on different spaces and linear operators. As a special case, we investigate the resolvent expectation, an operation which combines monotone operators in such a way that the resulting resolvent is the Lebesgue expectation of the individual resolvents. Along the same lines, we introduce an operation that mixes arbitrary families of convex functions defined on different spaces and linear operators to create a composite convex function. Such constructs have so far been limited to finite families of operators and functions. The subdifferential of the integral proximal mixture is shown to be the integral resolvent mixture of the individual subdifferentials. Applications to the relaxation of systems of composite monotone inclusions are presented.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale analysis of minimizers for a second order regularization of the Perona-Malik functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of minimizers for the singularly perturbed Perona-Malik functional in one dimension. In a previous study, we have shown that blow-ups of these minimizers at a suitable scale converge to staircase-like piecewise constant functions.
  Building upon these findings, we delve into finer scales, revealing that both the vertical and horizontal regions of the staircase steps display cubic polynomial behavior after appropriate rescaling.
  Our analysis hinges on identifying the dominant terms of the functional within each regime, elucidating the mechanisms driving the observed asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Traces of vanishing H\"older spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an arbitrary subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and the scales $\Gamma = \textit{small, large, far},$ we introduce and study the $\Gamma$-vanishing subspaces $\dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(E)\subset \dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ of the H\"older spaces. We find a single bounded linear extension operator that maps $\dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(E)\to \dot{\operatorname{VC}}_{\Gamma}^{\omega}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and works separately for each of the three vanishing scales. In fact, this follows as the zeroth order special case of a more general problem involving higher order derivatives. As a corollary, we obtain complete characterizations of approximability of H\"older functions $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ by Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions, for an arbitrary subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <title>Classification Theorem For Positive Critical Points Of Sobolev Trace Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Euler-Lagrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality and prove several classification results. Exploiting the moving sphere method, it has been shown, when $p=2$, positive solutions of Euler-Lagrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality are classified. Since the moving sphere method strongly relies on the symmetries of the equation, in this paper we use asymptotic estimates and two important integral identities to classify positive solutions of Euler-Langrange equation of Sobolev trace inequality under finite energy when $1&lt;p&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotically Almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>
