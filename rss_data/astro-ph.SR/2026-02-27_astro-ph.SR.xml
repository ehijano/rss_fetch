      <title>Halo Photometry and Asteroseismology for 98 of the Brightest Stars Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $\delta$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $\Delta\nu$ for one of them, $\beta$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus variability in $\alpha$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $\epsilon$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $\gamma$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0--2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy -- referred to as the cosmological Li problem -- is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8--13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0--2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.</description>

      <title>Identify ~20,000 Li-rich Giants in the LAMOST Low-Resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 {\AA} absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\rm{Li}) &gt; 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages. This work presents a large and homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants derived from the LAMOST low-resolution survey, which provides a reliable and valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.</description>

      <title>JWST-DECO: Temporal Variations in the Mid-IR Silicate Features of Two T Tauri Discs Based on Spitzer and JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.</description>

      <title>Automated Identification of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in Globular Clusters with Gaia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an automated approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, combining astronomical data with algorithmic methods. Using a dataset of 160 globular clusters and Python scripts, we matched stellar sources with Gaia data. Our script generates color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and uses the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers. Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity. Our approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency while providing valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Statistical Study of Rapid Blue Excursions as Mass Conduits in Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) are transient blue-shifted chromospheric absorption features widely interpreted as the on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules. We investigate their dynamic properties using high-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms. RBEs were identified through blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria and tracked using spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods to determine lifetimes and kinematic evolution. The statistical analysis shows that RBEs are short-lived events with lifetimes predominantly between 20 to 60 s and a mean duration of approximately 75 s. The lifetime distribution follows an exponential decay profile, indicative of impulsive driving. Line-of-sight velocities range from 20 to 140 km s-1, with a mean near 26 km s-1. Projected lengths span 1.2-5.5 Mm with sub-arcsecond widths, and recurrence analysis reveals repeated activity at localized magnetic footpoints. Mass flux estimates suggest that RBEs transport significant plasma upward, contributing to chromospheric mass supply toward the corona. These findings reinforce the role of RBEs as dynamic conduits of mass transfer and key elements in chromosphere-corona coupling.</description>

      <title>Detection of circumstellar disks around nearby young brown dwarf candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Eating planets makes you younger: The magnetic dynamo rejuvenation of GJ 504 by planetary engulfment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\rm \dot{J}$). We then compared $\rm \dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\rm \dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.</description>

      <title>Characterising the magnetospheric accretion process of DF Tauri's primary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion process in young stellar objects (YSOs) is fundamental to the formation of stellar systems. This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. We also identified a significant difference in the magnetic topology of the two stars querying the influence of accretion of the evolution of the magnetic field, or capture of the secondary star.</description>

      <title>Searching for low-mass stars with magnetically-induced hyper-inflated radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise empirical estimates of stellar radii have revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions: the largest inflations occur in magnetically active stars. Theoretically, the radii of magnetically active stars are in some cases found to be 'hyper-inflated' to roughly double the radius of a non-magnetic star with equal mass. Here we ask, do data exist which could allow us to search for empirical evidence in support of hyper-inflated stars? A photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may help us in our search. The Cruz et al. study, although subject to large uncertainties, hints at the presence of hyper-inflation in some of the 88 stars in their sample. Their data enable us to set theoretical limits on the maximum strength Bc of magnetic fields inside their sample stars. According to our magneto-convective model, the average empirical inflations found from analysis of the Cruz et al. data can be replicated if Bc approx. 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than ~ 0.6 MSun. On the other hand, in stars with masses less than about 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the average empirical inflations of the stars may approach hyper-inflated status. Such stars may require significantly stronger internal fields, i.e. Bc approx. 100-300 kG. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Kepler binaries could help to confirm or refute our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Sulfur fractionation in coronal plumes as observed by Solar Orbiter/SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal plumes are bright, narrow structures rooted in coronal holes that contribute to the solar wind. Their composition, particularly elemental fractionation as a function of first ionization potential (FIP), provides diagnostics of plasma properties and magnetic connectivity. Earlier plume studies of fractionation using low-FIP elements reached conflicting conclusions. Intermediate-FIP elements may provide additional diagnostic insight, since their fractionation is thought to involve processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species. We investigate sulfur (intermediate-FIP element) in plumes to assess the presence of fractionation, its evolution, and its relation to wave activity. We analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March--April 2024, using Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) to derive the sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. EUV imaging and magnetograms provided additional context. Data were processed with the open-source Python tool Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise (SAFFRON). Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, in contrast with the surrounding interplume plasma. These results provide the evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, wave dynamics in the chromosphere as a driver.</description>

      <title>Tidal Synchronization of Binaries in Pleiades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions in close binaries play a key role in the long-term rotational and orbital evolution. The distributions of circularization across open clusters (OCs) place strong observational constraints on tidal dissipation in binaries. However, direct observational constraints on synchronization among binaries in OCs remain limited. For the 125 Myr OC Pleiades, this work combines cluster membership from Gaia Data Release 3, rotation periods from the K2 mission, and orbital solutions of the binary population from a long-term spectroscopic survey, to investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the pseudo-synchronization period to the rotation period of the primary stars. Among 42 binaries with reliable orbital periods Porb and rotation periods, we identify seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb &lt; 8.6 days, including one early-type system and six late-type systems. For binaries with longer Porb, primaries generally are super-synchronized, and most systems are eccentric. We find a synchronization transition near Porb ~ 8.6-14 days, comparable to the known circularization period (Porb ~ 7.2 days) in the Pleiades, which suggests similar critical period scales for synchronization and circularization in this coeval population. Synchronization depends much more strongly on mass ratio than on primary mass. Most synchronized systems in Pleiades have high mass ratios and are likely to evolve into double white dwarf systems. Tides likely impose strong rotational braking on close early-type binaries, while their influence on late-type close binaries is weaker, and their spins largely follow the single-star sequence.</description>

      <title>Dyson spheres on H-R diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Dyson spheres, megastructures designed to capture the total radiative output of stars, can be one of the most compelling techno-signature scenarios for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. By considering equilibrium temperatures, we investigate the luminosities and fluxes of Dyson spheres built around two promising classes of host stars: white dwarfs and red M-dwarfs. Using radiative balance arguments and representative stellar parameters, we compute the temperature-radius relationship for full energy interception and place these hypothetical structures on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram to assess their observational signatures. Our results show that Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler and fainter blackbody emissions, peaking in the near- to mid-infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths. In both cases, the equilibrium temperature decreases as R_ D^-1/2, while the total luminosity and observed bolometric flux remain fixed by the stellar output. These findings highlight the astrophysical suitability of low-luminosity stars as Dyson sphere hosts and provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Perseus Cluster II: Metallicity-Dependence of Massive Stars and Chemical Enrichment History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The legacy Hitomi telescope has delivered the precise measurements of the chemical abundances in the Perseus Cluster, covering the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). In Paper I (Leung et al., ApJ 2025), we examined the role of convection parameters and presented new core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion models at solar metallicity, which fit the observed abundance pattern. In this article, we extend our calculation for the stellar evolutionary models and CCSN models of the initial mass $15 - 60M_{\odot}$ and the metallicity $Z = 0 - Z_{\odot}$. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of $\alpha$-chain elements (e.g., Si, S, Ar), odd-number elements (e.g., P, K, Cl), and iron-group elements (e.g., Mn, Ni). We study the role of CCSNe in the production of these elements. We compare the galactic chemical evolution model based on the nucleosynthesis yield of the new massive stars and other yield tables from the literature. For each supernova yield, we perform parameter surveys and search for configurations that produce the best-fit model and best-rate model using the Perseus Cluster as the reference. From the survey, we study how individual chemical elements affect the contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae in the cosmic chemical enrichment</description>

      <title>Fluctuating polytropic processes, turbulence, and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes and their connection to turbulence. It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 Analysis of Four Open Clusters Toward the Galactic Anticenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.</description>

      <title>Anomalous cosmic rays within the inner heliosphere: Observations of helium by the High Energy Telescope onboard Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial gradients of cosmic rays are key parameters for understanding the transport of particles in space. Solar Orbiter, launched on 2020 February 10, approaches the Sun approximately every half year, with a closest perihelion distance of 0.29 au after the end of 2022 during the nominal mission phase. The two double-ended high energy telescopes(HET)onboard the Solar Orbiter measure energetic particles in the energy range between a few MeV/nuc and a few hundred MeV/nuc, which are dominated by anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) during solar quiet times. By obtaining the radial gradient of the ACR helium in the inner heliosphere, we advance our understanding of how the transport of the cosmic rays is affected by the particle drift effect and the large-scale magnetic field. The helium observations at Solar Orbiter/HET between 11.1 and 49 MeV/nuc are analyzed. Since we focus on quiet time measurements, we remove the periods of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensities are averaged over the Carrington rotation period. The helium observations from the Proton and Helium Instrument(EPHIN)onboard SOHO were utilized as the baseline to correct the long-term variation caused by the solar modulations. We present the first observation of ACR helium at Solar Orbiter/HET between 2020 February and 2022 July in the inner heliosphere before the sun became fully active. We derive the radial gradient of the ACR helium between 0.3 and 1 au. The averaged radial gradient between 11.1 and 49MeV/nuc is about 22$\pm$4%/au and the averaged value between 11.1 and 41.2MeV/nuc is raised to 32$\pm$8%/au after removing the GCR contribution, which is estimated by a GCR model. In addition, the temporal variation of radial gradients indicates that the gradients are increasing with the enhancement of the solar modulation and the increased tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian subatomic physics community establishes its scientific, and thus funding, priorities through periodic Long-Range Plans (LRP). The community is now putting together a new LRP, which will be in effect from 2027 through 2034, with its scope extending through 2041. As part of this process, the Canadian Institute of Nuclear Physics (CINP) has put together a strategic report, following an extensive consultation process. The report describes the broad and ambitious research program undertaken by the Canadian nuclear physics research community, both onshore and abroad, touching on key questions regarding the origin, evolution, and structure of visible matter in the universe. This document provides a grid of different Canadian nuclear physics projects undertaken now and in the future, and their associated timelines. It concludes with specific recommendations for maximizing Canadian scientific output in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>PICASO 4.0: Clouds and Photochemistry in Climate Models of Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a major update to the open-source atmospheric modeling package \texttt{PICASO}, designed for simulating the thermal structure and spectra of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This release, \texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.</description>

      <title>High Spectral Resolution X-ray Observations of the Evolved Supermassive Stellar Binary System $\eta$ Carinae - Iron K$\alpha$ Band Profile Revealed with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supermassive binary system, $\eta$ Carinae, is experiencing enormous wind-driven mass loss at a rate unparalleled in the rest of the Galaxy. Their wind-wind collision (WWC) continuously produces shock heated, X-ray emitting plasmas. The XRISM X-ray observatory observed the system in 2023 and 2024 when the X-ray emission began to increase toward periastron passage in 2025. This manuscript reports unprecedentedly high-resolution X-ray spectra in the iron K$\alpha$ band between 6.2 and 7.1 keV, obtained with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter. The hydrogen-like (Ly$\alpha$) and helium-like (He$\alpha$) lines reveal three velocity components. Two of them are broadened with maximum velocities of 2000-3000 km/s, likely originating from the post-shock companion wind. The other is relatively narrow, with a Gaussian broadening of only ~290 km/s in 1 sigma, which may originate from the post-shock companion wind at the WWC stagnation point or penetrating the primary wind. The iron fluorescent lines exhibit a moderate blueshift and broadening with velocities at 100-200 km/s, consistent with the primary wind's velocity field. The spectra also confirm a Compton shoulder of the He$\alpha$ line complex for the first time. Both fluorescing and scattering spectral profiles indicate that the binary system is seen from the companion side during these observations. The flux ratio of the Compton scattering emission to the fluorescent line suggests substantial hydrogen depletion of the primary wind, expected from CNO-cycled hydrogen nuclear fusion gas.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Nulling in Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nulling is a phenomenon where the emission from a pulsar becomes undetectable (or significantly weaker) for a relatively short period of time, followed by a return to a normal emission state. The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population.</description>

      <title>Investigating potential benefits of future sub-L1 missions with STEREO-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first statistical study of geomagnetic storm forecasting using in situ data from the STEREO-A spacecraft as a sub-L1 monitor. Between November 2022 and June 2024, STEREO-A crossed the Sun-Earth line, covering longitudinal and radial separations of +/-15{\deg} from the Sun-Earth line and 0.01-0.06 au from Earth. This passage provides a unique opportunity to assess future sub-L1 mission concepts by ESA, such as HENON and SHIELD. We identify 32 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by both STEREO-A and L1 spacecraft. Eight of these 32 CME events are first detected at L1, indicating that radial spacecraft separations of up to ~0.05 au do not always yield lead time advantages. Furthermore, we find greater (smaller) gains in lead time when STEREO-A is east (west) of the Sun-Earth line. We develop a baseline methodology for the use of future sub-L1 in situ data to enable time-shifting and real-time modeling of the geomagnetic SYM-H index. This is run continuously over the entire time period, therefore modeling the geomagnetic response of all solar wind structures. Our methodology is empirically motivated and should be considered a first approach in addressing the use of sub-L1 data. Following this methodology, 26 of 47 observed geomagnetic storms are correctly identified from STEREO-A data. Intense events (82%, SYM-H&lt;-100 nT) are well detected, most of which are also associated with an identified CME event. Most SYM-H minima are predicted later (72%) and stronger (58%) than those observed due to biases introduced by our methodology.</description>

      <title>TEPCat: The Transiting Extrasolar Planet Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiting extrasolar planets are extraordinarily valuable for understanding the characteristics and formation of planets, because they are the only exoplanets whose physical and orbital properties can be measured to high precision. Thousands are now known, and it is important to maintain a database of them for use by the scientific community. TEPCat performs this task: it is a critical compilation of the physical and observable properties of the known transiting planetary systems. This work introduces the motivation for TEPCat, its scope, contents, and implementation. Example plots of interesting quantities are constructed. The classification of planets and of the eclipse features in their light curves is discussed. TEPCat is maintained and freely available online at https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/</description>

      <title>The extremely low-luminosity Type Iax SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optical follow-up of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx, two examples from the Iax subclass of thermonuclear supernova (SN) events. With peak absolute magnitudes of $M_\mathrm{V} = -13.7$ and $-14.4$ mag, respectively, both objects belong to the extremely low-luminosity (EL) population of the class. A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs remain uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>The winds of OBA hypergiants and luminous blue variables: Dynamically-consistent atmosphere models reveal multiple wind regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OBA hypergiants (OBAHGs) are evolved massive stars with notable wind features in their optical spectrum. Located at the cool edge of the line-driven wind regime, many are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs) likely near the Eddington limit. Although brief, this evolutionary stage deeply affects their surroundings and subsequent evolution.
  We study the mechanisms behind OBAHG winds and spectra, covering the temperature range of non-eruptive LBVs. Using the PoWR atmosphere code, we compute models with an Eddington parameter Gamma_e ~ 0.4 and moderate turbulent pressure, typical for cool hypergiants, varying the effective temperature from ~12.5 to ~38.0 kK at solar metallicity.
  Our models show a complex temperature-dependent mass-loss pattern, with regions of higher/lower rates linked to two wind solutions: "dense" and "rarefied." Spectra of known OBAHGs and LBVs match models from all solution regions. We find bi-stability jumps -- with sharp mass-loss increases -- at temperatures where Fe IV recombines to Fe III (and Fe III to Fe II). "Drops" in mass loss also occur when the leading Fe ion changes at wind onset, signaling a switch to rarefied solutions under insufficient driving opacity.
  The resulting velocity fields also reflect these different regimes: rarefied solutions match the empirical terminal velocity vs temperature relation, while dense ones deviate. Turbulent pressure is crucial for wind acceleration at cooler temperatures.
  We demonstrate that the bi-stability jumps exist in OBAHGs but are part of a broader complex behavior not replicated by current mass-loss recipes. Combining our and other recent results, we suggest that the switch between rarefied and dense solutions only occurs within a certain proximity to the Eddington Limit. Testing this requires future models with broader parameters and advanced treatments of radiatively-driven turbulence.</description>

      <title>Long Photometric Cycles in Double Periodic Variables from Nodal Precession of a Tilted Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the long photometric cycles observed in double-periodic variables (DPVs) can arise from nodal precession of a tilted accretion disk driven by the tidal torque of the companion. Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $\beta$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies -- sinusoidal and double-hump -- distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+\beta \le 90^\circ$ versus $i+\beta&gt;90^\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: nonpropagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <title>Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed. For these six systems, we measure the system-integrated polarization fraction and angle of linear polarization, providing quantitative constraints on their unresolved circumstellar environments.</description>
