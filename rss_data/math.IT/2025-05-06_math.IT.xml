      <title>Adaptive Passive Beamforming in RIS-Aided Communications With Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) appear as a promising solution to combat wireless channel fading and interferences. However, the elements of the RIS need to be properly oriented to boost the data transmission rate. In this work, we propose a new strategy to adaptively configure the RIS without Channel State Information (CSI). Our goal is to minimize the number of RIS configurations to be tested to find the optimal one. We formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path problem, and use Q-Learning to solve it.</description>

      <title>Resilient Vehicular Communications under Imperfect Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks provide a promising solution to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. One key challenge in such systems lies in meeting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of vehicular communication links given limited network resources, particularly under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions caused by the highly dynamic environment. In this paper, a novel two-phase framework is proposed to instill resilience into C-V2X networks under unknown imperfect CSI. The resilience of the C-V2X network is defined, quantified, and optimized the first time through two principal dimensions: absorption phase and adaptation phase. Specifically, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the imperfect CSI is estimated during the absorption phase through dedicated absorption power scheme and resource block (RB) assignment. The estimated PDF is further used to analyze the interplay and reveal the tradeoff between these two phases. Then, a novel metric named hazard rate (HR) is exploited to balance the C-V2X network's prioritization on absorption and adaptation. Finally, the estimated PDF is exploited in the adaptation phase to recover the network's QoS through a real-time power allocation optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the superior capability of the proposed framework in sustaining the QoS of the C-V2X network under imperfect CSI. Specifically, in the adaptation phase, the proposed design reduces the vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) delay that exceeds QoS requirement by 35% and 56%, and improves the average vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) throughput by 14% and 16% compared to the model-based and data-driven benchmarks, respectively, without compromising the network's QoS in the absorption phase.</description>

      <title>Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.</description>

      <title>Improved ALOHA-based URA with Index Modulation: Efficient Decoding and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an improved ALOHA-based unsourced random access (URA) scheme is proposed in MIMO channels. The channel coherent interval is divided into multiple sub-slots and each active user selects several sub-slots to send its codeword, namely, the channel access pattern. To be more specific, the data stream of each active user is divided into three parts. The first part is mapped as the compressed sensing (CS) pilot, which also serves for the consequent channel estimation. The second part is modulated by binary phase shift keying (BPSK). The obtained CS pilot and the antipodal BPSK signal are concatenated as its codeword. After that, the codeword of each active user is sent repeatedly based on its channel access pattern, which is determined by the third part of the information bits, namely, index modulation (IM). On the receiver side, a hard decision-based decoder is proposed which includes the CS decoder, maximal likelihood (ML)-based superposed codeword decomposer (SCD), and IM demodulator. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed decoder, a simplified SCD based on convex approximation is considered. The performance analysis is also provided. The exhaustive computer simulations confirm the superiority of our proposal.</description>

      <title>ResiTok: A Resilient Tokenization-Enabled Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Robust Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time transmission of visual data over wireless networks remains highly challenging, even when leveraging advanced deep neural networks, particularly under severe channel conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel Resilient Tokenization-Enabled (ResiTok) framework designed for ultra-low-rate image transmission that achieves exceptional robustness while maintaining high reconstruction quality. By reorganizing visual information into hierarchical token groups consisting of essential key tokens and supplementary detail tokens, ResiTok enables progressive encoding and graceful degradation of visual quality under constrained channel conditions. A key contribution is our resilient 1D tokenization method integrated with a specialized zero-out training strategy, which systematically simulates token loss during training, empowering the neural network to effectively compress and reconstruct images from incomplete token sets. Furthermore, the channel-adaptive coding and modulation design dynamically allocates coding resources according to prevailing channel conditions, yielding superior semantic fidelity and structural consistency even at extremely low channel bandwidth ratios. Evaluation results demonstrate that ResiTok outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic similarity and visual quality, with significant advantages under challenging channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Continuously Ordered Hierarchies of Algorithmic Information in Digital Twinning and Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fractional-calculus example of a continuous hierarchy of algorithmic information in the context of its potential applications in digital twinning. Digital twinning refers to different emerging methodologies in control engineering that involve the creation of a digital replica of some physical entity. From the perspective of computability theory, the problem of ensuring the digital twin's integrity -- i.e., keeping it in a state where it matches its physical counterpart -- entails a notion of algorithmic information that determines which of the physical system's properties we can reliably deduce by algorithmically analyzing its digital twin. The present work investigates the fractional calculus of periodic functions -- particularly, we consider the Wiener algebra -- as an exemplary application of the algorithmic-information concept. We establish a continuously ordered hierarchy of algorithmic information among spaces of periodic functions -- depending on their fractional degree of smoothness -- in which the ordering relation determines whether a certain representation of some function contains ``more'' or ``less'' information than another. Additionally, we establish an analogous hierarchy among lp-spaces, which form a cornerstone of (traditional) digital signal processing. Notably, both hierarchies are (mathematically) ``dual'' to each other. From a practical perspective, our approach ultimately falls into the category of formal verification and (general) formal methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Code Transceiver Design for Unsourced Random Access with Analytical Power Division in Gaussian MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the problem of unsourced random access (URA) over a Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC). To address the challenges posed by emerging massive machine-type connectivity, URA reframes multiple access as a coding-theoretic problem. The sparse code-oriented schemes are highly valued because they are widely used in existing protocols, making their implementation require only minimal changes to current networks. However, drawbacks such as the heavy reliance on extrinsic feedback from powerful channel codes and the lack of transmission robustness pose obstacles to the development of sparse codes. To address these drawbacks, a novel sparse code structure based on a universally applicable power division strategy is proposed. Comprehensive numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, by employing the proposed power division method, which is derived analytically and does not require extensive simulations, a performance improvement of approximately 2.8 dB is achieved compared to schemes with identical channel code setups.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic ODMA Receiver with Low-Complexity Algorithm for MIMO Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design for both pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free on-off multiple access (ODMA) receivers in unsourced random access (URA) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike pilot-coupled ODMA, where on-off patterns are linked to pilot selection, pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free ODMA reduce transmission redundancy but face challenges in processing complexity and capacity performance. The joint pattern and data detector (JPDD) design is critical for these schemes, but the current JPDD algorithm has high complexity with quadratic computational costs. To address this, we propose a low-complexity detector based on approximate message passing (AMP), which offers linear complexity, providing reduced cost and improved performance in the under-determined linear regression case. Decoding is initialized via pilot-free matrix factorization through alternating minimization, resolving phase and scalar ambiguities. Compared to existing pilot-free schemes, the proposed method achieves a 13 dB improvement and favorable trade-offs in complexity and capacity performance when compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Gaussian Graphical Models Defined on Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two Gaussian graphical models defined on complete bipartite graphs. We show that the determinants of the precision matrices associated with the models are equal up to scale, where the scale factor only depends on model parameters. In this context, we will introduce a notion of ``equivalence" between the two Gaussian graphical models. This equivalence has two key applications: first, it can significantly reduce the complexity of computing the exact value of the determinant, and second, it enables the derivation of closed-form expressions for the determinants in certain special cases.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Network for Off-Grid Imaging-based Low-Altitude Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy has emerged as a critical focus for future economic development, emphasizing the urgent need for flight activity surveillance utilizing the existing sensing capabilities of mobile cellular networks. Traditional monostatic or localization-based sensing methods, however, encounter challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that directly draws the radio images of the low-altitude space, leveraging its inherent sparsity with compressed sensing (CS)-based algorithms and the cooperation of multiple base stations. Furthermore, recognizing that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are randomly distributed in space, we introduce a physics-embedded learning method to overcome off-grid issues inherent in CS-based models. Additionally, an online hard example mining method is incorporated into the design of the loss function, enabling the network to adaptively concentrate on the samples bearing significant discrepancy with the ground truth, thereby enhancing its ability to detect the rare UAVs within the expansive low-altitude space. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the imaging-based low-altitude surveillance approach, with the proposed physics-embedded learning algorithm significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Integrated Communication and Localization with a Single Access Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) not only assist communication but also help the localization of user equipment (UE). This study focuses on the indoor localization of UE with a single access point (AP) aided by multiple RISs. First, we propose a two-stage channel estimation scheme where the phase shifts of RIS elements are tuned to obtain multiple channel soundings. In the first stage, the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm extracts the parameters of multiple paths from the received signals. Then, the LOS path and RIS-reflected paths are identified. In the second stage, the estimated path gains of RIS-reflected paths with different phase shifts are utilized to determine the angle of arrival (AOA) at the RIS by obtaining the angular pseudo spectrum. Consequently, by taking the AP and RISs as reference points, the linear least squares estimator can locate UE with the estimated AOAs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize centimeter-level localization accuracy in the discussed scenarios. Moreover, the higher accuracy of pseudo spectrum, a larger number of channel soundings, and a larger number of reference points can realize higher localization accuracy of UE.</description>

      <title>Learned Intelligent Recognizer with Adaptively Customized RIS Phases in Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced wireless system that embeds target recognition within reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communication systems, powered by cuttingedge deep learning innovations. Such a system faces the challenge of fine-tuning both the RIS phase shifts and neural network (NN) parameters, since they intricately interdepend on each other to accomplish the recognition task. To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent recognizer that strategically harnesses every piece of prior action responses, thereby ingeniously multiplexing downlink signals to facilitate environment sensing. Specifically, we design a novel NN based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture and the physical channel model. The NN iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements and adaptively customizes RIS configurations to acquire the most relevant information for the recognition task in subsequent moments. Tailored dynamically, these configurations adapt to the scene, task, and target specifics. Simulation results reveal that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, while resulting in minimal impacts on communication performance, even as sensing is performed simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Correcting Multiple Substitutions in Nanopore-Sequencing Reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their significant advantages over competing technologies, nanopore sequencers are plagued by high error rates, due to physical characteristics of the nanopore and inherent noise in the biological processes. It is thus paramount not only to formulate efficient error-correcting constructions for these channels, but also to establish bounds on the minimum redundancy required by such coding schemes. In this context, we adopt a simplified model of nanopore sequencing inspired by the work of Mao \emph{et al.}, accounting for the effects of intersymbol interference and measurement noise. For an input sequence of length $n$, the vector that is produced, designated as the \emph{read vector}, may additionally suffer at most \(t\) substitution errors. We employ the well-known graph-theoretic clique-cover technique to establish that at least \(t\log n -O(1)\) bits of redundancy are required to correct multiple (\(t \geq 2\)) substitutions. While this is surprising in comparison to the case of a single substitution, that necessitates at most \(\log \log n - O(1)\) bits of redundancy, a suitable error-correcting code that is optimal up to a constant follows immediately from the properties of read vectors.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of efficient decoding of codes from insertions and deletions. Most of the known efficient codes are codes with synchronization strings which allow one to reduce the problem of decoding insertions and deletions to that of decoding substitution and erasures. Our new approach, presented in this paper, reduces the problem of decoding insertions and deletions to that of list recovery. Specifically, any \((\rho, 2\rho n + 1, L)\)-list-recoverable code is a \((\rho, L)\)-list decodable insdel code. As an example, we apply this technique to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, which are known to have efficient list-recovery algorithms up to the Johnson bound. In the adversarial insdel model, this provides efficient (list) decoding from \(t\) insdel errors, assuming that \(t\cdot k = O(n)\). This is the first efficient insdel decoder for \([n, k]\) RS codes for \(k&gt;2\). Additionally, we explore random insdel models, such as the Davey-MacKay channel, and show that for certain choices of \(\rho\), a \((\rho, n^{1/2+0.001}, L)\)-list-recoverable code of length \(n\) can, with high probability, efficiently list decode the channel output, ensuring that the transmitted codeword is in the output list. In the context of RS codes, this leads to a better rate-error tradeoff for these channels compared to the adversarial case. We also adapt the Koetter-Vardy algorithm, a famous soft-decision list decoding technique for RS codes, to correct insertions and deletions induced by the Davey-MacKay channel.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT for IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</description>

      <title>Structured Estimators: A New Perspective on Information Freshness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent literature, when modeling for information freshness in remote estimation settings, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators, meaning the remote estimate at any time is equal to the most recently received update. This is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of analysis. However, these martingale estimators are far from optimal in some cases, especially in pull-based update systems. For such systems, maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimum, but can be challenging to analyze. Here, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which retain useful characteristics from a MAP estimate while still being analytically tractable. Our proposed estimators move seamlessly from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Online Conformal Anomaly Detection with Prediction-Powered Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Aware Unified Terrestrial Non-Terrestrial 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (TN-NTNs), which was introduced in 5G, is progressing toward a unified and seamless network of networks in Sixth-Generation (6G). This evolution leads to a significant increase in the volume of generated and communicated data, imposing technical and operational requirements accompanied by a higher cost and energy consumption. Efficiently managing the generation and transmission of data in these highly complex unified networks has become essential. In this article, we investigate the semantics-aware information handling problem within unified TN-NTNs, where data communication between the distant TN nodes is enabled via an NTN. To this end, an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is employed, where status updates from a remote IoT device are communicated to a destination monitor via a constellation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. We leverage semantic metrics that capture the timeliness, relevance, and utility of information to provide the most informative data for timely and informed decision-making and eventually reduce the volume of transmitted and processed data. The outcome is significantly lower energy consumption, memory, control, and processing requirements (up to 73% lower energy charging demands compared to the state-of-the-art), all without compromising the conveyed information.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Gauge-Invariant Quantum Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packaged quantum states are gauge-invariant states in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) form an inseparable block. This feature gives rise to novel packaged entanglements that encompass all IQNs, which is important both for fundamental physics and for quantum technology. Here we develop a framework for gauge-invariant quantum information processing based on packaged quantum states. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid packaged superposition state of a single particle and multi-particle. We then present the details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits), packaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge operator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum information science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes, quantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \times D$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics systems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and testable. 
Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may provide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Design and Channel Modeling of Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a novel design of electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) based on a fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed, and the corresponding wireless channel model is established. Different from conventional antenna arrays with static elements, the electromagnetic characteristics of each array element in the proposed ERA can be flexibly reconfigured into various states, introducing electromagnetic degrees of freedom to enhance wireless system performance. Based on the proposed ERA design, the corresponding channel model is developed. Finally, full-wave simulations are conducted to validate the overall design concept. The results reveal that a gain enhancement of 2.5 dB is achieved at a beamforming direction.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Hybrid Key Exchange Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textsc{CHOKE}, a novel code-based hybrid key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) designed to securely and efficiently transmit multiple session keys simultaneously. By encoding $n$ independent session keys with an individually secure linear code and encapsulating each resulting coded symbol using a separate KEM, \textsc{CHOKE} achieves computational individual security -- each key remains secure as long as at least one underlying KEM remains unbroken. Compared to traditional serial or combiner-based hybrid schemes, \textsc{CHOKE} reduces computational and communication costs by an $n$-fold factor. Furthermore, we show that the communication cost of our construction is optimal under the requirement that each KEM must be used at least once.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for CR-NOMA based Smart Grid Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.</description>

      <title>Antifragility of RIS-assisted Communication Systems under Jamming Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antifragility of communication systems is defined as measure of benefits gained from the adverse events and variability of its environment. In this paper, we introduce the notion of antifragility in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) assisted communication systems affected by a jamming attack. We analyzed the antifragility of the two hop systems, where the wireless path contains source node, RIS, destination node, and a eavesdropping/jamming node. We propose and analyze the antifragility performance for several jamming models, such as Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) and phase and amplitude shifting. Our paper shows that antifragility throughput can indeed be achieved under certain power thresholds and for various jamming models. In particular, high jamming power combined with low baseline data rates yields an antifragile gain factor of approximately five times. The results confirm that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, when coupled with an antifragile design philosophy, can convert hostile interference from a liability into a throughput gain.</description>

Moreover, we discuss other connected families of functions, for potential APN functions, but we show that they are not good candidates for APNess if the underlying field is large, in spite of the fact that they though they are APN for small environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized in various scientific fields, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In the presence of colored noise, the multivariate regression (MV-R) algorithm models the source detection as a multivariate regression problem and infers the model order from the covariance matrix of the residual error. However, the MV-R algorithm requires that the noise is sufficiently weaker than the signal. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel signal number estimation algorithm in the presence of colored noise based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Moreover, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria, the MV-R estimator and the RMT estimator to sequentially determine whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance than the existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a privacy-preserving event detection scheme based on measurements made by a network of sensors. A diameter-like decision statistic made up of the marginal types of the measurements observed by the sensors is employed. The proposed detection scheme can achieve the best type-I error exponent as the type-II error rate is required to be negligible. Detection performance with finite-length observations is also demonstrated through a simulation example of spectrum sensing. Privacy protection is achieved by obfuscating the sensors' marginal types with random zero-modulo-sum numbers that are generated and distributed via the exchange of encrypted messages among the sensors. The privacy-preserving performance against "honest but curious" adversaries, including colluding sensors, the fusion center, and external eavesdroppers, is analyzed through a series of cryptographic games. It is shown that the probability that any probabilistic polynomial time adversary successfully estimates the sensors' measured types cannot be much better than independent guessing, when there are at least two non-colluding sensors.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Movement Optimization of Aerial Base Stations Based on Global Connectivity Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial base stations (ABSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of extending wireless connectivity to ground users (GUs) across a variety of scenarios. However, it is an NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in $M$ and $N$, in order to maximize the coverage rate (CR) of $M$ GUs by jointly placing $N$ ABSs with limited coverage range. The complexity of the problem escalates in environments where the signal propagation is obstructed by localized obstacles such as buildings, and is further compounded by the dynamic GU positions. In response to these challenges, this paper focuses on the optimization of a multi-ABS movement problem, aiming to improve the mean CR for mobile GUs within a site-specific environment. Our proposals include 1) introducing the concept of global connectivity map (GCM) which contains the connectivity information between given pairs of ABS/GU locations; 2) partitioning the ABS movement problem into ABS placement sub-problems and formulate each sub-problem into a binary integer linear programming (BILP) problem based on GCM; 3) and proposing a fast online algorithm to execute (one-pass) projected stochastic subgradient descent within the dual space to rapidly solve the BILP problem with near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a high CR performance close to the upper bound obtained by the open-source solver (SCIP), yet with significantly reduced running time. Moreover, our method also outperforms common benchmarks in the literature such as the K-means initiated evolutionary algorithm or the ones based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in terms of CR performance and/or time efficiency.</description>

      <title>AFDM Channel Estimation in Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML channels.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <title>Revisit the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm: New Analysis with Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06013v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the seminal paper of Claude Shannon \cite{Shannon48}, the computation of the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel has been considered as one of the most important and fundamental problems in Information Theory. Nearly 50 years ago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve this problem in their seminal papers \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF, Blahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge to the capacity of the channel as $t \to \infty$ with the convergence rate upper bounded by $O\left(\log(m)/t\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input distribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in the interior of the input probability simplex \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently it was proved, in \cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is at worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.
  In this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of convergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is size of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the capacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution, for any sufficiently small constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, is inverse exponential $O\left(\log(m)/c^t\right)$, for a constant $c &gt; 1$ and $O\left(\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\left(m n\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tele-LLMs: A Series of Specialized Large Language Models for Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an explicit construction method for quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with a girth of 12. The proposed method designs parity-check matrices that maximize the girth while maintaining an orthogonal structure suitable for quantum error correction. By utilizing algebraic techniques, short cycles are eliminated, which improves error correction performance. Additionally, this method is extended to non-binary LDPC codes and spatially-coupled LDPC codes, demonstrating that both the girth and orthogonality can be preserved. The results of this study enable the design of high-performance quantum error-correcting codes without the need for random search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying imperfect cognition via achieved information gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognition, information processing in form of inference, communication, and memorization, is the central activity of any intelligence. Its physical realization in a brain, computer, or in any other intelligent system requires resources like time, energy, memory, bandwidth, money, and others. Due to limited resources, many real world intelligent systems perform only imperfect cognition. To understand the trade-off between accuracy and resource investments in existing systems, e.g. in biology, as well as for the resource-aware optimal design of information processing systems, like computer algorithms and artificial neural networks, a quantification of information obtained in an imperfect cognitive operation is desirable. To this end, we propose the concept of the achieved information gain (AIG) of a belief update, which is given by the amount of information obtained by updating from the initial state of knowledge to the ideal state, minus the amount that a change from the imperfect to the ideal state would yield. AIG has many desirable properties for quantifying imperfect cognition. The ratio of achieved to ideally obtainable information measures cognitive fidelity and that of AIG to the necessary cognitive effort measures cognitive efficiency. We provide an axiomatic derivation of AIG, relate it to other information measures, illustrate its application to common scenarios of posterior inaccuracies, and discuss the implication of cognitive efficiency for sustainable resource allocation in computational inference.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.</description>

      <title>From Freshness to Effectiveness: Goal-Oriented Sampling for Remote Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data freshness, measured by Age of Information (AoI), is highly relevant in networked applications such as Vehicle to Everything (V2X), smart health systems, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Yet, freshness alone does not equate to informativeness. In decision-critical settings, some stale data may prove more valuable than fresh updates. To explore this nuance, we move beyond AoI-centric policies and investigate how data staleness impacts decision-making under data-staleness-induced uncertainty. We pose a central question: What is the value of information, when freshness fades, and only its power to shape remote decisions remains? To capture this endured value, we propose AR-MDP, an Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process framework, which co-designs optimal sampling and remote decision-making under a sampling frequency constraint and random delay. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a new two-stage hierarchical algorithm namely Quick Bellman-Linear-Program (QuickBLP), where the first stage involves solving the Dinkelbach root of a Bellman variant and the second stage involves solving a streamlined linear program (LP). For the tricky first stage, we propose a new One-layer Primal-Dinkelbach Synchronous Iteration (OnePDSI) method, which overcomes the re-convergence and non-expansive divergence present in existing per-sample multi-layer algorithms. Through rigorous convergence analysis of our proposed algorithms, we establish that the worst-case optimality gap in OnePDSI exhibits exponential decay with respect to iteration $K$ at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{R^K})$. Through sensitivity analysis, we derive a threshold for the sampling frequency, beyond which additional sampling does not yield further gains in decision-making. Simulation results validate our analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization decomposition of arbitrary binary-input memoryless channels (BMCs) is studied in this work. By introducing the polarization factor (PF), defined in terms of the conditional entropy of the channel output under various input configurations, we demonstrate that the symmetric capacities of the polarized subchannels can be uniformly expressed as functions of the PF. The explicit formulation of the PF as a function of the block length and subchannel index is derived. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm is proposed for the computation of the PF. Notably, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between each PF and an $n$-ary tree. Leveraging this tree structure, we develop a pruning method to determine the conditional entropy associated with different input relationships. The proposed polarization framework offers both theoretical insights and practical advantages, including intuitive visualization of polarization behavior and efficient polar code construction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables the efficient computation of symmetric capacities for all subchannels in arbitrary BMCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation in High Dimensions: Performance Analysis and Optimal Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has become a powerful framework for estimation under uncertainty, offering strong out-of-sample performance and principled regularization. In this paper, we propose a DRO-based method for linear regression and address a central question: how to optimally choose the robustness radius, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Focusing on high-dimensional settings where the dimension and the number of samples are both large and comparable in size, we employ tools from high-dimensional asymptotic statistics to precisely characterize the estimation error of the resulting estimator. Remarkably, this error can be recovered by solving a simple convex-concave optimization problem involving only four scalar variables. This characterization enables efficient selection of the radius that minimizes the estimation error. In doing so, it achieves the same effect as cross-validation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical experiments confirm that our theoretical predictions closely match empirical performance and that the optimal radius selected through our method aligns with that chosen by cross-validation, highlighting both the accuracy and the practical benefits of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Inverted indexes allow to query large databases without needing to search in the database at each query. An important line of research is to construct the most efficient inverted indexes, both in terms of compression ratio and time efficiency. In this article, we show how to use trit encoding, combined with contextual methods for computing inverted indexes. We perform an extensive study of different variants of these methods and show that our method consistently outperforms the Binary Interpolative Method -- which is one of the golden standards in this topic -- with respect to compression size. We apply our methods to a variety of datasets and make available the source code that produced the results, together with all our datasets.</description>

      <title>Dihedral Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish dihedral quantum codes of short block length, a class of CSS codes obtained by the lifted product construction. We present the code construction and give a formula for the code dimension, depending on the two classical codes that the CSS code is based on. We also give a lower bound on the code distance and construct an example of short dihedral quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</description>

      <title>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</description>
