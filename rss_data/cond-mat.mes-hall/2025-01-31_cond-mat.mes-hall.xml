      <title>Giant orbital Hall effect due to the bulk states of 3D topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.</description>

      <title>Chiral cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Mode-resolved transmission functions: an individual Caroli formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient manipulation of energy at the nanoscale is crucial for advancements in modern computing, energy harvesting, and thermal management. Specifically, controlling quasiparticle currents is critical to these ongoing technological revolutions. This work introduces a novel and physically consistent approach for computing polarization-resolved transmission functions, a crucial element in understanding and controlling energy transport across interfaces. We show that this new method, unlike several previously derived formulations, consistently yields physically meaningful results by addressing the origin of unphysical behavior in other methods. We demonstrate that while multiple decompositions of the transmission function are possible, only there is a unique and unambiguous route to obtaining physically meaningful results. We highlight and critique the arbitrary nature of these alternative decompositions and their associated failures. While developed within the framework of phonon transport, the individual Caroli formula is general and applicable to other fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles, including electrons, and to internal degrees of freedom such as spin and orbital polarization. Through a comparative analysis using a simple model system, we validate the accuracy and reliability of the individual Caroli formula in capturing polarization-specific transmission properties. This new method provides a more accurate understanding of both phonon and electron transport, offering novel ways for optimization of thermoelectric devices and energy-efficient computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators with high intrinsic quality factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to $2\times10^5$ are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.</description>

      <title>Few-Mode and Anisotropic Quantum Transport in InSb Nanoribbons Using an All-van der Waals Material-Based Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality electrostatic gating is a fundamental ingredient for successful semiconducting device physics, and a key element of realizing clean quantum transport. Inspired by the widespread improvement of transport quality when two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials are gated exclusively by other vdW materials, we have developed a method for gating non-vdW materials with an all-vdW gate stack, consisting of a hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer and a few-layer graphite gate electrode. We demonstrate this gating approach on MOVPE-grown InSb nanoribbons (NRs), a novel variant of the InSb nanowire, with a flattened cross-section. In our all-vdW gated NR devices we observe conductance features that are reproducible and have low- to near-zero gate hysteresis. We also report quantized conductance, which persists to lower magnetic fields and longer channel lengths than typical InSb nanowire devices reported to date. Additionally, we observe level splitting that is highly anisotropic in an applied magnetic field, which we attribute to the ribbon cross-section. The performance of our devices is consistent with the reduced disorder expected from the all-vdW gating scheme, and marks the first report of ballistic, few-modes quantum transport in a non-vdW material with an all-vdW gate. Our results establish all-vdW gating as a promising approach for high-quality gating of non-vdW materials for quantum transport, which is in principle applicable generically, beyond InSb systems. In addition, the work showcases the specific potential of all-vdW gate/InSb NR devices for enabling clean quantum devices that may be relevant for spintronics and topological superconductivity studies.</description>

      <title>Competition between excitonic insulators and quantum Hall states in correlated electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter, providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states. Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Topological Hinge States in the Higher-Order Topological Insulator WTe$_2$ Based on the Fractional Josephson Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a novel class of topological materials, characterised by the emergence of topological boundary modes at dimensions two or more lower than those of bulk materials. Recent experimental studies have identified conducting channels at the hinges of HOTIs, although their topological nature remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Shapiro steps in Al-WTe$_2$-Al proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave irradiation and examined the topological properties of the hinge states in WTe$_2$. Specifically, we analysed the microwave frequency dependence of the absence of the first Shapiro step in hinge-dominated JJs, attributing this phenomenon to the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship characteristic of topological JJs. These findings may encourage further research into topological superconductivity with topological hinge states in superconducting hybrid devices based on HOTIs. Such advances could lead to the realisation of Majorana zero modes for topological quantum physics and pave the way for applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer phase coherence and composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) realized in two-dimensional electron systems is explained by the emergent composite fermions (CF) out of ordinary electrons. It is possible to write down explicit wavefunctions explaining many if not all FQHE states. In bilayer systems there is a regime at integer filling of the lowest Landau level that displays a spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) relative phase between the two layers. This can be seen as interlayer phase coherence (ILC) in terms of electrons. Recent experiments in double layer samples of graphene have revealed the appearance of many FQHE states unique to the bilayer case. We discuss extensions of the CF idea in this situation as well as the possible existence of ILC of CFs.</description>

      <title>Large frequency nonreciprocity of azimuthal spin wave modes in submicron vortex state disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex states in thin film disks host spin wave modes that are geometrically quantized according to their radial and azimuthal indices. Previous studies have shown that hybridization between these modes and the vortex core results in a sizeable frequency nonreciprocity between low-order clockwise and counterclockwise propagating azimuthal modes. Here, we present a computational study of these spin wave modes in submicron disks in which the spatial extension of the vortex core becomes comparable to the wavelength of certain modes. In such cases, we find that the frequency nonreciprocity can be large even for higher order radial and azimuthal indices, reaching several GHz and comparable to the mode frequencies themselves.</description>

      <title>Ultra-large mutually synchronized networks of 10 nm spin Hall nano-oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While mutually interacting spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) hold great promise for wireless communication, neural networks, neuromorphic computing, and Ising machines, the highest number of synchronized SHNOs remains limited to $N$ = 64. Using ultra-narrow 10 and 20-nm nano-constrictions in W-Ta/CoFeB/MgO trilayers, we demonstrate mutually synchronized SHNO networks of up to $N$ = 105,000. The microwave power and quality factor scale as $N$ with new record values of 9 nW and $1.04 \times 10^6$, respectively. An unexpectedly strong array size dependence of the frequency-current tunability is explained by magnon exchange between nano-constrictions and magnon losses at the array edges, further corroborated by micromagnetic simulations and Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Our results represent a significant step towards viable SHNO network applications in wireless communication and unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>An extensive thermal conductivity measurement method based on atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport in low-dimensional solids can significantly differ from their bulk counterpart due to various size-related effects. This offers rich heat transport phenomena to emerge. However, finding an appropriate thermometry method for thermal conductivity measurements at the reduced size and dimensionality of the samples is a challenge. Here, we propose and study the feasibility of a nanoscale resolution thermal conductivity measurement method based on bolometric thermometry implemented on an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The local heat exchange between the AFM tip and the sample occurs at a suspended section of the sample, and thermal modeling of the measured electrical resistance change resulting from the bolometric effect provides a unique value for thermal conductivity. As we illustrate via thermal simulations, the proposed method can measure thermal conductivity with thermal disturbance to the sample in as little as 0.2 K at ~20 nm lateral resolution. Our in-depth analysis shows the feasibility and extensive applicability of the proposed AFM-based bolometric thermometry method on low-dimensional materials both in diffusive and ballistic heat transport regimes from cryogenic to above-room temperature. Consequently, the proposed method can lead to a deeper experimental understanding of fundamental questions in nanoscale and low-dimensional heat transport phenomena in many different material classes, as well as Fourier and non-Fourier heat transfer regimes.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Bubble and Skyrmion Lattice Formation in Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation and control of magnetic spin textures is of great interest in fundamental research and future device-oriented applications. Fe/Gd multilayers host a rich variety of magnetic textures including topologically trivial bubbles and topologically protected skyrmions. Using time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy, we highlight how various control strategies, including temperature, out-of-plane magnetic fields and femtosecond light excitation, can be used to create such textures via different pathways. We find that varying the magnetic field for constant temperature leads to a different ($H, T$)-phase diagram of magnetic textures than moving along a temperature trajectory for constant magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate this finding and allow to visualize the different paths taken. Furthermore, we show that the creation of bubbles and skyrmions in this material via impulsive light excitation is not solely governed by temperature-driven processes, since bubbles and skyrmions can be stabilized in parts of the ($H, T$)-phase diagram, where neither the constant temperature nor the constant magnetic field trajectory predict their existence. Using this phase diagram, we reason why bubble and skyrmion creation in this particular system is only possible from the stripe domain state. Our observations provide a versatile toolkit for tailoring the creation of magnetic spin textures in Fe/Gd multilayers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the generation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find that only a small fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies is in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and hidden quantum geometry in charge neutral twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin photocurrents in ultrathin topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films. Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations, we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but have $s$-wave and $d$-wave components in regard to transformations under $\pi/2$ rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on these effects.</description>

      <title>A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations -- which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter -- can lead to observable irreversible decoherence, if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics with Simultaneous Dissipations to Fermionic and Bosonic Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-phenomenological framework based on the influence functional method to incorporate simultaneous interactions of particles with fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs. In the slow-motion limit, the electronic friction kernel becomes Markovian, enabling an analytical expression for the friction coefficient. The framework is applied to a prototypical electrochemical system, where the metal electrode and solvent act as fermionic and bosonic reservoirs, respectively. We investigate quantum vibrational relaxation of hydrogen on metal surfaces, showing that dissipation to electron-hole pairs reduces the relaxation time. Additionally, in solvated proton discharge, electronic friction prolongs charge transfer by delaying proton transitions between potential wells. This study provides new insights into the interplay of solvent and electronic dissipation effects, with direct relevance to electrochemical processes and other systems involving multiple thermal reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Charge state tuning of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <title>Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is showcased.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Dependent Attenuation Factor in Nanographene-Based Molecular Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing molecular nanowires with high electrical conductance that facilitate efficient charge transport over long distances is highly desirable for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, most molecular wires act as tunnel barriers, and their electrical conductance decays exponentially with increasing length. Only recently have a few studies shown increasing conductance with length. In this study, we identify a new class of molecular wires that exhibit both an increase and a decrease in room-temperature conductance with length (a dual attenuation factor), depending on their connection points to the electrodes. We show that this dual attenuation factor is an inherent property of these graphene-like nanowires, and its demonstration depends on the constructive quantum interference pattern for different connectivities to the electrodes. This is significant because a given nanographene molecular wire can show both negative and positive attenuation factors. This enables the systematic design of connectivity-dependent high/low-conductance molecular wires for future molecular-scale circuitry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced double Weyl points, multiband quantum geometry, and singular flat bands of doping-induced states at the Fermi level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two common difficulties in the design of topological quantum materials are that the desired features lie too far from the Fermi level and are spread over a too-large energy range. Doping-induced states at the Fermi level provide a solution, where nontrivial topological properties are enforced by the doping-reduced symmetry. To show this, we consider a regular placement of dopants in a lattice of space group (SG) 176 ($P6\text{}_3/m$), which reduces the symmetry to SG 143 ($P3$). Our two- and four-band models feature double Weyl points, Chern bands, Van Hove singularities, nontrivial multiband quantum geometry due to mixed orbital character, and singular flat bands. We relate these features to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for dopant and vacancy bands of lead apatite Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6$O and Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6($OH$)_2$, the van der Waals ferromagnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, the semiconductor SiC, and the 2D dichalcogenide MoS$_2$.</description>

Abstract: The back-action damping of mechanical motion by electromagnetic radiation is typically overwhelmed by internal loss channels unless demanding experimental ingredients such as superconducting resonators, high-quality optical cavities, or large magnetic fields are employed. Here we demonstrate the first room temperature, cavity-free, all-electric device where back-action damping exceeds internal loss, enabled by a mechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate separation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal and achieves a position imprecision rivaling optical interferometers. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load. This work provides a technologically accessible route to high-precision sensing, transduction, and signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Evaluations of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) have only retained inter-band matrix elements of the position operator. Here we evaluate the OHE including all matrix elements of the position operator, including the technically challenging intra-band elements. We recover previous results and find quantum corrections due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators and inter-band matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum. The quantum corrections dominate the OHE responses of the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs and of massive Dirac fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Land\'e subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.</description>
