      <title>Dust beyond the torus: Revealing the mid-infrared heart of local Seyfert ESO 428-G14 with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar dust has been discovered in a number of local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with radiation-driven torus models predicting a wind to be its main driver. However, little is known about its characteristics, spatial extent, or connection to the larger scale outflows. We present the first JWST/MIRI study aimed at imaging polar dust by zooming onto the heart of ESO 428-G14, part of the GATOS survey of local AGN. We clearly detect extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission within 200 pc from the nucleus. This polar structure is co-linear with a radio jet and lies perpendicular to a molecular gas lane that feeds and obscures the nucleus. The morphology of the MIR structure bears a striking resemblance to that of gas ionised by the AGN in the narrow-line region (NLR). We demonstrate that part of this spatial correspondence is due to contamination within the JWST filter bands from strong emission lines. Correcting for the contamination using ancillary spectroscopy, we find the morphology of the dust continuum to be asymmetric around the nucleus and more compact, though still clearly extended out to r ~ 100 pc. We estimate a temperature of the emitting dust of ~ 120 K. Using simple models, we find that the heating of small dust grains (~ 0.01 microns) by the radiation from the central AGN and/or radiative jet-induced shocks is responsible for the extended MIR emission. Large-grained dust, predicted by models of radiation-driven dusty winds from the torus, is unlikely to be important. This has important implications for scales to which AGN winds can carry dust and dense gas out into their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Satellite group infall into the Milky Way: exploring the Crater-Leo case with new HST proper motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Within $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) simulations, Milky Way-like galaxies accrete some of their satellite galaxies in groups of 3-5 members rather than individually. It was also suggested that this might be the reason behind the origin of satellite planes. Objects accreted in groups are expected to share similar specific total energy and angular momentum, and also identical orbital planes and directions. Aims. Looking at observations of Milky Way satellites, the dwarf galaxies Leo II, IV, V, Crater II, and the star cluster Crater 1 were proposed to be a vestige of group infall. The suggested "Crater-Leo group" shows a coherent distance gradient and all these objects align along a great circle on the sky. We use proper motion data to investigate whether the phase-space distribution of the members of the proposed group are indeed consistent with group infall. Methods. To further investigate this possibility, we use Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proper motions, $(\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_\delta) = (-0.1921 \pm 0.0514, -0.0686 \pm 0.0523)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo IV and $(\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_\delta) = (0.1186 \pm 0.1943, -0.1183 \pm 0.1704)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo V, to derive accurate orbital properties for the proposed group objects. In addition, we explore other possible members of this putative association. Results. Leo II, Leo IV, and Crater 1 show orbital properties consistent with those we predict from assuming group infall. However, our results suggest that Crater II was not accreted with the rest of the objects. If confirmed with increasingly accurate proper motions in the future, the Crater-Leo objects appear to constitute the first identified case of a cosmologically expected, typical group infall event, as opposed to the highly hierarchical Magellanic Cloud system.</description>

      <title>Position dependent radiation fields near accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disk wind models for active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, high-energy radiation poses a significant problem wherein the gas can become overionized, effectively disabling what is often inferred to be the largest force acting on the gas: the radiation force due to spectral line opacity. Calculations of this radiation force depend on the magnitude of ionizing radiation, which can strongly depend on the position above a disk where the radiation is anisotropic. As our first step to quantify the position and direction dependence of the radiation field, we assumed free streaming of photons and computed energy distributions of the mean intensity and components of flux as well as energy-integrated quantities such as mean photon energy. We find a significant dependence of radiation field properties on position, but this dependence is not necessarily the same for different field quantities. A key example is that the mean intensity is much softer than the radial flux at many points near the disk. Because the mean intensity largely controls ionization, this softening decreases the severity of the overionization problem. The position dependence of mean intensity implies the position dependence of gas opacity, which we illustrate by computing the radiation force a fluid element feels in an accelerating wind. We find that in a vertical accelerating flow, the force due to radiation is not parallel to the radiation flux. This misalignment is due to the force's geometric weighting by both the velocity field's directionality and the position dependence of the mean intensity.</description>

      <title>The separate effect of halo mass and stellar mass on the evolution of massive disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a sample of massive disk galaxies selected from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey to investigate how the evolution of these galaxies depends on their stellar and halo masses. We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to the data from different regions in the galaxies to derive several of their key physical properties. From the best-fit model results, together with direct observables such as morphology, colour, and the Mgb/$\langle$Fe$\rangle$ index ratio measured within $1 R_{\rm e}$, we find that for central galaxies both their stellar and halo masses have a significant influence in their evolution. For a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar mass accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than those with smaller stellar mass. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, galaxies living in more massive halos have longer star-formation timescales and are delayed in becoming chemically enriched. In contrast, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mostly determined by their stellar mass. The results indicate that both the assembled halo mass and the halo assembly history impact the evolution of central galaxies. Our spatially resolved analysis indicates that only the galaxy properties in the central region ($0.0$--$0.5 R_{\rm e}$) show the dependencies described above. This fact supports a halo-driven formation scenario since the galaxies' central regions are more likely to contain old stars formed along with the halo itself, keeping a memory of the halo formation process.</description>

      <title>Offset of M54 from the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous modeling of 2D (projected along the line of sight) position, proper motion and line-of-sight velocity for \textit{Gaia}- and APOGEE-observed stars near the centre of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We use a mixture model that allows for independent sub-populations contributed by the Sgr galaxy, its nuclear star cluster M54, and the Milky Way foreground. We find an offset of $0.295\pm 0.029$ degrees between the inferred centroids of Sgr and M54, corresponding to a (projected) physical separation of $0.135\pm 0.013$ kpc. The detected offset might plausibly be driven by unmodelled asymmetry in Sgr's stellar configuration; however, standard criteria for model selection favour our symmetric model over an alternative that allows for bilateral asymmetry. We infer an offset between the proper motion centres of Sgr and M54 of $[\Delta\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta,\Delta\mu_{\delta}]=[4.9, -19.7] \pm [6.8, 6.2]$ $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, with magnitude similar to the covariance expected due to spatially-correlated systematic error. We infer an offset of $4.1\pm 1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity. Using inferred values for the systemic positions and motions of Sgr and M54 as initial conditions, we calculate the recent orbital history of a simplified Sgr/M54 system, which we demonstrate to be sensitive to any line-of-sight distance offset between M54 and Sgr, and to the distribution of dark matter within Sgr.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec High-resolution Spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD at z=10.167: Resolved [OII] Doublet and Electron Density in an Early Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec high-resolution spectroscopy G395H/F290LP of MACS0647-JD, a gravitationally lensed galaxy merger at $z=10.167$. The new spectroscopy, which is acquired for the two lensed images (JD1 and JD2), detects and resolves emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and blue optical, including the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet, [NeIII]3870, [HeI]3890, H$\delta$, H$\gamma$, and [OIII]4363. This is the first observation of the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet for a galaxy at $z&gt;8$. We measure a line flux ratio [OII]3729/3726 $= 0.9 \pm 0.3$, which corresponds to an estimated electron density of $\log(n_{e} / \rm{cm}^{-3}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$. This is significantly higher than the electron densities of local galaxies reported in the literature. We compile the measurements from the literature and further analyze the redshift evolution of $n_{e}$. We find that the redshift evolution follows the power-law form of $n_{e} = A\times (1+z)^{p}$ with $A=54^{+31}_{-23}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $p=1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$. This power-law form may be explained by a combination of metallicity and morphological evolution of galaxies, which become, on average, more metal-poor and more compact with increasing redshift.</description>

      <title>Confronting the Diversity Problem: The Limits of Galaxy Rotation Curves as a tool to Understand Dark Matter Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While galaxy rotation curves provide one of the most powerful methods for measuring dark matter profiles in the inner regions of rotation-supported galaxies, at the dwarf scale there are factors that can complicate this analysis. Given the expectation of a universal profile in dark matter-only simulations, the diversity of observed rotation curves has become an often-discussed issue in Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology on galactic scales. We analyze a suite of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of $10^{10}-10^{12}$ $M_\odot$ halos with standard cold dark matter, and compare the true circular velocity to rotation curve reconstructions. We find that, for galaxies with well-ordered gaseous disks, the measured rotation curve may deviate from true circular velocity by at most 10% within the radius of the disk. However, non-equilibrium behavior, non-circular motions, and non-thermal and non-kinetic stresses may cause much larger discrepancies of 50% or more. Most rotation curve reconstructions underestimate the true circular velocity, while some reconstructions transiently over-estimate it in the central few kiloparsecs due to dynamical phenomena. We further demonstrate that the features that contribute to these failures are not always visibly obvious in HI observations. If such dwarf galaxies are included in galaxy catalogs, they may give rise to the appearance of "artificial" rotation curve diversity that does not reflect the true variation in underlying dark matter profiles.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Interstellar Magnetization by Synchrotron Polarization Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method's applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfv\'enic Mach number of MHD turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of $\mathcal{A} \propto M_{\rm A}^{2}$ between polarization intensity variance $\mathcal{A}$ and Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_{\rm A}$, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) data, achieving Alfv\'enic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alf\'enic turbulence, with $M_{\rm A}$ approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Evolution of radial trends in star formation activity across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using adaptive optics with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI) survey allows us to study the spatially resolved Universe at a crucial time of ~4 Gyr ago ($z$ ~ 0.3) when simulations predict the greatest diversity in evolutionary pathways for galaxies. We investigate the radial trends in the star formation (SF) activity and luminosity-weighted stellar ages as a function of offset from the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for a total of 294 galaxies. Using both H$\alpha$ emission and the 4000 Angstrom break (i.e., D4000) as star formation rate (SFR) tracers, we find overall flat radial profiles for galaxies lying on and above the SFMS, suggestive of physical processes that enhance/regulate SF throughout the entire galaxy disc. However, for galaxies lying below the SFMS, we find positive gradients in SF suggestive of inside-out quenching. Placing our results in context with results from other redshift regimes suggests an evolution in radial trends at $z$ ~ 0.3 for SF galaxies above the SFMS, from uniformly enhanced SF at $z$ ~ 1 and $z$ ~ 0.3 to centrally enhanced SF at $z$ ~ 0 (when averaged over a wide range of mass). We also capture higher local SFRs for galaxies below the SFMS compared to that of $z$ ~ 0, which can be explained by a larger population of quenched satellites in the local Universe and/or different treatments of limitations set by the D4000-sSFR relation.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project -- XIX. Figures of merit for supermassive black hole mass measurements using molecular gas and/or megamaser kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be measured using spatially-resolved kinematics of the region where the SMBH dominates gravitationally. The most reliable measurements are those that resolve the smallest physical scales around the SMBHs. We consider here three metrics to compare the physical scales probed by kinematic tracers dominated by rotation: the radius of the innermost detected kinematic tracer $R_\mathrm{min}$ normalised by respectively the SMBH's Schwarzschild radius ($R_\mathrm{Schw}\equiv 2GM_\mathrm{BH}/c^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ the speed of light), sphere-of-influence (SOI) radius ($R_\mathrm{SOI}\equiv GM_\mathrm{BH}/\sigma_\mathrm{e}^2$, where $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ is the stellar velocity dispersion within the galaxy's effective radius) and equality radius (the radius $R_\mathrm{eq}$ at which the SMBH mass equals the enclosed stellar mass, $M_\mathrm{BH}=M_*(R_\mathrm{eq})$, where $M_*(R)$ is the stellar mass enclosed within the radius $R$). All metrics lead to analogous simple relations between $R_\mathrm{min}$ and the highest circular velocity probed $V_\mathrm{c}$. Adopting these metrics to compare the SMBH mass measurements using molecular gas kinematics to those using megamaser kinematics, we demonstrate that the best molecular gas measurements resolve material that is physically closer to the SMBHs in terms of $R_\mathrm{Schw}$ but is slightly farther in terms of $R_\mathrm{SOI}$ and $R_\mathrm{eq}$. However, molecular gas observations of nearby galaxies using the most extended configurations of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array can resolve the SOI comparably well and thus enable SMBH mass measurements as precise as the best megamaser measurements.</description>

Abstract: Internal kinematics of galaxies, traced through the stellar rotation curve or two dimensional velocity map, carry important information on galactic structure and dark matter. With upcoming surveys, the velocity map may play a key role in the development of kinematic lensing as an astrophysical probe. We improve techniques for extracting velocity information from integral field spectroscopy at low signal-to-noise ($S/N$), without a template, and demonstrate substantial advantages over the standard Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF) approach. We note that Robust rotation curves can be derived down to $S/N\approx 2$ using our method.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Bayesian object classification with a strum of BANNJOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its 12 optical filters, the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) provides an unprecedented multicolor view of the local Universe. The third data release (DR3) covers 3,192 deg$^2$ and contains 47.4 million objects. However, the classification algorithms currently implemented in its pipeline are deterministic and based solely on the sources morphology. Our goal is classify the sources identified in the J-PLUS DR3 images into stars, quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and galaxies. For this task, we present BANNJOS, a machine learning pipeline that uses Bayesian neural networks to provide the probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification. BANNJOS is trained on photometric, astrometric, and morphological data from J-PLUS DR3, Gaia DR3, and CatWISE2020, using over 1.2 million objects with spectroscopic classification from SDSS DR18, LAMOST DR9, DESI EDR, and Gaia DR3. Results are validated using $1.4 10^5$ objects and cross-checked against theoretical model predictions. BANNJOS outperforms all previous classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness across the entire magnitude range. It delivers over 95% accuracy for objects brighter than $r = 21.5$ mag, and ~90% accuracy for those up to $r = 22$ mag, where J-PLUS completeness is &lt; 25%. BANNJOS is also the first object classifier to provide the full probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification, enabling precise object selection for high purity or completeness, and for identifying objects with complex features, like active galactic nuclei with resolved host galaxies. BANNJOS has effectively classified J-PLUS sources into around 20 million galaxies, 1 million QSOs, and 26 million stars, with full PDFs for each, which allow for later refinement of the sample. The upcoming J-PAS survey, with its 56 color bands, will further enhance BANNJOS's ability to detail each source's nature.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances of LINER galaxies -- Nitrogen abundance estimations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in a sample of galaxies with Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs) in their nucleus. Optical spectroscopic data (3 600 - 10 000 {\AA}) of 40 LINERs from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies (MaNGA) survey were considered. Only objects classified as retired galaxies, i.e. whose main ionization sources are post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (pAGB) stars, were selected. The abundance estimates were obtained through detailed photoionization models built with the cloudy code to reproduce a set of observational emission line intensities ratios of the sample. Our results show that LINERs have oxygen and nitrogen abundances in the ranges of $ 8.0 \leq 12+\log(O/H) \leq 9.0$ (mean value $8.74\pm 0.27$) and $7.6 \leq 12+\log(N/H) \leq 8.5$ (mean value $8.05\pm 0.25$), respectively. About 70% of the sample have oversolar O/H and N/H abundances. Our abundance estimates are in consonance with those for Seyfert 2 nuclei and H ii regions with the highest metallicity, indicating that these distinct object classes show similar enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM). The LINERs in our sample are located in the higher N/O region of the N/O versus O/H diagram, showing an expected negative correlation between these two parameters. These results suggest that these LINERs mainly exhibit a secondary nitrogen production and could be acting some other mechanisms that deviate them from the usual theoretical secondary nitrogen production curve and the H ii regions observations. However, we did not find any evidence in our data able to support the literature suggested mechanisms. On the other hand, our results show that LINERs do not present any correlation between the N/O abundances and the stellar masses of the hosting galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extended high-ionization [MgIV] emission tracing widespread shocks in starbursts seen by JWST /NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of extended (&gt;0.5-1kpc) high-ionization [MgIV] 4.487 $\mu$m (80 eV) emission in four local luminous infrared galaxies observed with JWST/NIRSpec. Excluding the nucleus and outflow of the Type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the sample, we find that the [MgIV] luminosity is well correlated with that of H recombination lines, which mainly trace star forming clumps in these objects, and that the [ArVI] 4.530 $\mu$m (75 eV), usually seen in AGN, is undetected. On 100-400pc scales, the [MgIV] line profiles are broader (sigma([MgIV])=90 +- 25 km/s) and shifted (Delta_v up to +- 50 km/s) compared to those of the H recombination lines and lower ionization transitions (e.g., sigma(Hu-12)=57 +- 15 km/s). The [MgIV] kinematics follow the large scale rotating velocity field of these galaxies and the broad [MgIV] profiles are compatible with the broad wings detected in the H recombination lines. Based on these observational results, extended highly ionized gas more turbulent than the ambient interstellar medium, possibly as a result of ionizing shocks associated with star-formation, is the most likely origin of the [MgIV] emission. We also computed new grids of photoionization and shock models to investigate where the [MgIV] line originates. Shocks with velocities of 100-130 km/s reproduce the observed line ratios and the [MgIV] luminosity agrees with that expected from the mechanical energy released by supernove (SNe) in these regions. Therefore, these models support shocks induced by SNe as the origin of the [MgIV] line. Future studies on the stellar feedback from SNe will benefit from the [MgIV] line that is little affected by obscuration and, in absence of an AGN, can only be produced by shocks due to its high ionization potential.</description>

      <title>Calibrating non-parametric morphological indicators from {\it JWST} images for galaxies over $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of morphological indicators of galaxies are often influenced by a series of observational effects. In this study, we utilize a sample of over 800 TNG50 simulated galaxies with log($M_*$/M$_\odot$)$&gt;9$ at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$ to investigate the differences in non-parametric morphological indicators ($C$, $S$, $Gini$, $M_{\rm 20}$, $A_{\rm O}$, and $D_{\rm O}$) derived from noise-free and high-resolution TNG50 images and mock images simulated to have the same observational conditions as {\it JWST}/NIRCam. We quantify the relationship between intrinsic and observed values of the morphological indicators and accordingly apply this calibration to over 4600 galaxies in the same stellar mass and redshift ranges observed in {\it JWST} CEERS and JADES surveys. We find a significant evolution of morphological indicators with rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm rf}$) at $\lambda_{\rm rf}&lt;1$\,$\mu$m, while essentially no obvious variations occur at $\lambda_{\rm rf}&gt;1$\,$\mu$m. The morphological indicators of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) are significantly different. The morphologies of QGs exhibit a higher sensitivity to rest-frame wavelength than SFGs. After analyzing the evolution of morphological indicators in the rest-frame V-band (0.5-0.7\,$\mu$m) and rest-frame J-band (1.1-1.4\,$\mu$m), we find that the morphologies of QGs evolve substantially with both redshift and stellar mass. For SFGs, the $C$, $Gini$ and $M_{\rm 20}$ show a rapid evolution with stellar mass at log($M_*$/M$_\odot$)$\geq10.5$, while the $A_{\rm O}$, $D_{\rm O}$ and $A$ evolve with both redshift and stellar mass. Our comparison shows that TNG50 simulations effectively reproduce the morphological indicators we measured from {\it JWST} observations when the impact of dust attenuation is considered.</description>

      <title>The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.
  I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.</description>

      <title>Unveiling very young O stars. Two Galactic O2V((f*))z in Westerlund 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: O-type stars are known to significantly contribute to both the dynamics and evolution of galaxies. Massive and luminous, they probably control and regulate the galaxies star formation rates. For this work I performed a redetermination of the spectral types and effective temperatures of the Galactic O-type stars MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273. From a careful examination of the spectral features present in the blue optical spectral region, it was possible to identify several nitrogen lines usually only seen in the blue optical spectra of O2-O3 stars. From the nitrogen ionic equivalent width ratios measured in the spectra of MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273, and in those of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, earlier spectral types and hotter effective temperature values were derived. Two O2V, together with three new O3V stars, are now firmly identified in the Westerlund 2 region. Besides RFS1 in NGC3603, the O2 stars found in Westerlund 2 are the only other exemplars known to date in the Milky Way. From the nitrogen equivalent width line ratios measured in the spectra of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, linear relations between the NIV4058-NIII4640 ratio and the effective temperature in the 47000K-51000K range were derived. Based on my spectroscopic analysis of the science targets and the use of a HRD, a mean heliocentric distance of 5kpc to Westerlund 2 was computed, a result that is in line with the mean heliocentric distance of 5.3(1.5) kpc obtained from the associated Gaia DR3 parallaxes and distances. The Westerlund 2 massive stars studied in this work probably share a common evolutionary process that might be representative of the evolutionary ages of a large fraction of the cluster's O-type stellar population, which seems to be much younger than 1 Myrs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By combining aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry of eleven wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using near-infrared (IR) color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-IR color-magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 solar mass, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.</description>

      <title>Rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models as a source of primary nitrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.</description>

      <title>The First Estimation of the Ambipolar Diffusivity Coefficient from Multi-Scale Observations of the Class 0/I Protostar, HOPS-370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protostars are born in magnetized environments. As a consequence, the formation of protostellar disks can be suppressed by the magnetic field efficiently removing angular momentum of the infalling material. Non-ideal MHD effects are proposed to as one way to allow protostellar disks to form. Thus, it is important to understand their contributions in observations of protostellar systems. We derive an analytical equation to estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient at the edge of the protostellar disk in the Class 0/I protostar, HOPS-370, for the first time, under the assumption that the disk radius is set by ambipolar diffusion. Using previous results of the protostellar mass, disk mass, disk radius, density and temperature profiles and magnetic field strength, we estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to be $1.7^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\times10^{19}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$. We quantify the contribution of ambipolar diffusion by estimating its dimensionless Els\"{a}sser number to be $\sim1.7^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$, indicating its dynamical importance in this region. We compare to chemical calculations of the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient using the Non-Ideal magnetohydrodynamics Coefficients and Ionisation Library (NICIL), which is consistent with our results. In addition, we compare our derived ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to the diffusivity coefficients for Ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect, and find ambipolar diffusion is dominant in our density regime. These results demonstrate a new methodology to understand non-ideal MHD effects in observations of protostellar disks. More detailed modeling of the magnetic field, envelope and microphysics, along with a larger sample of protostellar systems is needed to further understand the contributions of non-ideal MHD.</description>

Abstract: OOur current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight to the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (HI) rotational velocity (v=200-280 km s^{-1}) and morphological type (Sab-Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly-resolved HI, our resulting sample is composed of 5 galaxies from the VIVA and THINGS surveys. To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep Spitzer mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m from the S4G survey. Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software 3D-Barolo, we construct RCs and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy\'s gaseous- and stellar-disks mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their rotation curves into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using an MCMC-based approach. Based on the Sun\'s location and the MW\'s R_{25}, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density (\rho=0.21-0.46 GeV cm^{-3}) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW\'s local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.</description>

      <title>RABBITS -- II. The impact of AGN feedback on coalescing supermassive black holes in disc and elliptical galaxy mergers</title>

Abstract: In this study of the `Resolving supermAssive Black hole Binaries In galacTic hydrodynamical Simulations' (RABBITS) series, we investigate the orbital evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) during galaxy mergers. We simulate both disc and elliptical galaxy mergers using the KETJU code, which can simultaneously follow galaxy (hydro-)dynamics and small-scale SMBH dynamics with post-Newtonian corrections. With our SMBH binary subgrid model, we show how active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback affects galaxy properties and SMBH coalescence. We find that simulations without AGN feedback exhibit excessive star formation, resulting in merger remnants that deviate from observed properties. Kinetic AGN feedback proves more effective than thermal AGN feedback in expelling gas from the centre and quenching star formation. The different central galaxy properties, which are a result of distinct AGN feedback models, lead to varying rates of SMBH orbital decay. In the dynamical friction phase, galaxies with higher star formation and higher SMBH masses possess denser centres, become more resistant to tidal stripping, experience greater dynamical friction, and consequently form SMBH binaries earlier. As AGN feedback reduces gas densities in the centres, dynamical friction by stars dominates over gas. In the SMBH hardening phase, compared to elliptical mergers, disc mergers exhibit higher central densities of newly formed stars, resulting in accelerated SMBH hardening and shorter merger time-scales (i.e. $\lesssim 500$ Myr versus $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr). Our findings highlight the importance of AGN feedback and its numerical implementation in understanding the SMBH coalescing process, a key focus for low-frequency gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>MAGICS I. The First Few Orbits Encode the Fate of Seed Massive Black Hole Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elusive massive black hole (MBH) seeds stand to be revealed by the Laser Space Antenna Interferometer through mergers. As an aftermath of galaxy mergers, MBH coalescence is a vastly multi-scale process connected to galaxy formation. We introduce the "Massive black hole Assembly in Galaxies Informed by Cosmological Simulations" (MAGICS) suite, with galaxy/MBH properties and orbits recovered from large-volume cosmological simulation ASTRID. The simulations include subgrid star formation, supernovae feedback, and MBH accretion/feedback. In this first suite, we extract fifteen representative galaxy mergers with seed MBHs to examine their dynamics at an improved mass and spatial resolution (by $\sim2000$ and $\sim20$) and follow MBH orbits down to $\sim10\,\text{pc}$. We find that the seed MBH energy loss and orbital decay are largely governed by global torques induced by the galaxy merger process on scales resolvable by cosmological simulations. Specifically, pairs sink quickly if their orbits shrink rapidly below $1\,\text{kpc}$ during the first $\sim200\,\text{Myr}$ of pairing due to effective energy loss in major galaxy mergers, whereas MBHs gaining energy in minor galaxy mergers with head-on collisions are likely to stall. High initial eccentricities ($e_\text{init}&gt;0.5$) and high stellar densities at kpc scales ($\rho_\text{star}&gt;0.05\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$) also lead to most efficient decays. $\sim50\%$ high-redshift seed MBH pairs experience consecutive galaxy mergers and are more likely to stall at $\sim1\,\text{kpc}$. For a subset of systems, we carry out N-Body re-simulations until binary formation and find that some stalled systems merge at high-z when embedded in sufficient nuclear star clusters.</description>

      <title>CON-quest II. Spatially and spectrally resolved HCN/HCO+ line ratios in local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear regions of ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) are powered by starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These regions are often obscured by extremely high columns of gas and dust. Molecular lines in the submillimeter windows have the potential to determine the physical conditions of these compact obscured nuclei (CONs). We aim to reveal the distributions of HCN and HCO$^+$ emission in local U/LIRGs and investigate whether and how they are related to galaxy properties. Using ALMA, we have conducted sensitive observations of the HCN J=3--2 and HCO$^+$ J=3--2 lines toward 23 U/LIRGs in the local Universe (z &lt; 0.07) with a spatial resolution of ~0.3" (~50--400 pc). We detected both HCN and HCO$^+$ in 21 galaxies, only HCN in one galaxy, and neither in one galaxy. The global HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratios, averaged over scales of ~0.5--4 kpc, range from 0.4 to 2.3, with an unweighted mean of 1.1. These line ratios appear to have no systematic trend with bolometric AGN luminosity or star formation rate. The line ratio varies with position and velocity within each galaxy, with an average interquartile range of 0.38 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. In eight out of ten galaxies known to have outflows and/or inflows, we found spatially and kinematically symmetric structures of high line ratios. These structures appear as a collimated bicone in two galaxies and as a thin spherical shell in six galaxies. Non-LTE analysis suggests that the high HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio in outflows is predominantly influenced by the abundance ratio. Chemical model calculations indicate that the enhancement of HCN abundance in outflows is likely due to high-temperature chemistry triggered by shock heating. These results imply that the HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio can aid in identifying the outflow geometry when the shock velocity of the outflows is sufficiently high to heat the gas.</description>

      <title>NGC1856: Using machine learning techniques to uncover detailed stellar abundances from MUSE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first application of the novel approach based on data-driven machine learning methods applied to Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) field data to derive stellar abundances of star clusters. MUSE has been used to target more than 10,000 fields, and it is unique in its ability to study dense stellar fields such as stellar clusters providing spectra for each individual star. We use MUSE data of the extragalactic young stellar cluster NGC 1856, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present the individual stellar [Fe/H] abundance of 327 cluster members in addition to [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] abundances of subsample sets. Our results match the LMC abundances obtained in the literature for [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe]. This study is the first to derive [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe] abundances for this cluster. The revolutionary combination of integral-field spectroscopy and data-driven modeling will allow us to understand the chemical enrichment of star clusters and their host galaxies in greater detail expanding our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Confirmation of an Ultra-Massive Galaxy in a Protocluster at $z \sim 4.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy (UMG) with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.98 \pm 0.09$ at $z_\mathrm{spec} = 4.8947$ in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), based on deep observations of Ly$\alpha$ emission with Keck/DEIMOS. The ultra-massive galaxy (UMG-28740) is the most massive member in one of the most significant overdensities in the EGS, with four additional photometric members with $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10.5$ within $R_\mathrm{proj} \sim 1$ cMpc. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using a large suite of star formation histories and two sets of high-quality photometry from ground- and space-based facilities consistently estimates the mass of this object to be $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 11$ with a small standard deviation between measurements ($\sigma = 0.09$). While the best-fit SED models agree on stellar mass, we find discrepancies in the estimated star formation rate for UMG-28740, resulting in either a star-forming or quiescent system. $\mathit{JWST}$/NIRCam photometry of UMG-28740 strongly favors a quiescent scenario, demonstrating the need for high-quality mid-IR observations. Assuming the galaxy to be quiescent, UMG-28740 formed the bulk of its stars at $z &gt; 10$ and is quenching at $z \sim 8$, resulting in a high star formation efficiency at high redshift ($\epsilon \sim 0.2$ at $z \sim 5$ and $\epsilon \gtrsim 1$ at $z \gtrsim 8$). As the most massive galaxy in its protocluster environment, UMG-28740 is a unique example of the impossibly early galaxy problem.</description>

      <title>VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) I. High-precision radial velocities of Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This first VELOCE data release comprises 18,225 high-precision RV measurements of 258 bona fide classical Cepheids on both hemispheres collected mainly between 2010 and 2022, alongside 1161 additional observations of 164 other stars. The median per-observation RV uncertainty is 0.037 km/s, and some reach 0.002 km/s. Non-variable standard stars characterize RV zero-point stability and provide a base for future cross-calibrations. We determined zero-point differences between VELOCE and 31 literature data sets using template fitting and measured linear period changes of 146 Cepheids. Seventy six spectroscopic binary Cepheids and 14 candidates are identified using VELOCE data alone and are investigated in detail in a companion paper (VELOCE II). Several new insights into Cepheid pulsations were obtained, including: a) the most detailed description of the Hertzsprung progression by RVs; b) the identification of double-peaked bumps in the RV curve; c) clear evidence that virtually all Cepheids feature spectroscopic variability signals that lead to modulated RV variability. We identified 36 such stars, of which 4 also exhibit orbital motion. Linear radius variations depend strongly on pulsation period and a steep increase in slope of the $\Delta$R/p versus logP-relation is found near 10d, challenging the existence of a tight relation between Baade-Wesselink projection factors and pulsation periods. We investigated the accuracy of RV time series measurements, v$_\gamma$, and RV amplitudes published in Gaia's DR3 and determined an average offset of 0.65 \pm 0.11 km/s relative to VELOCE. We recommend adopting a single set of template correlation parameters for distinct classes of large-amplitude variable stars to avoid systematic offsets in v$_\gamma$ among stars belonging to the same class. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Gaia RVs exhibit significant (16%) dispersion compared to VELOCE. [abridged]</description>
