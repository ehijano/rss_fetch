      <title>Betweenness Centrality Based Dynamic Source Routing for Flying Ad Hoc Networks in Marching Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-performance routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) is challenging due to the diversity of applications and the dynamics of network topology. The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc networks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal importance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are unsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we propose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol for a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we introduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the leader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial correlations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we exploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural unequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the particular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated relying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation results demonstrate that our BCDSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery ratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than representative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a reasonably small network jitter.</description>

      <title>Rotatable RIS-Assisted Edge Computing: Orientation, Task Offloading, and Resource Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can enhance mobile edge computing (MEC) performance by optimizing its orientation to improve the gain of received and transmitted signals. This correspondence investigates a rotatable RIS-assisted MEC system, aimed at minimizing energy consumption for multiple moving user equipment (UEs) through the joint design of RIS orientation, discrete phase shift, computation resource allocation, transmitting power and task offloading strategies. Considering the mobility of UEs, this problem is formulated as a sequential decision-making across multiple time slots. To address this challenge, a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize RIS orientation, phase shift and task offloading strategies, while computation resource allocation and transmitting power are determined based on the actions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits superior convergence and performance compared to benchmarks. Additionally, the rotatable RIS scheme reduces total energy consumption by up to 47.3% compared to the fixed RIS, enhancing MEC system performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate beamforming design and trajectory optimization for a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</description>

      <title>Governance of Ledger-Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Decentralized Identifier (DID) empowers an entity to prove control over a unique and self-issued identifier without relying on any identity provider. The public key material for the proof is encoded into an associated DID document (DDO). This is preferable shared via a distributed ledger because it guarantees algorithmically that everyone has access to the latest state of any tamper-proof DDO but only the entities in control of a DID are able to update theirs. Yet, it is possible to grant deputies the authority to update the DDO on behalf of the DID owner. However, the DID specification leaves largely open on how authorizations over a DDO are managed and enforced among multiple deputies. This article investigates what it means to govern a DID and discusses various forms of how a DID can be controlled by potentially more than one entity. It also presents a prototype of a DID-conform identifier management system where a selected set of governance policies are deployed as Smart Contracts. The article highlights the critical role of governance for the trustworthy and flexible deployment of ledger-anchored DIDs across various domains.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for EDFA Gain Modeling: A Semi-Supervised Approach Using Internal Amplifier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain spectrum of an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) has a complex dependence on channel loading, pump power, and operating mode, making accurate modeling difficult to achieve. Machine Learning (ML) based modeling methods can achieve high accuracy, but they require comprehensive data collection. We present a novel ML-based Semi-Supervised, Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) framework to model the wavelength dependent gain of EDFAs using minimal data, which achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.07/0.08 dB for booster/pre-amplifier gain prediction. We further perform Transfer Learning (TL) using a single additional measurement per target-gain setting to transfer this model among 22 EDFAs in Open Ireland and COSMOS testbeds, which achieves a MAE of less than 0.19 dB even when operated across different amplifier types. We show that the SS-NN model achieves high accuracy for gain spectrum prediction with minimal data requirement when compared with current benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Commercial Dishes Can Be My Ladder: Sustainable and Collaborative Data Offloading in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, characterized by their high data throughput and low latency, have gained significant interest from both industry and academia. Routing data efficiently within these networks is essential for maintaining a high quality of service. However, current routing strategies, such as bent-pipe and inter-satellite link (ISL) routing, have their unique challenges. The bent-pipe strategy requires a dense deployment of dedicated ground stations, while the ISL-based strategy can negatively impact satellite battery lifespan due to increased traffic load, leading to sustainability issues.
  In this paper, we propose sustainable collaborative offloading, a framework that orchestrates groups of existing commercial resources like ground stations and 5G base stations for data offloading. This orchestration enhances total capacity, overcoming the limitations of a single resource. We propose the collaborator group set construction algorithm to construct candidate groups and the collaborator selection and total payment algorithm to select offloading targets and determine payments no less than the costs. Extensive real-world-based simulations show that our solution significantly improves energy consumption, satellite service life, and end-to-end latency.</description>

      <title>Ordered Topological Deep Learning: a Network Modeling Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer networks are the foundation of modern digital infrastructure, facilitating global communication and data exchange. As demand for reliable high-bandwidth connectivity grows, advanced network modeling techniques become increasingly essential to optimize performance and predict network behavior. Traditional modeling methods, such as packet-level simulators and queueing theory, have notable limitations --either being computationally expensive or relying on restrictive assumptions that reduce accuracy. In this context, the deep learning-based RouteNet family of models has recently redefined network modeling by showing an unprecedented cost-performance trade-off. In this work, we revisit RouteNet's sophisticated design and uncover its hidden connection to Topological Deep Learning (TDL), an emerging field that models higher-order interactions beyond standard graph-based methods. We demonstrate that, although originally formulated as a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, RouteNet serves as the first instantiation of a new form of TDL. More specifically, this paper presents OrdGCCN, a novel TDL framework that introduces the notion of ordered neighbors in arbitrary discrete topological spaces, and shows that RouteNet's architecture can be naturally described as an ordered topological neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful real-world application of state-of-the-art TDL principles --which we confirm through extensive testbed experiments--, laying the foundation for the next generation of ordered TDL-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Representation for Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction: A 3D Gaussian Splatting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a long-standing challenge. This issue has been escalated due to denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and broader bandwidth in next-generation networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency signal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these limitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates electromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages deformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF, significantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In addition, WRF-GS+ enhances the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS modeling process and improving computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that both WRF-GS and WRF-GS+ outperform baselines for spatial spectrum synthesis, including ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Notably, WRF-GS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) prediction tasks, surpassing existing methods by more than 0.7 dB and 3.36 dB, respectively.</description>

      <title>Packet Level Resilience for the User Plane in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demands of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G networks necessitate enhanced resilience mechanisms to address user plane failures caused by outages, hardware defects, or software bugs. An important aspect for achieving ultra-reliable communication is the redundant transmission of packets, as also highlighted in 3GPP Release 18. This paper explores leveraging the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Function (PREOF) to achieve 1+1 path protection within private 5G environments. By extending existing 5G components with mechanisms for packet level redundancy and offloading the reordering mechanism to external servers, the proposed approach ensures minimal packet loss in case of a failure. A conceptual integration of redundant paths and programmable elements is presented, with considerations for deployment in existing 5G infrastructures and the trade-offs of latency versus enhanced traffic engineering. Future work aims to evaluate practical implementations using an open source 5G core, P4-based hardware and offloading technologies like DPDK and eBPF.</description>

      <title>The Future of IPTV: Security, AI Integration, 5G, and Next-Gen Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has transformed the landscape of digital broadcasting by leveraging high-speed internet connectivity to deliver high-quality multimedia content. IPTV provides a dynamic and interactive television experience through managed networks, ensuring superior Quality of Service (QoS) compared to open-network Internet TV. This study explores the technical infrastructure of IPTV, including its network architecture, data compression techniques, and the role of protocols such as IGMP and RTSP. It also examines security challenges, including encryption, digital rights management (DRM), and authentication mechanisms that safeguard IPTV services from unauthorized access and piracy. Moreover, the paper analyzes the distinctions between IPTV and open-network Internet TV, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations in terms of service control, bandwidth optimization, and content security. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in IPTV enhances personalized content recommendations and predictive analytics, leading to improved user engagement and efficient network management. Additionally, emerging technologies such as 5G and cloud-based IPTV services are explored for their potential to further revolutionize the industry. While IPTV presents a robust alternative to traditional broadcasting, challenges such as bandwidth constraints, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance remain significant. The study concludes that IPTV's future success will depend on advancements in network infrastructure, AI-driven optimizations, and strategic regulatory adaptations. As IPTV continues to evolve, hybrid models integrating IPTV and open-network streaming services are expected to enhance content accessibility, security, and overall user experience.</description>

      <title>Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</description>
