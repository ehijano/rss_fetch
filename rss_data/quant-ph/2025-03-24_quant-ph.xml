      <title>Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA outperforms the method of cumulant expansion in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and broad applicability. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on determination of photon number statistics from measurements with multiplexed on/off detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fundamental bounds on the ability to determine photon number distribution and other related quantities from tomographically incomplete measurements with an array of M detectors that can only distinguish the absence or presence of photons. We show that the lower and upper bounds on photon number probabilities can be determined by solving a linear program. We present and discuss numerical results for various input states including thermal states, coherent states, squeezed states, and highly non-classical single-photon subtracted squeezed vacuum states. Besides photon number probabilities we also investigate bounds on the parity of photon number distribution which determines the value of Wigner function of the state at the origin of phase space. Moreover, we also discuss estimation of mean photon number as an example of a quantity described by an unbounded operator. Our approach and results can provide quantitative guidance on the number of detection channels required to determine the photon number distribution with a given precision.</description>

      <title>A Closed Form for Moment-Based Entanglement Tests Associated to the PPT Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neven et al. have explored an unexpected alliance between the mathematical insights of Sir Isaac Newton and Ren\'e Descartes which culminates in the reduction of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) criterion to an equivalent hierarchy of entanglement tests based on the moments of the partial transpose. By repurposing these classical results in the context of modern quantum theory, they illuminate new pathways for entanglement verification. Here, we expand on this work by providing a closed form for the inequalities defining these entanglement tests and producing an equivalent set of graph theoretic conditions on the weighted graph induced by the partial transpose.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation based on Open Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Quantum Walks (OQW) are a type of quantum walk governed by the system's interaction with its environment. We explore the time evolution and the limit behavior of the OQW framework for Quantum Computation and show how we can represent random unitary quantum channels, such as the dephasing and depolarizing channels in this model. We also developed a simulation protocol with circuit representation for this model, which is heavily inspired by the fact that graphs represent OQW and are, thereby, local (in the graph sense). We obtain asymptotic advantages in system dimension, depth, and CNOT count compared to other simulation methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian non-Abelian topological transition in the S=1 electron spin system of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases and transitions are of fundamental importance in physics, which provide a deep insight into the understanding of materials. Recently, non-Abelian topological transitions have been investigated in Hermitian systems, revealing important topological features. With non-Hermiticity introduced, non-Hermitian non-Abelian topological transitions bring about more intriguing topological features, yet has not been experimentally explored. In this work, we report the observation of the non-Hermitian non-Abelian topological transition at the atomic scale utilizing a nitrogenvacancy center in diamond. While the well-established topological numbers, failed to recognize this transition, we successfully characterized such a transition with the measurement of the complex eigenvalue braids. We obtained the braid invariants from the measured relative phases between eigenvalues. The observed change in braid invariants provides a clear signature of the non-Abelian topological transition. Furthermore, we experimentally revealed an intriguing consequence of this transition, which is the creation of a third-order exceptional point through the collision of two second-order exceptional points with opposite charges. Our experimental findings shed light on the abundant non-Abelian topological phenomena involving non-Hermiticity, and provide insights into manipulating the spectral topology in atomic scale systems to achieve exotic functionalities arising from non-Abelian band braiding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings model with degenerate atomic levels and polarization-degenerate field mode is considered. The general expression for the system evolution operator is derived. The analytical expressions for such operators in the case of low values ($J \leq 3/2$) of atomic angular momentum are obtained. The polarization properties of the photon emitted into the cavity by an excited atom are studied with an account of relaxation processes for arbitrary angular momenta of atomic levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a two level $P\sigma_{z}$ pseudo-Hermitian system in contact with a thermal bath to study various thermodynamic properties. The system is realized in terms of infinitely many invariant subspaces. We find explicit solution in each subspace analytically. The quantum system undergoes a $P\sigma_{z}$ phase transition in each invariant subspace, when the non-Hermitian coupling exceeds a certain critical value ($\mu_c$). We calculate various thermodynamic quantities and observe that these quantities show divergences exactly at the exceptional points (EPs) of the theory.</description>

      <title>Free-Space Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) elevates the secure key rate from a linear to a square-root dependence on channel loss while preserving measurement-device-independent security. This protocol is uniquely positioned to enable global-scale quantum networks, even under extreme channel loss. While fiber-based TF-QKD implementations have advanced rapidly since its proposal, free-space realizations have remained elusive due to atmospheric turbulence-induced phase distortions. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of free-space TF-QKD over 14.2 km urban atmospheric channels, surpassing the effective atmospheric thickness -- a critical threshold for satellite compatibility. We achieve a secret key rate exceeding the repeaterless capacity bound, a milestone for practical quantum communication. Our approach eliminates the need for an auxiliary channel to stabilize a closed interferometer, instead leveraging open-channel time and phase control of optical pulses. This work represents a pivotal advance toward satellite-based global quantum networks, combining high-speed key distribution with inherent resistance to real-world channel fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Error Correction with 1D Log-Depth Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and high-performance quantum error correction is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Low-depth random circuits offer a promising approach to identifying effective and practical encoding strategies. In this work, we construct quantum error-correcting codes based on one-dimensional, logarithmic-depth random Clifford encoding circuits with a two-layer circuit structure. We demonstrate that these random codes typically exhibit good approximate quantum error correction capability by proving that their encoding rate achieves the hashing bound for Pauli noise and the channel capacity for erasure errors. Moreover, we show that the error correction inaccuracy decays exponentially with circuit depth, resulting in negligible errors for these logarithmic-depth circuits. We also establish that these codes are optimal, proving that logarithmic depth is necessary to maintain a constant encoding rate and high error correction performance. To prove our results, we propose new decoupling theorems for one-dimensional, low-depth circuits. These results also imply the strong decoupling and rapid thermalization within low-depth random circuits and have potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>A quantum gradient descent algorithm for optimizing Gaussian Process models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a nonparametric supervised learning method, widely valued for its ability to quantify uncertainty. Despite its advantages and broad applications, classical GPR implementations face significant scalability challenges, as they involve matrix operations with a cubic complexity in relation to the dataset size. This computational challenge is further compounded by the demand of optimizing the Gaussian Process model over its hyperparameters, rendering the total computational cost prohibitive for data intensive problems. To address this issue, we propose a quantum gradient descent algorithm to optimize the Gaussian Process model. Taking advantage of recent advances in quantum algorithms for linear algebra, our algorithm achieves exponential speedup in computing the gradients of the log marginal likelihood. The entire gradient descent process is integrated into the quantum circuit. Through runtime analysis and error bounds, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the scalability of GPR model optimization, making it computationally feasible for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of randomized quantum algorithms with dynamic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms are crucial subroutines in quantum computing, but the requirement to execute many types of circuits on a real quantum device has been challenging to their extensive implementation. In this study, we propose an engineering method to reduce the executing time for randomized algorithms using dynamic circuits, i.e., quantum circuits involving intermediate measurement and feedback processes. The main idea is to generate the probability distribution defining a target randomized algorithm on a quantum computer, instead of a classical computer, which enables us to implement a variety of static circuits on a single dynamic circuit with many measurements. We applied the proposed method to the task of random Pauli measurement for one qubit on an IBM superconducting device, showing that a 14,000-fold acceleration of executing time was observed compared with a conventional method using static circuits. Additionally, for the problem of estimating expectation values of 28- and 40-qubit hydrogen chain models, we successfully applied the proposed method to realize the classical shadow with 10 million random circuits, which is the largest demonstration of classical shadow. This work significantly simplifies the execution of randomized algorithms on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Feedback-enhanced quantum reservoir computing with weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) leverages the natural dynamics of quantum systems to process time-series data efficiently, offering a promising approach for near-term quantum devices. Unlike classical reservoir computing, the efficacy of feedback in QRC has not yet been thoroughly explored. Here, we develop a feedback-enhanced QRC framework with weak measurements. Weak measurements preserve information stored in quantum coherence, while feedback enhances nonlinearity and memory capacity. The implementation of our framework assumes an ensemble quantum system, such as nuclear magnetic resonance. Through linear memory and nonlinear forecasting tasks, we show that our model outperforms conventional QRC approaches in many cases. Our proposed protocol achieves superior performance in systems with small measurement errors and low environmental noise. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that feedback of measurement results reinforces the nonlinearity of the reservoir. These findings highlight the potential of feedback-enhanced QRC for next-generation quantum machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuously growing effort towards developing real-world quantum technological applications has come to demand an increasing amount of flexibility from its respective platforms. This review presents a highly adaptable engineering technique for photonic quantum technologies based on the artificial structuring of the material nonlinearity. This technique, while, in a simple form, already featured across the full breadth of photonic quantum technologies, has undergone significant development over the last decade, now featuring advanced, aperiodic designs. This review gives an introduction to the three-wave-mixing processes lying at the core of this approach, and illustrates, on basis of the underlying quantum-mechanical description, how they can artificially be manipulated to engineer the corresponding photon characteristics. It then describes how this technique can be employed to realize a number of very different objectives which are expected to find application across the full range of photonic quantum technologies, and presents a summary of the research done towards these ends to date.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random numbers are essential for security against quantum algorithms. Randomness as a beacon is a service being provided for companies and governments to upgrade their security standards from RSA to PQC - QKD or PQC-RSA protocols. Both security mechanisms assume trust in the service provider unless one aims for device-independent protocols. How does an entity ensure that the beacon service has a quantum signature other than relying on faith? Specifically, given a bit-stream, can a user verify a quantum signature in it? Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods. These include the NIST statistical test suite and machine learning algorithms that strengthen the theorem. This work is relevant for companies and governments using QRNG OpenAPI to enhance security against quantum threats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided phonons have become an increasingly important platform for classical and quantum information processing. While conventional surface acoustic wave systems are typically only guided in the vertical direction, two-dimensionally confined waveguide systems offer significant advantages in terms of density of phononic circuit components and much higher intensities of strain and piezoelectric fields, which make them promising candidates for advancing acoustoelectric and quantum phononic applications. One such material system for generating and guiding phonons at gigahertz frequencies is AlScN on SiC, which can be synthesized by sputter depositing AlScN directly onto SiC wafers. The AlScN on SiC platform allows for tightly vertically confined acoustic modes with high electromechanical coupling, high speed of sound, and simple fabrication of strip and rib waveguides. Until now, this system has only been studied as a slab waveguide platform, i.e., without any lateral waveguiding. Here, we present a 2D-confined phononic waveguide architecture in AlScN on SiC with strongly electromechanically coupled modes that could serve as a platform for phononic routing, power-efficient active and nonlinear phononic devices such as amplifiers, mixers, and oscillators, as well as for interacting with quantum systems such as vacancy centers, charge carriers, photons, and spins. We study two distinct gigahertz frequency waveguide mode families using impedance matched interdigital transducers and characterize their electromechanical coupling and propagation losses. Additionally, we analyze how these waveguides could interact with various important quantum and classical systems that can be either embedded in SiC or heterogeneously integrated on the surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from negativity of work quasiprobability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' if there is a large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of phase and uncorrelated dephasing in a differential quantum interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements in optical and atomic systems often rely on differential interferometry. This method allows to handle large and correlated phase noise contributions -- such as environmental vibrations, thermal fluctuations, or instrumental drifts -- preventing them from blurring the signal. To date, this approach has primarily focused on extracting the differential phase shift. However, valuable information about the system is also contained in the width of uncorrelated phase fluctuations. In this work, we present a maximum likelihood approach for the simultaneous estimation of both the differential phase shift and the width of uncorrelated phase noise. Unlike conventional methods, our technique explicitly accounts for the data spreading and outperforms traditional ellipse fitting in terms of both precision and accuracy. We demonstrate our methodology using a quantum mechanical model of coupled interferometers, where uncorrelated dephasing arises from projection noise and interparticle interactions. Our results establish a novel approach to data analysis in differential interferometry that is readily applicable to current experiments.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine, which coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>

      <title>Blockwise Optimization for Projective Variational Quantum Dynamics (BLOP-VQD): Algorithm and Implementation for Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient approach to simulate real-time quantum dynamics using Projected Variational Quantum Dynamics (PVQD), where the computational cost is reduced by strategically optimizing only a subset of the variational parameters at each time step. Typically, the variational ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost. This new optimization strategy provides a promising path toward high-fidelity simulation of the time evolution of complex quantum systems with reduced computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analytical models for realistic photonic quantum teleportation experiments with time-bin qubits, utilizing phase space methods from quantum optics. These models yield analytical expressions for Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibilities and qubit fidelities, accounting for imperfections such as loss, photon distinguishability, and unwanted multi-photon events in single and entangled photon sources. Our expressions agree with the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibilities and teleportation fidelities reported by Valivarthi et al. (PRX Quantum 1, 020317, 2020). We use these models to predict and analyze the outcomes of future teleportation experiments under varying degrees of imperfections.</description>

      <title>Fourier State Tomography of Polarization-Encoded Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a central technique for the characterization and verification of quantum systems. Standard tomography is widely used for low-dimensional systems, but for larger systems, it becomes impractical due to the exponential scaling of experimental complexity with the number of qubits. Here, we present an experimental realization of Fourier-transform quantum state tomography for polarization-encoded photonic states. We validate the technique using weak coherent states and entangled photon pairs generated by a quantum dot and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom wavelength. The reconstructed density matrices show excellent agreement with those obtained through conventional projective tomography, with calculated metrics such as fidelity and concurrence matching within error bars, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the technique. Fourier state tomography employs only a single rotating waveplate per qubit, thereby avoiding repeated adjustments across multiple waveplates and ensuring that the number of physical measurement settings scales linearly with the number of qubits, despite the exponential growth of the underlying state space. This reduction in optical configurations simplifies experimental overhead, making Fourier state tomography a practical alternative for multi-qubit characterization.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Software Co-design for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) offers a pathway for scaling up quantum computing architectures beyond the confines of a single chip. Entanglement is a crucial resource for implementing non-local operations in DQC, and it is required to allow teleportation of quantum states and gates. Remote entanglement generation in practical systems is probabilistic, has longer duration than that of local operations, and is nondeterministic. Therefore, optimizing the performance of probabilistic remote entanglement generation is critically important for the performance of DQC architectures. In this paper we propose and study a new DQC architecture that combines (1) buffering of successfully generated entanglement, (2) asynchronously attempted entanglement generation, and (3) adaptive scheduling of remote gates based on the entanglement generation pattern. We show that our hardware-software co-design improves both the runtime and the output fidelity under a realistic model of DQC.</description>

      <title>Scheme of quantum communications based on Witting polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, generalizations of quantum communication protocols from qubits to systems with higher-dimensional state spaces (qudits) typically use mutually unbiased bases (MUB). The construction with maximal number of MUB is known in any dimension equal to a prime power and at least two such bases exist in any dimension. However, in small dimensions, there also exist formally more symmetric systems of states, described by regular complex polytopes, which are a generalization of the idea of Platonic solids to complex spaces.
  This work considers the application of a model originally proposed by R. Penrose and based on the geometry of dodecahedron and two entangled particles with spin 3/2. In a more general case, two arbitrary quantum systems with four basis states (ququarts) can be used instead. It was later shown that this system with 40 states is equivalent to the Witting configuration and is related to the four-dimensional complex polytope described by Coxeter. Presented paper describes how to use this configuration for a quantum key distribution protocol based on contextuality using some illustrative examples with 40 "quantum cards".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically computed Floquet states of a Bose-Hubbard dimer which is subjected to strong, time-periodic forcing with respect to their coherence, invoking a measure for their degree of simplicity previously suggested by Leggett. This serves to ascertain the validity of the mean-field approximation under conditions such that the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation has chaotic solutions. It is shown that for sufficiently large particle numbers the exact N-particle Floquet state semiclassically associated with the innermost quantized invariant tube surrounding a stable periodic mean-field orbit represents a macroscopically occupied single-particle state, i.e., a Floquet condensate.</description>

      <title>First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on $\mathbb{RP}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing high-fidelity logical magic states is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among prior attempts to reduce the substantial cost of magic state preparation, magic state cultivation (MSC), a recently proposed protocol for preparing $\mathrm{T}$ states without magic state distillation, achieves state-of-the-art efficiency. Inspired by this work, we propose a new MSC procedure that would produce a logical $\mathrm{T}$ state on a rotated surface code at a further reduced cost. For our MSC protocol, we define a new code family, the $\mathbb {RP}^2$ code, by putting the rotated surface code on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ (a two-dimensional manifold), as well as two self-dual CSS codes named SRP-3 and SRP-5 respectively. Small $\mathbb{RP}^2$ codes are used to hold logical information and checked by syndrome extraction (SE) circuits. We design fast morphing circuits that enable switching between a distance 3 (5) $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code and an SRP-3 (SRP-5) code on which we can efficiently check the correctness of the logical state. To preserve the high accuracy of the cultivated logical $\mathrm{T}$ state, we design an efficient and easy-to-decode expansion stage that grows a small $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code to a large rotated surface code in one round. Our MSC protocol utilizes non-local connectivity, available on both neutral atom array and ion trap platforms. According to our Monte Carlo sampling results, our MSC protocol requires about an order of magnitude smaller space-time volume to reach a target logical error rate around $10^{-9}$ compared to the original MSC protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a fundamental resource for quantum computation, enabling quantum algorithms to surpass classical capabilities. Despite its importance, characterizing magic remains challenging due to the intricate geometry of stabilizer polytopes and the difficulty of simulating non-stabilizer states. In this work, we reveal an unexpected connection between magic and Bell inequalities. Although maximally entangled stabilizer states can violate Bell inequalities and magic is deeply tied to the algebraic structure of observables, we show that tailored Bell inequalities can act as witnesses of magic. This result bridges two key quantum resources, uncovering a novel relationship between the device-independent framework and resource-theoretic properties of quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in classical reversible computing, Quantum Arithmetic is typically seen as a set of tools that process binary data encoded into a quantum register to set the value of another quantum register. This article presents another approach to explain the Quantum Arithmetic in quantum computing. Here, Quantum Arithmetic is addressed with a matrix processing point of view. Quantum Arithmetic is a convenient way to construct the Query that implements the mathematical problem of interest. This approach is not only an interpretation with the matrix approach to encode the problem of interest; it also allows us to derive a new original technique to construct Quantum Arithmetic with the framework of embedded Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). This work uses the link between the eigenstate amplitude and the operator phase to transform the QSP processed amplitude into binary value extracted by Quantum Phase Estimation(QPE). The explanations allowing the QSP based Quantum Arithmetic construction let appear natively sub-routines and functions used by well-known algorithms such as Ancilla Quantum Encoding (AQE)'s Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm (HHL) and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). Methods to implement this circuit are presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical quantum bus for donor spins in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a quantum bus between two driven qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of driven qubits coupled to a harmonic oscillator to implement a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$-gate. By dressing the qubits through an external driving field, the qubits and the harmonic oscillator can be selectively coupled, leading to effective qubit-qubit interactions. We analyze a qubit readout mechanism based on the detection of a shift of the harmonic oscillator's resonance frequency, and demonstrate that when coupled to low-frequency resonators, dressed qubits provide a more robust readout than bare qubits in the presence of damping and thermal effects. Furthermore, we study the impact of various system parameters on the fidelity of the two qubit-gate, identifying an optimal range for quantum computation. Our findings guide the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in experimental setups, for example those employing nanoscale mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>(FAPP) Infinity Does Macroscopic Irreversibility From Microscopic Reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinity is central to deriving macroscopic irreversibility from reversible microscopic laws across mathematics, theoretical computer science and physics. In analysis, infinite processes -- such as Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences -- construct real numbers as equivalence classes of rational approximations, bridging discrete rationals to the continuous real line. In quantum mechanics, infinite tensor products model nested measurements, where sectorization partitions the Hilbert space into equivalence classes, reconciling unitary evolution with wavefunction collapse. In statistical mechanics, macrostates emerge as equivalence classes of microstates sharing identical macroscopic properties, providing the statistical basis for thermodynamic irreversibility despite reversible dynamics. Equivalence relations formalize For-All-Practical-Purposes (FAPP) indistinguishability, reflecting operational limits on precision and observation. Together, these examples reveal a unified framework where infinity and equivalence underpin emergent macroscopic behavior from microscopic reversibility.</description>

      <title>Isoenergetic model for optical downconversion and error-specific limits of the parametric approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical downconversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a non-depleted and non-entangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schr\"odinger equation of the downconversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. The new model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 1.8$ and a coherent pump amplitude of $\alpha\approx 2\cdot10^6$, can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of $\alpha \approx 2\cdot10^6$, the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds $r\approx 4.5$, whereas the new approximation remains valid up to $r\approx 6$ with an acceptable error of 1%.</description>

      <title>Hardware-level Interfaces for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology of Quantum Computing (QC) is continuously evolving, as researchers explore new technologies and the public gains access to quantum computers with an increasing number of qubits. In addition, the research community and industry are increasingly interested in the potential use, application, and contribution of QCs to large-scale problems in the real world as a result of this technological enhancement. QCs operations are based on quantum mechanics, and their special properties are mainly exploited to solve computationally intensive problems in polynomial time, problems that are commonly unsolvable, even by High-Performance Computing systems (HPCs) in a feasible time. However, since QCs cannot perform as general-purpose computing machines, alternative computational approaches aiming to boost further their enormous computing abilities are requested, and their combination as an additional computing resource to HPC systems is considered as one of the most promising ones. In the proposed hybrid HPCs, the Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), similar to GPUs and CPUs, target specific problems that, through Quantum Algorithms, can exploit quantum properties like quantum entanglement and superposition to achieve substantial performance gains from the HPC point of view. This interconnection between classical HPC systems and QCs towards the creation of Hybrid Quantum-Classical computing systems is neither straightforward nor standardized while crucial for unlocking the real potential of QCs and achieving real performance improvements. The interconnection between the classical and quantum systems can be performed in the hardware, software (system), or application layer. In this study, a concise overview of the existing architectures for the interconnection interface between HPCs and QCs is provided, focusing on hardware approaches that enable effective hybrid quantum-classical operation.</description>

      <title>Public-Key Quantum Money and Fast Real Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a public-key quantum money scheme based on group actions and the Hartley transform. Our scheme adapts the quantum money scheme of Zhandry (2024), replacing the Fourier transform with the Hartley transform. This substitution ensures the banknotes have real amplitudes rather than complex amplitudes, which could offer both computational and theoretical advantages.
  To support this new construction, we propose a new verification algorithm that uses group action twists to address verification failures caused by the switch to real amplitudes. We also show how to efficiently compute the serial number associated with a money state using a new algorithm based on continuous-time quantum walks. Finally, we present a recursive algorithm for the quantum Hartley transform, achieving lower gate complexity than prior work and demonstrate how to compute other real quantum transforms, such as the quantum sine transform, using the quantum Hartley transform as a subroutine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate conditional entanglement swapping, i.e. teleportation of entanglement, between time-bin qubits at the telecommunication wavelength of 1536.4 nm with high fidelity of 87\%. Our system is deployable, utilizing modular, off-the-shelf, fiber-coupled, and electrically controlled components such as electro-optic modulators. It leverages the precise timing resolution of superconducting nanowire detectors, which are controlled and read out via a custom developed graphical user interface. The swapping process is described, interpreted, and guided using characteristic function-based analytical modeling that accounts for realistic imperfections. Our system supports quantum networking protocols, including source-independent quantum key distribution, with an estimated secret key rate of approximately 0.5 bits per sifted bit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Memory Enhanced Multipoint Correlation Spectroscopy for Statistically Polarized NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with solid-state spin sensors is a promising pathway for the detection of nuclear spins at the micro- and nanoscale. Although many nanoscale experiments rely on a single sensor spin for the detection of the signal, leveraging spin ensembles can enhance sensitivity, particularly in cases in which the signal merely originates from statistically polarized nuclear spins. In this work, we introduce multipoint correlation spectroscopy, that combines the advantages of two well-established methods -- correlation spectroscopy and quantum heterodyne detection -- to enable temporally efficient measurements of statistically polarized samples at the nanoscale with spin ensembles. We present a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate an experimental proof of concept with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We achieve single hertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency, highlighting the potential applications of the technique for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Fermionic circuits using Majorana Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</description>

      <title>Almost device-independent calibration beyond Born's rule: Bell tests for cross-talk detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information, device-independent protocols offer a new approach to information processing tasks, making minimal assumptions about the devices used. Typically, since these protocols draw conclusions directly from the data collected in a meaningful Bell test, the no-signaling conditions, and often even Born's rule for local measurements, are taken as premises of the protocol. Here, we demonstrate how to test such premises in an (almost) device-independent setting, i.e., directly from the raw data and with minimal assumptions. In particular, for IBM's quantum computing cloud services, we implement the prediction-based ratio protocol to characterize how well the qubits can be accessed locally and independently. More precisely, by performing a variety of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type experiments on these systems and carrying out rigorous hypothesis tests on the collected data, we provide compelling evidence showing that some of these qubits suffer from cross-talks, i.e., their measurement statistics are affected by the choice of measurement bases on another qubit. Unlike standard randomized benchmarking, our approach does not rely on assumptions such as gate-independent Markovian noise. Moreover, despite the relatively small number of experimental trials, the direction of "signaling" may also be identified in some cases. Our approach thus serves as a complementary tool for benchmarking the local addressability of quantum computing devices.</description>

Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the SU(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Refining spectroscopic calculations for trivalent lanthanide ions: a revised parametric Hamiltonian and open-source solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</description>

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that resonant driving between the spin up and spin down states of an electron spin-qubit in a quantum dot reduces the occupancy of the dot through leakage to an appropriately tuned lead. A nearby charge sensor measuring the occupancy of the dot should be able to detect the narrow resonant condition upon sweeping the driving frequency. The presence of interactions with noisy and thermal environments such as leads are an inherent part of creating and manipulating quantum information processing systems. This work is an example of how to incorporate methods from the ``open quantum systems'' perspective into descriptions of quantum devices. The method used here captures the coherent dynamics of the Rabi driving on the spin state of an electron tunneling into a lead, and yields full equations of motion for the interaction-picture density matrix with on- or off-resonance driving</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in chaotic quantum systems. Given the variety and multitude of condensed matter-type chaotic quantum systems, it may be considered as surprising how simple dynamics often are on the level of few body observables. In the context of this paper simple implies "in good agreement with a superpostion of only a few exponentially damped oscillations". We follow the (possibly somewhat odd) idea that it may be precisely the complexity of chaotic systems that entails the simpleness of their dynamics. We do so employing the framework of the recently resurged recursion method comprising Lanczos coefficients to generate the dynamics. We find that the structure of the Lanczos coefficients that enables simpleness is in accord with the operator growth hypothesis. We present a method to explicitly construct approximations to the dynamics from the Lanczos coefficients. These approximations result as simple for various chaotic spin systems. While the consideration applies to systems in the thermodynamic limit, we compare our approximations to state-of-the-art numerics for large but finite quantum systems and obtain good agreement.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescent colour centres on a mainstream silicon photonic foundry platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fabrication of silicon photonic components in commercial CMOS-compatible foundries has revolutionized the impact of silicon photonics on advancing communication, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, due to their benefits of mass production, high throughput, low cost, and high performance. The indirect bandgap of silicon introduces a fundamental challenge; thus, the mainstream silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform does not have efficient light sources. Recently, luminescent colour centres in SOI have emerged as one promising approach for developing efficient on-chip classical and quantum light sources, although past work has relied on custom fabrication that is not foundry-compatible. In this work, we demonstrate W-centre photoluminescence on a mainstream silicon photonics platform through development of a straightforward back end-of-line (BEOL) treatment. At an optimal implant energy of 7~MeV, we observed W-centre photoluminescence with a brightness comparable to prior in-house processes. We performed a series of experiments on Circular Bragg Grating (CBG) devices with varying pitches, duty cycles, and implant energies to confirm the PL emission from the encapsulated SOI device layer rather than the handle wafer.

      <title>Are Pseudo-Hermiticity and Generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-Symmetry Equivalent at Exceptional Points?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $\mathcal{X}:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[\mathcal{X},H]=0$ and $\mathcal{X}^2=1$. We show that this equivalence is generally valid for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. In particular, we establish the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry for arbitrary linear operators acting in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moir\'e lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moir\'e lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moir\'e effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moir\'e effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moir\'e parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moir\'e effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moir\'e metrology.</description>

      <title>Klein Tunneling in Uniaxial Strained Graphene under Super-Periodic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method (TMM) to analytically explore the impact of uniaxial strain on electron scattering in graphene under locally periodic and super-periodic electrostatic potential. Our study reveals that strain significantly influences electron transmission through the merging parameter $(\delta)$, which modulates the Dirac cone positions. a positive merging parameter ($\delta &gt; 0$) reduces the transmission probability by opening an energy gap at the merging point, while a negative merging parameter ($\delta &lt; 0$) enhances transmission by bringing the Dirac cones closer, facilitating electron transport at certain angles. However, the resonance peaks in super-periodic potential (SPP) are sharper for $\delta &lt; 0$, making them more pronounced but increasingly difficult to resolve as the number of barriers increases.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Probing of Lorentz-Violating Dispersion Relations via Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity frameworks predicting Planck-scale deviations from Lorentz invariance, we probe Lorentz symmetry violation via modified dispersion relations $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$. Departing from conventional approaches, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector to probe energy-dependent modifications to the dispersion relations. Two key methodological advances are introduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without assuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection paradigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$ through localized momentum-shell integration. By restricting detector-field interactions to narrow spectral windows and performing iterative Taylor expansions around reference momenta $|\textbf{k}_0|$, we derive coefficients encoding derivatives of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$, reconstructing its global profile via momentum-space tomography. The analysis reveals how deviations from linear dispersion relations disrupt the thermal character of the Unruh effect, while perturbative modifications preserve thermality at low energies. This approach offers a scalable method to test Lorentz symmetry violation across energy scales, and establishes a foundation for experimental verification of Planck-scale relics through high-precision spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard Model with Spin Flavor Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in optical lattices has established a platform for investigating correlated quantum matter with SU($N$) symmetry, offering highly tunable model parameters that allow experiments to access phenomena that are unavailable in conventional materials. Understanding the ground-state physics of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models away from the Heisenberg limit and from the spin-flavor balanced setting is important, as examining the flavor imbalance reveals new physics in Fermi-Hubbard models and shows how SU($N$) phases react to practical experimental imperfections in optical lattices. In this study, mean-field phase diagrams are presented for the unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at two sets of flavor densities, $\left(\tfrac{1}{3}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}\right)$ and $\left(\tfrac{1}{4}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{4}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{2}\right)$, with the flavor imbalance introduced as $\delta$. Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation on axially-symmetric surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in ideal bosonic gases confined to axially-symmetric surfaces of revolution, focusing on ellipsoidal and toroidal geometries. By formulating the single-particle Schr\"odinger equation for a general surface of revolution, we derive the corresponding energy spectra and analyze the impact of curvature on the quantum statistical properties of the system. Our results demonstrate that the geometric constraints imposed by these curved manifolds modify the energy spectrum and affect the critical condensation temperature. Specifically, we show that in ellipsoidal and toroidal manifolds, the critical temperature is suppressed as their aspect ratio is increased and, correspondingly, they become highly elongated and acquire a one-dimensional character. Additionally, we evaluate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, providing insights into the collective excitations of the condensate. Our results establish the conditions required to achieve quantum degeneracy in curved manifolds, thus guiding forthcoming experiments and setting the basis for solving the few-to-many body problem in general surfaces of revolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum Brownian motion of a point charge arising as a consequence of two fluctuating point-like boundaries. The study considers Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions imposed on a real massless scalar field. Additionally, we analyze the effects of a fluctuating compactification length on the random motion of the point charge, induced by the imposition of a quasi-periodic condition on the scalar field. By associating a wave function with the length scale of each system, we demonstrate that typical divergences, which commonly appear in scenarios with fixed boundaries and compactification size, are effectively smoothed out. This approach generalizes and extends previous results found in the literature, offering new insights into the regularization of divergences appearing in idealized systems.</description>

      <title>Nonseparability of multipartite systems in dilaton black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonseparability of N-partite quantum systems by employing the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) $q$-conditional entropy for both free bosonic and fermionic fields in the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. An intriguing finding is that the Hawking effect of the black hole can generate a net nonseparability of W state for fermionic field. Notably, we observe that fermionic nonseparability exhibits a stronger robustness than its bosonic counterpart, while fermionic coherence is found to be weaker than bosonic coherence within the dilaton black hole background. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the nonseparability of GHZ state is more pronounced than that of W state, yet quantum coherence of GHZ state is comparatively weaker than that of W state in dilaton spacetime. These results suggest that choosing the appropriate quantum resources for different particle types and quantum state configurations is essential for effectively tackling relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) on large amount of classical data can be both time consuming as well as expensive. Higher amount of training data would require higher number of gradient descent steps to reach convergence. This, in turn would imply that the QNN will require higher number of quantum executions, thereby driving up its overall execution cost. In this work, we propose performing the dataset distillation process for QNNs, where we use a novel quantum variant of classical LeNet model containing residual connection and trainable Hermitian observable in the Parametric Quantum Circuit (PQC) of the QNN. This approach yields highly informative yet small number of training data at similar performance as the original data. We perform distillation for MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets, and on comparison with classical models observe that both the datasets yield reasonably similar post-inferencing accuracy on quantum LeNet (91.9% MNIST, 50.3% Cifar-10) compared to classical LeNet (94% MNIST, 54% Cifar-10). We also introduce a non-trainable Hermitian for ensuring stability in the distillation process and note marginal reduction of up to 1.8% (1.3%) for MNIST (Cifar-10) dataset.</description>

      <title>A Multi Affine Geometric Framework for Quantum Nonlocality. Unifying Berry Phases, Entanglement, and Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a multi affine geometric framework to unify classical and quantum mechanical laws through the lens of information geometry. By combining the principle of stationary action with maximum entropy production, we show that divergences in dual affine connections naturally give rise to quantum interference and nonlocal correlations. These ideas of maximum entropy and stationary align with the framework of entropic dynamics, wherein time evolution emerges from information-theoretic principles. A key insight comes from Berry phases. the mismatch of multiple affine connections leads to a nontrivial holonomy or "area", explaining how Bell type inequalities can be violated up to the Tsirelson bound. Additionally, we interpret sharply peaked distributions as "pinning" or "sourcing" curvature in the information manifold, drawing an analogy to a membrane under uniform stress. In this view, entanglement and coherence emerge as geometric features, phases and rotations within an overarching multi affine structure. We conclude that phenomena such as wavefunction collapse and quantum steering can be viewed as constraints on the manifold's "laxity" or curvature, with far-reaching implications for understanding quantum behavior in a geometric-information setting.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic charge transport in extended SSH models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the topological properties of extended SSH models, considering four sub-lattices in a unit cell and second-nearest-neighbor intercell hopping for SSH4 and SSH long-range (SSHLR) models, respectively. The additional tuning parameters cause the SSH4 (SSHLR) model to host chiral symmetry protected two (two and four) zero-energy modes producing a richer phase diagram that we characterize by momentum space, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space winding numbers. We introduce time to study charge transport in the periodically driven SSH4 and SSHLR models under the adiabatic limit. We remarkably find that the whole parameter space turned topological for a certain choice of the remaining parameters leading to always finite quantized value of pumped charge at the end of a complete cycle. Considering time as another variable, we characterize these new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time evolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing windings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum value of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of the winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that there exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle compared to the underlying static models. We further extend our study to the quantum metric where the fluctuations in the above quantity can identify the presence of a topological phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Scalable architecture for dark photon searches: Superconducting-qubit proof of principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark photon is a well-motivated candidate of dark matter due to its potential to open the window of new physics beyond the Standard Model. A fundamental mass-range-sensitivity dilemma is always haunting the dark photon searching experiments: The resonant haloscopes have excellent sensitivity but are narrowband, and vice versa for the non-resonant ones. A scalable architecture integrating numerous resonant haloscopes will be a desirable solution to this dilemma. However, even the concept of scalable searching remains rarely explored, due to the size limitation of conventional haloscopes imposed by the dark photon wavelength. Here we propose and demonstrate a novel architecture using superconducting qubits as sub-wavelength haloscope units. By virtue of the scalability of superconducting qubits, it is possible to integrate multiple qubits with different frequencies on a chip-scale device. Furthermore, the frequencies of the qubits can be tuned to extend the searching mass range. Thus, our architectures allow for searching for dark photons in a broad mass range with high sensitivity. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we designed and fabricated a three-qubit chip and successfully demonstrated a scalable dark-photon searching. Our work established constraints on dark photons in the mass range of 15.632 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.638 $\mu$eV, 15.838 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.845 $\mu$eV, and 16.463 $\mu$eV$\sim$16.468 $\mu$eV, simultaneously, and the constraints are much more stringent than the cosmology constraints. Our work can be scaled up in the future to boost the scrutiny of new physics and extended to search for more dark matter candidates, including dark photons, axions and axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for experimental research and a challenging subject for theoretical investigation in quantum science. In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state of many-body Schr\"odinger operators for electrons in one dimension is non-degenerate. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a large class of distributions. In this setting, we show that the ground-state of the system with Fermi statistics and local boundary conditions is non-degenerate and does not vanish on a set of positive measure. In the case of periodic and anti-periodic (or more general non-local) boundary conditions, we show that the same result holds whenever the number of particles is odd and even, respectively. This non-degeneracy result seems to be new even for regular potentials $v$ and $w$. As an immediate application of this result, we prove eigenvalue inequalities and the strong unique continuation property for eigenfunctions of the single-particle one-dimensional operators $h(v) = -\Delta +v$. In addition, we prove strict inequalities between the lowest eigenvalues of different self-adjoint realizations of $H_N(v,w)$.</description>

      <title>EIT in V+ inverted $\Xi$ system using Rydberg state in thermal Rb atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg excitation using blue and IR transition is an advantageous path for quantum computation in alkali elements. Aiming to stabilize the IR laser for quantum computation, we study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum using Rydberg state in V+inverted $\Xi$ system (${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${5P_{3/2}}$ and ${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${6P_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${r=69D_{3/2}}$) in Rb vapour cell at room temperature. The probe laser absorption at 780 nm is monitored in the presence of the two control lasers at 421 nm and 1003 nm. In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</description>

Abstract: Modern cosmological theories invoke the idea that all structure in the Universe originates from quantum fluctuations. Understanding the quantum-to-classical transition for these fluctuations is of central importance not only for the foundations of quantum theory, but also for observational astronomy. In my contribution, I review the essential features of this transition, emphasizing in particular the role of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>Random quantum Ising model with three-spin couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a real-space block renormalization group approach to study the critical properties of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain with multispin interactions. First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact WKB analysis as a non-perturbative framework. While previous works focus mainly on stable systems, we explore quasi-stable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to non-polynomial potentials.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Vortex $\gamma$ Photons in All-Optical Inverse Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex $\gamma$ photons carrying orbital angular momenta (OAM) hold great potential for various applications. However, their generation remains a great challenge. Here, we successfully generate sub-MeV vortex $\gamma$ photons via all-optical inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons colliding with a sub-relativistic Laguerre-Gaussian laser. In principle, directly measuring the OAM of $\gamma$ photons is challenging due to their incoherence and extremely short wavelength. Therein, we put forward a novel method to determine the OAM properties by revealing the quantum opening angle of vortex $\gamma$ photons, since vortex particles exhibit not only a spiral phase but also transverse momentum according to the quantum electrodynamics theory. Thus,$\gamma$ photons carrying OAM anifest a much larger angular distribution than those without OAM, which has been clearly observed in our experiments. This angular expansion is considered as an overall effect lying beyond classical theory. Our method provides the first experimental evidence for detecting vortex $\gamma$ photons and opens a new perspective for investigating OAM-induced quantum phenomena in broad fields.</description>

Abstract: The sphere-packing bound quantifies the error exponent for noisy channel coding for rates above a critical value. Here, we study the zero-rate limit of the sphere-packing bound and show that it has an intriguing single-letter form, which we call the umlaut information of the channel, inspired by the lautum information introduced by Palomar and Verd\'u. Unlike the latter quantity, we show that the umlaut information is additive for parallel uses of channels. We show that it has a twofold operational interpretation: as the zero-rate error exponent of non-signalling-assisted coding on the one hand, and as the zero-rate error exponent of list decoding in the large list limit on the other.</description>

Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Complexity theory typically focuses on the difficulty of solving computational problems using classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main result consists of error reduction of this class and its variants with an exponentially small gap or bounded space, as well as how this class relates to other fundamental state synthesizing classes, i.e., states generated by uniform polynomial-time quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Furthermore, we establish that the family of UQMA witnesses, considered as one of the most natural candidates for stateQMA containments, is in stateQMA. Additionally, we demonstrate that stateQCMA achieves perfect completeness.</description>

      <title>QRCC: Evaluating Large Quantum Circuits on Small Quantum Computers through Integrated Qubit Reuse and Circuit Cutting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising computing paradigm for many application domains. However, the size of quantum circuits that can be run with high fidelity is constrained by the limited quantity and quality of physical qubits. Recently proposed schemes, such as wire cutting and qubit reuse, mitigate the problem but produce sub-optimal results as they address the problem individually. In addition, gate cutting, an alternative circuit-cutting strategy that is suitable for circuits computing expectation values, has not been fully explored in the field.
  In this paper, we propose QRCC, an integrated approach that exploits qubit reuse and circuit-cutting (including wire cutting and gate cutting) to run large circuits on small quantum computers. Circuit-cutting techniques introduce non-negligible post-processing overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cuts. QRCC exploits qubit reuse to find better cutting solutions to minimize the cut numbers and thus the post-processing overhead. Our evaluation results show that on average we reduce the number of cuts by 29% and additional reduction when considering gate cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction Using a Linear Array of Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum error correction architecture consisting of a linear array of emitters and delay lines. In our scheme, a resource state for fault-tolerant quantum computation is generated by letting the emitters interact with a stream of photons and their neighboring emitters. Depending on the number of emitters $n_e$, we study the effect of delay line errors in two regimes: when $n_e$ is a small constant of order unity and when $n_e$ scales with the code distance. Between these two regimes, the logical error rate steadily decreases as $n_e$ increases, from a scaling of $\exp(-c\eta^{-1/2})$ to $\exp(-c'\eta^{-1})$, where $\eta$ is the error rate per unit length in the delay line, for some constants $c,c'&gt;0$. We also carry out a detailed study of the break-even point and the fault-tolerance overhead. These studies suggest that the multi-emitter architecture, using the state-of-the-art delay lines, can be used to demonstrate error suppression, assuming other sources of errors are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic runtime advantage for all computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enduring challenge in computer science is reducing the runtime required to solve computational problems. Quantum computing has attracted significant attention due to its potential to deliver asymptotically faster solutions to certain problems compared to the best-known classical algorithms. This advantage is enabled by the quantum mechanical nature of the logical degrees of freedom. To date, it was unknown if permitting other parts of the computer to be quantum mechanical, rather than semi-classical, could yield additional runtime speed-ups as a function of resource utilization (e.g., power consumption or cooling requirements).
  In this work, we prove that when the control mechanisms associated with gate implementation are optimal quantum mechanical states, a quadratic runtime speedup (with respect to power consumption) is achievable for any algorithm, relative to optimal classical or semi-classical control schemes. Moreover, we demonstrate that only a small fraction of the computer's architecture needs to employ optimal quantum control states to realize this advantage, thereby significantly simplifying the design of future systems.
  We call this new device a quantum frequential computer, since the quantum speedup arises from an increase in gate frequency. In current state-of-the-art designs, gate frequency is often limited by the coupling strength between components. Notably, our approach achieves the speedup without requiring an increase in coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Classical Software Verification using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of accelerating the formal verification of classical programs with a quantum computer.
  A common source of security flaws stems from the existence of common programming errors like use after free, null-pointer dereference, or division by zero. To aid in the discovery of such errors, we try to verify that no such flaws exist.
  In our approach, for some code snippet and undesired behaviour, a SAT instance is generated, which is satisfiable precisely if the behavior is present in the code. It is in turn converted to an optimization problem, that is solved on a quantum computer. This approach holds the potential of an asymptotically polynomial speedup.
  Minimal examples of common errors, like out-of-bounds and overflows, but also synthetic instances with special properties, specific number of solutions, or structure, are tested with different solvers and tried on a quantum device.
  We use the near-standard Quantum Approximation Optimisation Algorithm, an application of the Grover algorithm, and the Quantum Singular Value Transformation to find the optimal solution, and with it a satisfying assignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) make the fast preparation of many-body states possible, circumventing the limitations of adiabatic strategies. We propose a fast STA protocol for generating interacting states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by counter-diabatic driving, stirring the dynamics with an auxiliary control field. To this end, we exploit the equivalence between the time-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an ensemble of quantum oscillators with driven mass and frequency. We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.</description>

      <title>A Greedy Quantum Route-Generation Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables; and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
  We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers. We also show its robustness to noise on D-Wave Advantage2 through computational results as compared to the filtering approach on DWaveSampler, even when the filtering approach is given a longer annealing time, and a larger sample size.</description>

      <title>Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms in Practice: Application to Ground-State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms focusing on ground-state energy estimation problems. In particular, we examine the computation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure of a Hamiltonian and the identification of its discontinuities. Scaling these methods to larger system sizes reveals three key challenges: the smoothness of the CDF for large supports, the lack of tight lower bounds on the overlap with the true ground state, and the difficulty of preparing high-quality initial states. To address these challenges, we propose a signal processing approach to find these estimates automatically, in the regime where the quality of the initial state is unknown. Rather than aiming for exact ground-state energy, we advocate for improving classical estimates by targeting the low-energy support of the initial state. Additionally, we provide quantitative resource estimates, demonstrating a constant-factor improvement in the number of samples required to detect a specified change in CDF. Our numerical experiments, conducted on a 26-qubit fully connected Heisenberg model, leverage a truncated density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) initial state with a low bond dimension. The results show that the predictions from the quantum algorithm align closely with the DMRG-converged energies at larger bond dimensions while requiring several orders of magnitude fewer samples than theoretical estimates suggest. These findings underscore that CDF-based quantum algorithms are a practical and resource-efficient alternative to quantum phase estimation, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analytically exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for neutral helium in the ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03020v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents the analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation and its corresponding wave function for the neutral helium or helium-like atoms in the ground state. The entangled state function of the electrons for S,L=0 is examined in detail. The basic idea is, though we treat the electron as a point like particle, not to understand its field as a point charge with the typical Coulomb field as in common approaches, but to solve the Schrodinger equation with an electric potential taking Heisenberg uncertainty principle into account. A method for describing a generic electron potential is derived, and the result was integrated into the Schrodinger equation. As a direct consequence the electromagnetic coupling of the electrons was investigated by introducing an effective interaction distance to describe vacuum polarization effects. The Schrodinger equation is solved using Laplace transformations. By motivating the effective interaction distance, the ground state energy was calculated and compared with the literature values. It could be shown that with a given value the backward calculation of the effective interaction distance gives plausible results of the ground state energy thus providing us with a convincing method to describe the helium atom analytically. An upper limit estimation for the spatial dimension of the interaction distance for quantum-electrodynamical effects around the electron is given as well as the existence of a minimal distance of a stable bonding state between two electrons in the nucleonic field. As a result, the chemical inertness of helium regarding chemical reactions i.e., the principle of the "closed" electron shell - can be made plausible. The wave function found for the helium atom is compared with the known solutions for the hydrogen atom and Hylleraas function as well, and differences between those are worked out.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Quantum States: A Pilot Study on Problem Solving in Quantum Information Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a big obstacle is the need to understand high-level mathematics to solve complex problems. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations in settings of problem solving can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to solely relying on symbolic problem solving content. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to represent not only single-qubit but also complex multi-qubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. In this pilot study, we aim to take a first step to identify in which contexts students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of single- and multi-qubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. For this purpose, we propose test items and a complete methodology to assess students' performance and cognitive load when solving problems. This is a pilot investigation with a large breadth of questions intended to generate hypotheses and guide larger-scale but more concrete studies in the future. Specifically, we compare two approaches: using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac Notation alone and using it accompanied by the (dimensional) circle notation. Analyzing time and performance, we find that most of the test items are appropriate for a heterogeneous target group as they can differentiate between the participants in regard to performance and time taken. In general, the A-B crossover structure of the study is suitable for investigating the benefits of visualization for problem solving with respect to length and feasibility. Future studies should, however, be more restricted in context because of the observable student and context dependence, with special interest lying in the further investigation of the Hadamard gate, the CNOT gate, and entanglement in multi-qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: Despite its ubiquity, the quantum many-body properties of dispersion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the entanglement distribution in assemblies of quantum Drude oscillators, minimal models for dispersion-bound systems. We establish an analytic relationship between entanglement and correlation energy and show how entanglement monogamy determines whether many-body corrections to the pair potential are attractive, repulsive, or zero. These findings, demonstrated in trimers and extended lattices, apply in more general chemical environments where dispersion coexists with other cohesive forces.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford and T-gate codes of short length and high distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-local interactions in several quantum device architectures allow for the realization of more compact quantum encodings while retaining the same degree of protection against noise. Anticipating that short to medium-length codes will soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that, for a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical gates with the fewest number of physical qubits. To this aim, we construct three kinds of codes encoding a single logical qubit for distances up to $31$. First, we construct the smallest known doubly even codes, all of which admit a transversal implementation of the Clifford group. Applying a doubling procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields the smallest known weak triply even codes for the same distances and number of encoded qubits. This second family of codes admit a transversal implementation of the logical $\texttt{T}$-gate. Relaxing the triply even property, we obtain our third family of triorthogonal codes with an even lower overhead at the cost of requiring additional Clifford gates to achieve the same logical operation. To our knowledge, these are the smallest known triorthogonal codes for their respective distances. While not qLDPC, the stabilizer generator weights of the code families with transversal $\texttt{T}$-gates scale roughly as the square root of their lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and solve a minimal model of dynamic passage through a second-order phase transition in the presence of symmetry breaking interactions and no dissipation. Our model generalizes the Hamiltonian dynamics of the Painleve'-2 equation to the case with many degrees of freedom, while maintaining the integrability property. The evolution eventually leads to a highly asymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking parameter of the Hamiltonian is. This suggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of quasi-particles with nearly identical characteristics. The model's integrability also yields exact exponents for the scaling of the density of the nonadiabatically excited quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two carefully designed distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, differing in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme employs faulty T-measurement, achieving infidelities of $O(p^3)$ for physical noise strength $p$. To achieve lower infidelities, our second scheme integrates distillation with `cultivation' (a distillation-free approach to fault-tolerantly prepare magic states through transversal Clifford measurements). Our second scheme achieves significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 2 \times 10^{-16}$ at $p = 10^{-3}$), surpassing the capabilities of both cultivation and single-level distillation. Notably, to reach a given target infidelity, our schemes require approximately two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the previous best magic state distillation schemes for color codes.</description>

      <title>Hardware-efficient quantum error correction via concatenated bosonic qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to solve problems of practical importance, quantum computers will likely need to incorporate quantum error correction, where a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits. The large physical-qubit overhead typically associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches. Here, using a microfabricated superconducting quantum circuit, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance $d=5$. The bosonic cat qubits are passively protected against bit flips using a stabilizing circuit. Cat-qubit phase-flip errors are corrected by the repetition code which uses ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement. We realize a noise-biased CX gate which ensures bit-flip error suppression is maintained during error correction. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below threshold, with logical phase-flip error decreasing with code distance from $d=3$ to $d=5$. Concurrently, the logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat-qubit mean photon number. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average $1.75(2)\%$ for the distance-3 code sections, and $1.65(3)\%$ for the longer distance-5 code, demonstrating the effectiveness of bit-flip error suppression throughout the error correction cycle. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings allows us to use a hardware-efficient outer error correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes are a compelling paradigm for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing could impact various industries, with the automotive industry with many computational challenges, from optimizing supply chains and manufacturing to vehicle engineering, being particularly promising. This chapter investigates state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across the automotive value chain. We explore recent advances in quantum optimization, machine learning, and numerical and chemistry simulations, highlighting their potential and limitations. We identify and discuss key challenges in near-term and fault-tolerant algorithms and their practical use in industrial applications. While quantum algorithms show potential in many application domains, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware limits scale and, thus, business benefits. In the long term, fault-tolerant systems promise theoretical speedups; however, they also require further progress in hardware and software (e.g., related to error correction and data loading). We expect that with this progress, significant practical benefits will emerge eventually.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove a necessary set of conditions which must be satisfied by any controlled gate in the qubit Clifford Hierarchy. These conditions are straightforward to derive yet quite restricting. We also extend our proofs to gates composed of certain direct sums of unitaries. Finally, we provide some evidence that these conditions are also sufficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study prethermal time-crystalline order in periodically driven quantum Ising models on disorder-free decorated lattices. Using a tensor network ansatz for the state which reflects the geometry of a unit cell of the lattice, we show through finite entanglement scaling that the system has an exponentially long-lived subharmonic response in the thermodynamic limit, which decays nonperturbatively in deviations from a perfect periodic drive. The resulting prethermal discrete time crystal is not only stable to imperfections in the transverse field, but also exhibits a bipartite rigidity to generic perturbations in the longitudinal field. We call this state a bipartite discrete time crystal and reveal a rich prethermal phase diagram, including multiple regions of bipartite time-crystalline order, uniform time-crystalline order and thermalization, with boundaries depending delicately on the topology of the decorated lattice. Our results thus uncover a variety of time crystals which may be realized on current digital quantum processors and analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect and super-accelerated thermalization in the damped quantum harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of systems far from equilibrium is often complex and unpredictable, challenging and sometimes overturning the physical intuition derived from equilibrium scenarios. One striking example of this is the Mpemba effect, which implies that non-equilibrium states can sometimes relax more rapidly when they are further from equilibrium. Despite a rich historical background, the precise conditions and mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effects within quantum systems. In this work, we explore a quantum manifestation of the Mpemba effect in a simple and paradigmatic model of open quantum systems: the damped quantum harmonic oscillator, which describes the relaxation of a bosonic mode in contact with a thermal bath at finite temperature $T$. By means of an exact analytical analysis of the relaxation dynamics based on the method of moments in both population and coherence subspaces, we demonstrate that any initial distribution of populations with the first $r$ moments exactly matching those of the equilibrium distribution shows a super-accelerated relaxation to equilibrium at a rate linearly increasing with $r$, leading to a pronounced Mpemba effect. In particular, one can find a broad class of far-from-equilibrium distributions that relax to equilibrium faster than any other initial thermal state with a temperature $T'$ arbitrarily close to $T$. The super-accelerated relaxation effect is shown to persist even for a broad class of initial states with non-vanishing coherences, and a general criterion for the observation of super-accelerated thermalization is presented.</description>

      <title>Optimization of two-photon absorption for three-level atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discusses the problem of optimal excitation of a three-level atom of ladder-configuration by light in the two-photon state and coherent light carrying an average of two photons. The applied atom-light interaction model is based on the Wigner-Weisskopf approximation. We characterize the properties of the optimal two-photon state that excites an atom perfectly, i.e. with probability equal to one: We find that the spectro-temporal shape of the optimal state of light is determined by the lifetimes of the atomic states, with the degree of photonic entanglement in the optimal state depends on the lifetime ratio. In consequence, two distinct interaction regimes can be identified in which the entanglement of the input state of light has qualitatively different impact.
  As the optimal states may be challenging to prepare in general, we compare the results with those obtained for photon pairs of selected experimentally-relevant pulse shapes. As these shapes are optimized for maximal atomic excitation probability, the results can be interpreted in terms of the overlap between the optimal and investigated pulse shapes.</description>

      <title>End-to-end QKD network with non-localized trust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</description>

Abstract: A Perceptron is a fundamental building block of a neural network. The flexibility and scalability of perceptron make it ubiquitous in building intelligent systems. Studies have shown the efficacy of a single neuron in making intelligent decisions. Here, we examined and compared two perceptrons with distinct mechanisms, and developed a quantum version of one of those perceptrons. As a part of this modeling, we implemented the quantum circuit for an artificial perception, generated a dataset, and simulated the training. Through these experiments, we show that there is an exponential growth advantage and test different qubit versions. Our findings show that this quantum model of an individual perceptron can be used as a pattern classifier. For the second type of model, we provide an understanding to design and simulate a spike-dependent quantum perceptron.

      <title>Device-independent, megabit-rate quantum random number generator with beam-splitter-free architecture and live Bell test certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generators (DI-QRNGs) are crucial for information processing, ensuring certified quantumness and genuine randomness. However, existing implementations often face low bit rates due to quantumness testing challenges. Here, we present a high-bit-rate DI-QRNG with live quantumness certification through the Bell test. Using spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a polarization Sagnac interferometer, we generate entangled pair-photons at diametrically opposite points on an annular ring with strong spatial and temporal correlations. Dividing the ring into six diametrically opposite sections, we create three entangled photon sources that exhibit bias-free quantum mechanical randomness from a single resource. By utilizing the coincidence counts of pair-photons from two sources, we generate raw bits, while the third source simultaneously measures the Bell's parameter without any loss of QRNG bits. We have generated 90 million raw bits in 46.4 seconds with the Bell parameter (S $&gt;$ 2), with a minimum entropy extraction ratio exceeding 97$\%$. Post-processed using a Toeplitz matrix, the DI-QRNG achieves a bit rate of 1.8 Mbps, passing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 tests. In the absence of Bell's parameter for a non-maximally entangled state, $g^{(2)}(0)$ can be the metric for quantumness measure. Scalable and beam-splitter-free, this megabit-rate DI-QRNG is ideal for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</description>

      <title>The Born rule -- 100 years ago and today</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Details of the contents and the formulations of the Born rule changed considerably from its inception by Born in 1926 to the present day. This paper traces the early history of the Born rule 100 years ago, its generalization (essential for today's quantum optics and quantum information theory) to POVMs around 50 years ago, and a modern derivation from an intuitive definition of the notion of a quantum detector. It is based to a large extent on little known results from the recent books 'Coherent Quantum Physics' (2019) by A. Neumaier and 'Algebraic Quantum Physics, Vol. 1' (2024) by A. Neumaier and D. Westra,
  Also discussed is the extent to which the various forms of the Born rule have, like any other statement in physics, a restricted domain of validity, which leads to problems when applied outside this domain.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</description>

Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics with profound implications for uncertainty relations and quantum information processing. In this paper, we extend the notion of {\em $s$-order incompatibility} of measurements, introduced by Xu (inspired by De Bi\`evre's ``complete incompatibility" ), to more general rank-one POVMs, and establish novel uncertainty relations. Furthermore, we investigate the incompatibility of multiple POVMs and its connection to support uncertainty relations. These results may have applications in quantum cryptography, quantum state reconstruction, and quantum compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>Locating Rydberg Decay Error in SWAP-LRU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms necessitates addressing inherent errors, particularly leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates. Such leakage induces two-qubit error chains, which degrades the error distance and compromise the performance of error correction. While existing solutions, such as hardware-specific protocols (Erasure Conversion) and circuit-based protocols, have demonstrated favorable error distances (d_e = d for pure Rydberg decay) and high error thresholds, they rely on significant additional hardware resources. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient approach to deal with Rydberg decay errors using SWAP-LRU, augmented by final leakage detection to locate errors. No additional resource is needed to remove leakage and renew atoms. When all leakage can be detected, we propose a located decoder and demonstrate a high error threshold of 2.33% per CNOT gate and demonstrate improved error distances for pure Rydberg decay, outperforming traditional Pauli error models. Furthermore, we introduce an alternative but more hardware-efficient solution, critical decoder. It only requires one type of leakage to be detected, yet effectively eliminates the damaging effects of Rydberg decay on sub-threshold scaling. Our findings provide new insights into located error and pave the way for a resource-efficient strategy to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum parameter estimation by analyzing the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the state parameters of accelerated detectors undergoing four different acceleration scenarios: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular motions. Our results show that QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a nonnegative asymptotic value over long evolution times, with this value strongly dependent on the specific acceleration scenario. In contrast, QFI for the weight parameter degrades to zero over time. Notably, for sufficiently large accelerations, optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter can be achieved within a finite evolution time rather than requiring an infinitely long measurement duration. Comparing different scenarios, we find that for small accelerations relative to the detector's energy gap, linear motion provides the most accurate estimation of the weight parameter, introducing the least noise among all scenarios. However, for large accelerations, circular motion becomes the optimal scenario for estimating the weight parameter. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the estimation of the acceleration parameter, where circular motion is optimal both for small accelerations and for large accelerations over extremely long evolution times. These distinctions in QFI may provide a new tool for identifying the specific acceleration scenario of an accelerated detector.</description>

      <title>Partial Quantum Shadow Tomography for Structured Operators and its Experimental Demonstration using NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum shadow tomography based on the classical shadow representation provides an efficient way to estimate properties of an unknown quantum state without performing a full quantum state tomography. In scenarios where estimating the expectation values for only certain classes of observables is required, obtaining information about the entire density matrix is unnecessary. We propose a partial quantum shadow tomography protocol, which allows estimation of a subset of density matrix elements contributing to the expectation values of certain classes of structured observables. This method utilizes tomographically incomplete subsets of single qubit Pauli basis measurements to perform partial shadow tomography, making it experimentally more efficient. We demonstrate the advantage over unitary $k$-designs such as Clifford, full Pauli basis, and methods utilizing mutually unbiased bases by numerically analyzing the protocol for structured density matrices and observables. We experimentally demonstrate the partial shadow estimation scheme for a wide class of two-qubit states (pure, entangled, and mixed) in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform, which relies on ensemble-based measurements. The full density matrix experimentally reconstructed by combining different partial estimators produces fidelities exceeding 97%.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Purification of Entanglement States in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider problems of distributing high-fidelity entangled states across nodes of a quantum network. We consider a repeater-based network architecture with entanglement swapping (fusion) operations for generating long-distance entanglements, and purification operations that produce high-fidelity states from several lower-fidelity states. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, while there have been several works on fidelity-aware routing and incorporating purification into routing for generating EPs, this paper presents the first algorithms for optimal solutions to the high-fidelity EP distribution problem. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for generating the optimal tree of operations to produce a high-fidelity EP, and an LP-based algorithm for generating an optimal collection of trees. Second, following the EP algorithms, this paper presents the first algorithms for the high-fidelity GHZ-state distribution problem and characterizes its optimality. We evaluate our techniques via simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and criticality enhanced quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exactly solved models provide rigorous understanding of many-body phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In this article, we report a breakthrough in uncovering universal many-body correlated properties of quantum integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We calculate exactly the dynamical correlation functions by computing the form factor through a newly developed method, by which we are capable of calculating all possible "relative excitations" over the ground state or a finite temperature state at a high precision. Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifests the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05724v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bounded quantum storage model aims to achieve security against computationally unbounded adversaries that are restricted only with respect to their quantum memories. In this work, we provide information-theoretic secure constructions in this model for the following powerful primitives: (1) CCA1-secure symmetric key encryption, message authentication codes, and one-time programs. These schemes require no quantum memory for the honest user, while they can be made secure against adversaries with arbitrarily large memories by increasing the transmission length sufficiently. (2) CCA1-secure asymmetric key encryption, encryption tokens, signatures, signature tokens, and program broadcast. These schemes are secure against adversaries with roughly $e^{\sqrt{m}}$ quantum memory where $m$ is the quantum memory required for the honest user. All of the constructions additionally satisfy disappearing security, essentially preventing an adversary from storing and using a transmission later on.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Hardness of Quantum One-Wayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output: respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators, the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators. This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c \log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit commitments.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting future physical behavior from limited theoretical simulation data is an emerging research paradigm driven by the integration of artificial intelligence and quantum physics. In this work, charge transport (CT) behavior was predicted over extended time scales using a deep learning model-the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an error-threshold training method-in the photosystem II reaction center (PSII-RC). Theoretical simulation data within 8 fs were used to train the modified LSTM network, yielding distinct predictions with differences on the order of $10^{-4}$ over prolonged periods compared to the training set collection time. The results highlight the potential of LSTM to uncover the underlying physics governing CT beyond conventional quantum physical methods. These findings warrant further investigation to fully explore the scope and efficacy of LSTM in advancing our understanding of photosynthesis at the molecular scale.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes using the velocity correlation function. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the velocity correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. We also find that the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for masssuperposed BTZ black holes. This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation, even in quantum-superposed spacetime.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Geometric Breaking of Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravity and Quantum Physics: Primordial Black Holes and Accelerated Evolution of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a new framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the fundamental role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light in the form of the experimentally discovered quantum photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantized gravitational, informational, thermodynamical, traditional, and other attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, the very early formation of galaxies, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and large-scale structures. Precise calculations have shown that primordial protogalaxies with supermassive black holes at their centers of gravity were formed before the recombination epoch. By solving issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter and dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and it's impact to cosmology. In such a way PBHs serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that presented PBH physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical issues, paradoxes and "mysteries", such as the accelerated evolution of the Universe established by JWST and other observations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The role of antisymmetric orbitals and electron-electron interactions on the two-particle spin and valley blockade in graphene double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</description>

      <title>A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>
