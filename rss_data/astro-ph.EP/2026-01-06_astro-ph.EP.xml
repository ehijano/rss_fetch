      <title>Observable Metal Pollution in Main-Sequence Stars: Simulations of Rocky Planets Engulfed by Stars in the $0.5$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The engulfment of planets by their host stars is an expected outcome of various dynamical processes and has been invoked to explain a variety of observed stellar properties, such as rapid rotation, chemical abundance abnormalities, and other transient phenomena. Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars. Our results can guide future observational campaigns that may search for sites of past or current engulfment events.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the relations between the properties of planetary systems and the chemical compositions of their host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</description>

      <title>Exo-Geoscience Perspectives Beyond Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the emerging field of exo-geoscience, focusing on the geological and geophysical processes thought to influence the evolution and (eu)habitability of rocky exoplanets. We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth's history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Based Dust Evolution in Disks: First Results from the RAPID Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\sim 0.005\,M_\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\,M_\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.</description>

      <title>The MUSCLES Extension for Atmospheric Transmission Spectroscopy: Spectral energy distributions for 20 exoplanet host stars that JWST observed in Cycle 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correctly interpreting JWST spectra of close-in exoplanets requires a measurement of the X-ray and ultraviolet light that the planets receive from their host stars. Here we provide spectral energy distributions (SEDs) covering the range $\approx5-1\times10^7$A for 20 transiting exoplanet host stars observed in JWST Cycle 1. The SEDs are constructed out of new and archival Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and/or XMM-Newton data combined with spectra from models or stars with similar properties (proxies) filling in unobserved gaps. We have also constructed SEDs of likely Habitable Worlds Observatory targets $\kappa^1$ Ceti, $\tau$ Ceti, $\epsilon$ Indi and 70 Oph B for use as proxies. We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation. Strong ongoing or past atmospheric escape is possible for a majority of these planets. We also assess the now considerable sample of panchromatic stellar SEDs and its applicability for current JWST observations and beyond.</description>

      <title>A new solar radiation pressure model for some orbit types in the cislunar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For satellites in the cislunar space, solar radiation pressure (SRP) is the third largest perturbation, which is only less significant than the lunisolar gravity perturbations. It is the primary factor limiting the accuracy of orbit determination for such satellites. Up to now, numerous SRP models have been proposed for artificial satellites close to the Earth, but these models have their shortcomings when applied to satellites in the cislunar space. In this study, we concentrate on various scenarios of cislunar satellites in periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We first employ the box-wing model to simulate the SRP effects and then propose an appropriate general SRP model based on these simulations, termed Empirical NJU Cislunar Model (ENCM). Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process. Comparisons with the conventional cannonball and ECOM models demonstrate that the ENCM model yields a significant improvement in orbit determination accuracy, showing promising potential for future cislunar missions.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI coronagraphic search for planets in systems with gapped exoKuiper belts and proper motion anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ALMA has uncovered a range of substructures within exoKuiper belts, pointing to a population of undetected planets. With JWST's sensitivity, we now have the opportunity to identify these planets thought to be responsible for the observed substructures in debris discs. We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 {\mu}m coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au.</description>

      <title>Physical Vetting of the Ultra-Short-Period Sub-Earth TOI 864.01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of TOI 864.01, a transit-like signal associated with the M-dwarf TIC 231728511. Utilizing the full baseline of TESS photometry (54 sectors), we recover a periodic signal with $P = 0.52067$ d and a shallow depth of $\sim$158 ppm. To assess the planetary nature of the candidate, we performed a rigorous vetting process combining centroid analysis, Bayesian model comparison, and false-positive probability calculations. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the sub-Earth candidate yielded inconclusive formal statistical validation metrics (FPP) and Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln Z$), we demonstrate the planetary nature of the system through physical exclusion of false positive scenarios. The TRICERATOPS Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of 0.0000, combined with centroid stability, rules out background contamination. Furthermore, we calculate that a stellar-mass companion at the derived orbital separation ($a \approx 5 R_\star$) would induce ellipsoidal variations of order $\gtrsim 5000$ ppm. The absence of such variations in the TESS photometry ($&lt; 200$ ppm limit) physically precludes stellar binary scenarios. We derive a planetary radius of $R_p \approx 0.55 R_\oplus$, confirming TOI 864.01 as a physically vetted ultra-short-period sub-Earth.</description>

      <title>Hunting for "Oddballs" with Machine Learning: Detecting Anomalous Exoplanets Using a Deep-Learned Low-Dimensional Representation of Transit Spectra with Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary disk cavities with JWST-MIRI: a dichotomy in molecular emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of planet-forming regions in protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance to understanding planet formation. Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a "cavity", have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where "molecule-rich" (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while "molecule-poor" (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both abiotic self-organization and biological mechanisms have been put forward as the origin of a number of geological patterns. It is important to comprehend the formation mechanisms of such structures both to understand geological self-organization and in order to differentiate them from biological patterns -- fossils and bio-influenced structures -- seen in geological systems. Being able to distinguish the traces of biological activity from geological self-organization is fundamental both for understanding the origin of life on Earth and for the search for life beyond Earth.</description>

      <title>Compensating Star-Trackers Misalignments with Adaptive Multi-Model Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF--MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.</description>

Abstract: We identify and correct for small but coherent instrumental drifts in seven years of radial velocity data from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES). The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional \'echellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $\rho$ Coronae Borealis ($\rho$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy of the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Exoplanetary Atmospheres Demarcated by their Birthplace</title>

Abstract: Atmospheric observations by JWST raise a growing evidence that atmospheric metallicity exhibits an anti-correlation with masses of giant exoplanets. While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.</description>

      <title>Wide-field Polarization Imaging and Numerical Modeling of the Coma and Tail of Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</title>

Abstract: Imaging polarimetry enables the spatially resolved investigation of cometary dust properties across different morphological structures. While cometary comae have been studied thoroughly in the pertinent literature, cometary tails have remained less explored. Comparing these regions can reveal differences in the size, structure, and composition of their dust. The goal of this study is to examine the size, structure and composition of the dust particles in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible differences. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in the visible to near-infrared domain in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range. An off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera was used in combination with a telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are complemented by T-matrix and Discrete Dipole Approximation modeling using the MSTM5 and DDSCAT software framework, respectively, for simulation of light scattering by dust particles of fractal agglomerate and agglomerate debris morphology. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Our modeling results suggest a 50:50 olivine-carbon composition. The fraction of agglomerate debris was found to be 50% in the coma and possibly higher in the tail. The differences between coma and tail in the observed maximum DoLP and the phase angle at which it occurs can be explained by a predominance of particles with radii larger than 0.6 micrometer in the coma vs. smaller sub-micrometer particles close to the Rayleigh limit in the tail [...]</description>

      <title>Orbit dissimilarity criteria in meteor showers: a comparative review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In meteor science, the identification of meteor showers is a crucial and complex problem. The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a database of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion (D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit dissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions associate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the threshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are thus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high number makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a review of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the algorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the search for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the existence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight different papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are usually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We discover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some have been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend performing a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical sense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and an orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a singular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.</description>

      <title>Limits on forming coreless terrestrial worlds in the TRAPPIST-1 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Structure of Jupiter's High-Latitude Storms: Folded Filamentary Regions Revealed by Juno</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p&lt;5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p&gt;10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>
