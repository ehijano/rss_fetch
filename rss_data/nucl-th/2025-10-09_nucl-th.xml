      <title>A novel way of recasting the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.</description>

      <title>Gamow shell model study of the 17Ne(p, p) reaction and of isospin symmetry breaking in 18Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unbound nucleus 18Na, acting as an intermediate nucleus in the sequential decay of 19Mg, is situated beyond the proton drip line. We employ the coupled-channel Gamow shell model (GSM-CC) to investigate the properties of 18Na, as well as the 17Ne(p, p) cross section. GSM-CC treats the nucleus as an open quantum system and provides a unified framework for studying both nuclear structure and reaction cross sections. Our calculations reproduce the energies and partial decay widths of low-lying states in 18Na, as well as the 17Ne(p, p) cross section. Additionally, the mirror nucleus 18N is also described. The isospin symmetry breaking induced by the Coulomb interaction and continuum coupling is clearly obtained in our description of 18Na and 18N properties, arising from the extended s1/2 partial wave. The isospin symmetry breaking in the 18Na/18N pair is compared to that occurring in the mirror pair 16F/16N, whereby similarities and differences are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Gamow shell model calculations for the Thomas-Ehrman shift in new isotopes 21Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-rich nuclei beyond the proton drip line exhibit unique phenomena, such as the Thomas-Ehrman shift (TES), providing valuable insights into nuclear stability and isospin symmetry breaking. The discovery of the lightest new isotope, 21Al, situated beyond the proton drip line, was recently reported in the experiment. In this study, we employ the Gamow shell model (GSM) to explore the TES in mirror pairs 21Al/21O, focusing on how this phenomenon affects the energy levels of these nuclei. Our calculations describe the ground state energies and reveal significant TES with large mirror energy differences in the excited mirror 1/2+ states in 21Al/21O. The large mirror energy difference is primarily due to the significant occupation of weakly bound or unbound s1/2 orbitals, resulting in the extended radial density distributions, and variations in Coulomb energy and nuclear interaction contributions between the mirror states. Additionally, the low-lying states of 21Al are also calculated with the GSM in coupled-channel (GSM-CC) representation, Furthermore, we also predict the cross-section of 20Mg(p, p) scattering, which serves as another candidate approach to study the unbound structure of 21Al in the experiment, offering a theoretical framework for studying the structure and reaction dynamics of 21Al in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Large scale shell model calculation for collectivity in nuclei beyond 78Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A shell model effective interaction for nuclei beyond the double magic nucleus 78Ni is constructed. First, the single-particle evolutions for valence neutrons above the double magic 78Ni are systematically explored in the N = 51 isotones using the large scale shell model (LSSM) calculations based on the constructed effective interaction. Subsequently, we calculate the excitation energies of 2+1 states and reduced electric quadrupole transition probabilities B(E2; 2+ to 0+) for N = 52 isotones. Notably, our calculation gives the result most consistent with the trend of the B(E2) values observed in the N = 52 isotones, especially for 84Ge, a result that poses a serious challenge to the theoretical model. Furthermore, the collectivity in N = 52 isotones, as well as the roles of pseudo-SU(3) symmetry, are investigated via the calculated primary configurations of their ground states and the first excited states. Additionally, the low-lying structures and band characteristics of neutron-rich Ge and Se isotopes are investigated. The ground state and the {\gamma}-soft band are constructed in our LSSM calculations, aligning well with available experimental evidence. Finally, we present the calculated evolutions of low-lying states in neutron-rich Ge and Se isotopes. The predictions for the as-yet unobserved low-lying states in these nuclei provide a comprehensive dataset to guide and inform future experimental efforts to decipher the evolution of shell structures and collectivity.</description>

      <title>Probing the Neutron Skin with Extreme Collision Geometries in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how protons and neutrons are located differently in an atomic nucleus can provide fundamental information on nuclear structure and have far-reaching implications for astrophysics. A precise determination of this important difference, often quantified by the so-called neutron skin thickness, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show how one can use a new category of observables in heavy ion collisions to probe the neutron skin thickness of nuclei like $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, by utilizing the asymmetry between neutrons and protons of spectator nucleons in super-central collisions as well as that of participant nucleons in peripheral collisions. Using quantitative simulations, we demonstrate their sensitivity and great potential in constraining neutron skin thickness for both $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca nuclei in these extreme event geometries. Furthermore, we propose the asymmetric collisions between $^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca nuclei as a unique and powerful way to nail down the neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of deuterons from simulations with hybrid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic flow of deuterons is measured on simulated collisions events of Pb+Pb at CMS energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair. We use hybrid model that includes hydrodynamics for the deconfined phase and hadron transport as an afterburner. For deuterons, two production mechanisms are examined: coalescence, and direct thermal production during hadronisation and subsequent transport through the hadronic phase. Differential elliptic flow of deuterons in different centrality bins is evaluated for both implemented production models. In this approach, coalescence describes the experimental data better than direct deuteron production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we aim to study collectivity in the Pb isotopes in the framework of nuclear shell model. We have performed shell-model calculations using KHH7B effective interaction. The model space of KHH7B interaction consists of 14 orbitals. We have reported results for even-even $^{196-206}$Pb isotopes for spectra and electromagnetic properties. The shell model results for isomeric states are also reported. Our results will be useful to compare upcoming experimental data.</description>

      <title>Determining the \Xi-Nucleus Potential from the Measured Binding Energies of ^15_\Xi^C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the deeply bound \Xi - hypernucleus ^15_\Xi^-C through the IRRAWADDY and KINKA events provided a crucial benchmark for determining the \Xi-nucleus interaction. This work aims to constrain the depth of this potential by calculating the binding energy B_\Xi of the ^15_\Xi C system, which forms a \Xi^- -^14 N bound state. We achieve this by numerically solving the Schroedinger equation for a \Xi hyperon within a phenomenological Woods-Saxon potential, using the stable Numerov method, incorporating the Coulomb interaction. For a potential well depth V_0 = 12 MeV, our calculations yield a 0^+_1 state binding energy of 6.35 MeV and a 1^-_1 state energy of 0.87 MeV. These results are in excellent agreement with the IRRAWADDY event (B_\Xi = 6.27 \pm 0.27 MeV) and the shallower 1^-_1 states (KISO/IBUKI events, B_\Xi \approx 1 MeV), respectively. Assuming \Xi^0 instead of \Xi^-, we predict the ground state 0^+ of _{\Xi^0}^{15}N with (B_{\Xi^0} = 2.636 MeV) by omitting the Coulomb interaction as a first approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing Strange Dark Matter through $f$-mode Oscillations of Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a hypothetical bosonic dark matter (DM) candidate, the sexaquark, on the fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars (NSs). By varying the DM particle mass and considering different core compositions including hypernuclear matter, sexaquark DM, and deconfined quark matter (QM), we construct hybrid equations of state (EOS) with a smooth hadron--quark crossover that remain consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Our analysis shows that the presence of these exotic components systematically alters quasi-universal $f$-mode relations. In particular, relations involving $f$--$\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$, $(R^{4}/M^{3}\tau)(C)$, $\omega M(C)$, require higher-order polynomial fits compared to standard studies. Quadratic forms remain sufficient for $f$--$\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$ and $\omega M(C)$, while damping-time relations such as $(R^{4}/M^{3}\tau)(C)$ demand higher-order corrections to capture their curvature. For $f(\Lambda)$, a cubic fit provides a satisfactory description. Within this extended framework the relations remain tight and effectively composition independent. These results suggest that precise $f$-mode measurements with future gravitational-wave detectors could provide clear signatures of DM and other exotic matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Charge state regulation of nuclear excitation by electron capture in $^{229}$Th ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) in $^{229}$Th holds significant potential for precise nuclear state manipulation. In this study, we thoroughly investigate NEEC in $^{229}\text{Th}^{q+}$ ions by integrating quantum numbers ($n, l, j$) effects and analyzing key parameters (e.g., resonance energy $E_r$, cross section $\sigma$, resonance strength $S$, and NEEC transition width $\Gamma_{\text{NEEC}}$) influences across charge state from $q=1^+$ to $90^+$. Especially, we focus on the charge-state regulation of the isomeric state (IS, 8.36 eV) and second-excited state (SE, 29.19 keV). Our calculations uncover critical charge-state-dependent behaviors of NEEC in $^{229}\text{Th}$ ions: (1) For the IS, valid NEEC channels exhibit threshold migration, where the dominant principal quantum number $n$ increases linearly with $q$ following the relation $n \approx 1.28q + 4.23$; meanwhile, single-$n$-channel $S$ stabilizes between $10^{-2}$ to $10^0$ barn eV via compensatory nucleus-electron coupling, ensuring the total resonance $S$ constant. (2) For the SE, its excitation energy far exceeds nearly all electron binding energies, leading to negligible channel screening and causing the total $S$ to increase monotonically with $q$. This research clarifies the intrinsic mechanisms of charge-state-driven nuclear-electronic interactions in $^{229}\text{Th}^{q+}$ NEEC and provides a critical reference for future experimental efforts to manipulate $^{229}\text{Th}$ nuclear states, particularly via indirect regulation of the SE.</description>

      <title>On fluctuation properties of MACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maxwellian Average Cross Section (MACS) is usually calculated with help of the statistical codes that do not take into account fluctuations of individual resonance parameters. The actual MACS can substantially deviate from its expectation value. This work focuses on description of various sources and aspects of these fluctuations. Simulated resonance sequences considering all the fluctuations involved in the statistical model are used for this purpose. Contribution of various sources of the fluctuations and neutrons with different orbital momenta are thoroughly investigated and described. Impact of available cross section data at low neutron energies is also checked. Based on this analysis simple empirical formulae for estimating relative fluctuations of MACS using solely $s$-wave resonance spacing $D_0$ and the temperature of the stellar environment are derived. It is shown that real nuclei follow the proposed formula well. The expected MACS fluctuations increase with $D_0$ and can be significant. While for isotopes with $D_0$ in eV range the possible deviation from calculated values are small, for nuclei with $D_0$ in the keV range the full-width half-maximum of the expected distribution is larger than about 25\% and 10\% for astrophysically relevant temperatures of $kT=8$ and 30 keV. At least for these nuclei the predictions from statistical codes must be taken with caution.</description>

      <title>Hartree-Fock emulators for nuclei: Application to charge radii of $^{48,52}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of complex structures of nuclei from chiral effective field theory (EFT) is a central challenge. The large number of low-energy couplings (LECs) in the EFT expansion and the significant cost of $\textit{ab initio}$ many-body calculations render large-scale sensitivity studies of many-body observables computationally prohibitive, necessitating the use of emulators as low-cost surrogates. In this work, we study a Hartree-Fock emulator based on eigenvector continuation to investigate trends in nuclear charge radii of neutron-rich calcium isotopes. We systematically vary the five LECs entering the leading three-nucleon (3N) interactions, and demonstrate the precision of the emulator through cross-validation over a wide parameter space. Our findings indicate that large charge radius increase from $^{48}$Ca to $^{52}$Ca is likely not explained by variations of the leading 3N couplings. This suggests that other effects, such as sensitivities to chiral two-nucleon interactions or neglected many-body effects, e.g., associated with nuclear collectivity, play an important role.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity in Fermi systems within the framework of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is based on lectures given by the author at the Enrico Fermi Summer School in Varenna. It presents the basics of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for Fermi superfluids, with particular emphasis on nuclear systems. Special attention is given to the foundations of both DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). The review explores the advantages and challenges involved in the practical application of TDDFT to superfluid systems, as well as the typical approximations employed. Various applications of the TDDFT framework to the description of phenomena related to nonequilibrium superfluidity in atomic nuclei, neutron stars, and ultracold atoms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar bosons under rotation and acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G&lt;0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Gluon splitting at small $x$: a unified derivation for the JIMWLK, DGLAP and CSS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to dijet production in electron-ion collisions at small $x$. We focus on the back-to-back configuration where the relative transverse momentum $P_\perp$ of the measured jets is much larger than both their momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ and the target saturation momentum $Q_s(x,A)$. In this regime, we present for the first time a complete calculation of the real NLO corrections at leading power in $1/P_\perp$. Our result exhibits TMD factorisation, with the same hard factor as at tree-level and a NLO correction to the Weisz\"acker-Williams (WW) gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution which involves four Wilson-line operators. By studying different kinematical regimes for $K_\perp$ and for the radiated gluon, we recover all the quantum evolutions that were previously identified for this process at NLO: the B-JIMWLK high-energy evolution and the CSS evolution of the gluon WW TMD, and the DGLAP evolution of the gluon PDF. When both $K_\perp$ and the transverse momentum transferred by the target are large compared to $Q_s$, all the Wilson-line operators boil down to the unintegrated gluon distribution and our NLO result for the gluon TMD can be used to isolate the transverse-momentum dependent gluon splitting function.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Spectra of $R$-Process Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the $\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.</description>

      <title>Effect of transverse momentum conservation and flow on symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric cumulants can improve our understanding of the joint probability distribution function $ P\left ( v_{m},v_{n},v_{k}, \dots,\Psi _{m},\Psi _{n},\Psi _{k},\dots \right )$, potentially offering new insights into the nature of the fluctuations of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the four-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, six-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nsc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ originating from transverse momentum conservation, collective flow, and the interplay between the two effects are calculated. Our results on $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ are consistent with the ATLAS data using the subevent cumulant method, facilitating a more profound understanding of the origins of the symmetric cumulant in small systems. Our results on $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ serve as theoretical predictions for future experimental measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Extended momentum-dependent interaction for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to light neutral hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are crucial non-perturbative components in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), playing a vital role in predictions and understanding of the hadronization process. In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\eta$, $\pi^0$ mesons, and $\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

Abstract: We provide a first-principle construction of baryons as quantum Hall droplets in single-flavor holographic QCD. The baryons are described as charged D6-branes with a circular boundary on a flavor D8-brane in the Type IIA backgrounds dual to the confining and non-confining phases. The holographic description allows us to calculate precisely their properties, such as mass and size. We also consider other objects with baryonic charge, such as vortons, domain walls with holes, and "sandwich vortons", and discuss the relative (meta)stability of all these configurations.</description>

      <title>Meson-baryon scattering lengths without annihilation diagrams to order $p^4$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the threshold $T$ matrices of the meson and baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams: $\pi^{+}\Sigma^{+}$, $\pi^{+}\Xi^0$, $K^+p$, $K^+n$, and $\bar{K}^0\Xi^0$ to the fourth order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By performing least squares and Bayesian fits to the non-physical lattice QCD data, we determine the low-energy constants through both perturbative and non-perturbative iterative methods. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the physical scattering lengths in these fits. The convergence behavior is not good across all channels in the perturbative method. The scattering lengths for the five channels, obtained by taking the median values from four different fitting approaches, are $a_{\pi^+\Sigma^+}=-0.16\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, $a_{\pi^+\Xi^0}=-0.04\pm0.04\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+p}=-0.41\pm 0.11\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+n}=-0.19\pm 0.10\,\text{fm}$, and $a_{\bar{K}^0\Xi^0}=-0.30\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, where the uncertainties are conservatively estimated by taking the maximum deviation between the median and extreme values of the statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>
