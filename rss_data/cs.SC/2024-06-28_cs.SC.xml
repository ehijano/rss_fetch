      <title>DNLSAT: A Dynamic Variable Ordering MCSAT Framework for Nonlinear Real Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfiability modulo nonlinear real arithmetic theory (SMT(NRA)) solving is essential to multiple applications, including program verification, program synthesis and software testing. In this context, recently model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) has been invented to directly search for models in the theory space. Although following papers discussed practical directions and updates on MCSAT, less attention has been paid to the detailed implementation. In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of dynamic variable orderings of MCSAT, called dnlsat. We show carefully designed data structures and promising mechanisms, such as branching heuristic, restart, and lemma management. Besides, we also give a theoretical study of potential influences brought by the dynamic variablr ordering. The experimental evaluation shows that dnlsat accelerates the solving speed and solves more satisfiable instances than other state-of-the-art SMT solvers.

      <title>Reasoning About Action and Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of AI research, ranging from basic work to interfaces and applications, with as much emphasis on results as on current issues. It is aimed at an audience of master students and Ph.D. students, and can be of interest as well for researchers and engineers who want to know more about AI. The book is split into three volumes.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning Abductive Reasoning using VSA Distributed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a model that solves abstract reasoning tasks based on Learn-VRF. ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/abductive-rule-learner-with-context-awareness.</description>
