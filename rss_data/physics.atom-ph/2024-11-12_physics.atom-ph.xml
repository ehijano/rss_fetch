      <title>Integrated-Photonics-Based Systems for Polarization-Gradient Cooling of Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions are a promising modality for quantum systems, with demonstrated utility as the basis for quantum processors and optical clocks. However, traditional trapped-ion systems are implemented using complex free-space optical configurations, whose large size and susceptibility to vibrations and drift inhibit scaling to large numbers of qubits. In recent years, integrated-photonics-based systems have been demonstrated as an avenue to address the challenge of scaling trapped-ion systems while maintaining high fidelities. While these previous demonstrations have implemented both Doppler and resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions, these cooling techniques are fundamentally limited in efficiency. In contrast, polarization-gradient cooling can enable faster and more power-efficient cooling and, therefore, improved computational efficiencies in trapped-ion systems. While free-space implementations of polarization-gradient cooling have demonstrated advantages over other cooling mechanisms, polarization-gradient cooling has never previously been implemented using integrated photonics. In this paper, we design and experimentally demonstrate key polarization-diverse integrated-photonics devices and utilize them to implement a variety of integrated-photonics-based polarization-gradient-cooling systems, culminating in the first experimental demonstration of polarization-gradient cooling of a trapped ion by an integrated-photonics-based system. By demonstrating polarization-gradient cooling using an integrated-photonics-based system and, in general, opening up the field of polarization-diverse integrated-photonics-based devices and systems for trapped ions, this work facilitates new capabilities for integrated-photonics-based trapped-ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling of a trapped ion in a phase-stable polarization gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions provide a highly controlled platform for quantum sensors, clocks, simulators, and computers, all of which depend on cooling ions close to their motional ground state. Existing methods like Doppler, resolved sideband, and dark resonance cooling balance trade-offs between the final temperature and cooling rate. A traveling polarization gradient has been shown to cool multiple modes quickly and in parallel, but utilizing a stable polarization gradient can achieve lower ion energies, while also allowing more tailorable light-matter interactions in general. In this paper, we demonstrate cooling of a trapped ion below the Doppler limit using a phase-stable polarization gradient created using trap-integrated photonic devices. At an axial frequency of $2\pi\cdot1.45~ \rm MHz$ we achieve $\langle n \rangle = 1.3 \pm 1.1$ in $500~\mu \rm s$ and cooling rates of ${\sim}0.3 \, \rm quanta/\mu s$. We examine ion dynamics under different polarization gradient phases, detunings, and intensities, showing reasonable agreement between experimental results and a simple model. Cooling is fast and power-efficient, with improved performance compared to simulated operation under the corresponding running wave configuration.</description>

      <title>Positron Channeling in Quasi-Mosaic Bent Crystals: Atomistic Simulations vs. Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on a comprehensive study of an ultra-relativistic positron beam deflection by an oriented quasi-mosaic crystal. The analysis was carried out for the positron energy of 530 MeV incident on the quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal. This particular case was chosen because it has recently been studied experimentally at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The results of the relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were compared with the experimental observations and a good agreement was found. The presence of planar channeling, de-channeling, volume reflection and volume capture processes in the angular distribution of deflected positrons for different beam-crystal alignments has been studied. Predictions have been made for certain crystal orientations for which experimental data are lacking.</description>

      <title>Control of the classical dynamics of a particle in the Morse-soft-Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the one-dimensional Morse-soft-Coulomb (MsC) potential consisting of a Morse repulsive barrier smoothly connected with a soft-core Coulomb potential at the origin. This new potential has a single parameter that controls the softness of the repulsive barrier and the well depth. When this softening-depth parameter tends to zero, the MsC potential approaches the Coulomb potential with an infinite repulsive barrier, a known successful model for the hydrogen atom. We investigate the classical chaotic dynamics of the MsC potential subjected to time-dependent external fields, comparing the results with the Coulomb potential. We show that the MsC potential reproduces the dynamics and the ionization probabilities of the Coulomb potential for sufficiently small values of the softening parameter. We also investigate the role of the softening parameter in the phase-space structures, showing that the increasing of its value leads to the increasing of the chaotic sea and consequently to the rise of the ionization probability. Finally, we address the problem of controlling the dynamics of a particle in the MsC potential from the perspective of optimal control theory, which cannot be easily applied in the case of the Coulomb potential due to the singularity at the origin. We analize a particular optimal solution to the problem of transferring a given amount of energy to the system at minimum cost. Our results show that the MsC potential can be a useful simple model for investigating the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Individual Addressing of Single Atoms in Quantum Registers at Three-Photon Laser Excitation of Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise individual addressing of single atoms in quantum registers formed by optical trap arrays is essential to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators. Two-qubit quantum gates are typically realized using coherent two-photon laser excitation of atoms to strongly interacting Rydberg states. However, two-photon excitation encounters challenges in individual addressing with tightly focused laser beams due to atom position uncertainty and the spatial inhomogeneity in both Rabi frequencies and light shifts. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the fidelity of individual addressing can be improved by employing coherent three-photon laser excitation of Rydberg states. For a specific example of $5s_{1/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_1}\!5p_{3/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_2}\!6s_{1/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_3}\!np$ excitation in $^{87}$Rb atoms, we find that upon strong laser coupling in the second step (Rabi frequency $\Omega_2$) and moderate coupling in the first and third steps (Rabi frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_3$), the three-photon Rabi frequency is given by $\Omega \!=\!\Omega_1\Omega_3/\Omega_2$. If the spatial distributions of $(\Omega_1\Omega_3)$ and $\Omega_2$ are arranged to be identical, $\Omega$ becomes independent of atom position, even within very tightly focused laser beams. This approach dramatically improves individual addressing of Rydberg excitation for neighboring atoms in trap arrays compared to conventional two-photon excitation schemes. Our findings are crucial for large-scale quantum registers of neutral atoms, where distances between adjacent atoms should be minimized to ensure stronger Rydberg interactions and compact arrangement of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for dipole-phonon quantum logic in a trapped calcium monoxide and calcium ion chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipole-phonon quantum logic (DPQL) offers novel approaches for state preparation, measurement, and control of quantum information in molecular ion qubits. In this work, we demonstrate an experimental implementation of DPQL with a trapped calcium monoxide and calcium ion chain at room temperature. We present evidence for one DPQL signal in two hours of data collection. The signal rises clearly above the characterized noise level and has a lower bound on the statistical significance of 4.1$\sigma$. The rate of observation is limited by the low thermal population in the molecular ground rotational state.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have not been systematic or have not used robust numerical methods. We report a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement employing a robust finite element method (FEM) in HelFEM that guarantees variational results and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution. Our fully numerical calculations are non-relativistic and are carried out at three levels of density functional theory with spherically averaged densities: the PW92, PBE, and r$^2$SCAN functionals. The three are in excellent agreement, confirming the physicality of our results.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the configurations - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. We consider both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies.
  Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 3-4, respectively.
  We also comment on deficiencies of a commonly used density based estimate for the van der Waals (vdW) radius of atoms, and propose a better behaved variant in terms of the number of electrons outside the vdW radius that we expect will prove useful in future studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent feedback control of an N-level atom with multiple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Squeezing atomic $p$-orbital condensates for detecting gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision gravitational wave measurement transforms research beyond general relativity and cosmology. Advances are made by applying quantum enhanced interferometry into the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors. Here, we develop an atomic sensor that employs a $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice to project gravitational wave signals into an orbital squeezed state. This entangled state couples linearly to the spacetime distortion signals received via a Michelson interferometer. Simulation data show that this sensor improves sensitivity over LIGO's quantum noise by approximately one order of magnitude and detection volume by $\sim 10^3$ in key frequency regimes. Additionally, it reduces the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. These results suggest that atomic orbital squeezing offers a compelling alternative to conventional techniques, offering a qualitatively different avenue for gravitational wave-based detection of dark matter, black holes, and the equation of state in neutron stars.</description>
