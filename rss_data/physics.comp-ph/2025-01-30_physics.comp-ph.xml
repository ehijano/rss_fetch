      <title>Copula methods for modeling pair densities in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach towards approximating the density-to-pair-density map based on copula theory from statistics. We extend the copula theory to multi-dimensional marginals, and deduce that one can describe any (exact or approximate) pair density by the single-particle density and a copula. We present analytical formulas for the exact copula in scaling limits, numerically compute the copula for dissociating systems with two to four particles in one dimension, and propose accurate approximations of the copula between equilibrium and dissociation for two-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Long-term prediction of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation using reservoir computing with data-driven realtime filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Carbon Footprint in ICT through Swarm Intelligence with Algorithmic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production were recorded in 2022, signaling a resurgence to pre-pandemic levels and providing an apodictic indication that emission peaks have not yet been achieved. Significant contributions to this upward trend are made by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry due to its substantial energy consumption. This shows the need for further exploration of swarm intelligence applications to measure and optimize the carbon footprint within ICT. All causative factors are evaluated based on the quality of data collection; variations from each source are quantified; and an objective function related to carbon footprint in ICT energy management is optimized. Emphasis is placed on the asyndetic integration of data sources to construct a convex optimization problem. An apodictic necessity to prevent the erosion of accuracy in carbon footprint assessments is addressed. Complexity percentages ranged from 5.25% for the Bat Algorithm to 7.87% for Fast Bacterial Swarming, indicating significant fluctuations in resource intensity among algorithms. These findings suggest that we were able to quantify the environmental impact of various swarm algorithms.</description>

      <title>Engineering Point Defects in MoS2 for Tailored Material Properties using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tunability of physical properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) through point defect engineering offers significant potential for the development of next-generation optoelectronic and high-tech applications. Building upon prior work on machine learning-driven material design, this study focuses on the systematic introduction and manipulation of point defects in MoS2 to tailor their properties. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the effects of various defect types and concentrations on the mate rial characteristics of TMDCs. Our methodology integrates the use of pre-trained large language models to generate defect configurations, enabling efficient predictions of defect-induced property modifications. This research differs from traditional methods of material generation and discovery by utilizing the latest advances in transformer model architecture, which have proven to be efficient and accurate discrete predictors. In contrast to high-throughput methods where configurations are generated randomly and then screened based on their physical properties, our approach not only enhances the understanding of defect-property relationships in TMDCs but also provides a robust framework for designing materials with bespoke properties. This facilitates the advancement of materials science and technology.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model to Predict Particle Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery and study of new material systems relies on molecular simulations that often come with significant computational expense. We propose MDDM, a Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model, which is capable of predicting a valid output conformation for a given input pair potential function. After training MDDM on a large dataset of molecular dynamics self-assembly results, the proposed model can convert uniform noise into a meaningful output particle structure corresponding to an arbitrary input potential. The model's architecture has domain-specific properties built-in, such as satisfying periodic boundaries and being invariant to translation. The model significantly outperforms the baseline point-cloud diffusion model for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Observation of Non-Ergodic States in Two-Dimensional Non-Topological Bubble Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered 2D lattices, including hexatic and various glassy states, are observed in a wide range of 2D systems including colloidal nanoparticle assemblies and fluxon lattices. Their disordered nature determines the stability and mobility of these systems, as well as their response to the external stimuli. Here we report on the controlled creation and characterization of a disordered 2D lattice of non-topological magnetic bubbles in the non-centrosymmetric ferrimagnetic alloy Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. By analyzing the type and frequency of fundamental lattice defects, such as dislocations, the orientational correlation, as well as the induced motion of the lattice in an external field, a non-ergodic glassy state, stabilized by directional application of an external field, is revealed.</description>

      <title>Intermittent molecular motion and first passage statistics for the NMR relaxation of confined water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of fluids confined in nanoporous media differ from those in bulk, which can be probed using NMR relaxation measurements. We here show, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of water in a slit nanopore, that the behavior of the NMR relaxation rate, R1, with varying surface interaction and confinement strength can be estimated from the exchange statistics of fluid molecules between the adsorbed surface layer and the bulk region, where molecules undergo intermittent dynamics. We employ first return passage time calculations to quantify the molecular exchange statistics, thereby linking microscopic parameters of the confined fluid-such as adsorption time, pore size, and diffusion coefficient-to the NMR relaxation rate. This approach allows to predict and interpret the molecular relaxation of fluids at interfaces using merely concepts of statistical mechanics and can be generalized to closed and open geometries.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning study of phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Heatbath Algorithm in LFT using Generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heatbath Algorithm is commonly used for sampling in local lattice field theories, but performing exact updates or sampling from the local density is challenging when dealing with continuous variables. Heatbath methods rely on rejection-based sampling at each site, which can suffer from low acceptance rates if the proposal distribution is not optimally chosen a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a novel, straightforward approach for generating proposals at each lattice site for the phi4 and XY models using generative AI models. This method learns a conditional local distribution, without requiring training samples from the target, conditioned on both neighboring sites and action parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that accurately simulates a multidisperse suspension of interacting spherical particles. Our machine learning framework is built upon the recent work of Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. ICML, PMLR, 119, 8459-8468 (2020) on graph network simulators, and efficiently learns the intricate dynamics of the interacting particles. Nodes and edges of the GNN correspond, respectively, to the particles with their individual properties/data (e.g., radius, position, velocity) and the pairwise interactions between the particles (e.g., electrostatics, hydrodynamics). A key contribution of our work is to account for the finite dimensions of the particles and their impact on the system dynamics. We test our GNN against a representative case study of a multidisperse mixture of two-dimensional spheres sedimenting under gravity in a liquid and interacting with each other by a Lennard-Jones potential. The present GNN framework offers a fast and accurate method for the theoretical study of complex physical systems such as field-induced behavior of colloidal suspensions and ionic liquids. Our implementation of the GNN is available on GitHub at github.com/rfjd/GNS-DispersedSystems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Bloch points using micromagnetic and Heisenberg models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present an exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamic foundation of the grand-potential phase field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy when mass conservation is imposed. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of isochemical potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Approximation of High-Dimensional Gibbs Distributions with Functional Hierarchical Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical representation of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality manifesting through the intractable normalization constant calculations. This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.</description>
