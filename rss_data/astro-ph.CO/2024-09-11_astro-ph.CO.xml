      <title>Inferring the density, spin-temperature and neutral-fraction fields of HI from its 21-cm brightness temperature field using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm brightness-temperature field of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn is a rich source of cosmological and astrophysical information, primarily due to its significant non-Gaussian features. However, the complex, nonlinear nature of the underlying physical processes makes analytical modelling of this signal challenging. Consequently, studies often resort to semi-numerical simulations. Traditional analysis methods, which rely on a limited set of summary statistics, may not adequately capture the non-Gaussian content of the data, as the most informative statistics are not predetermined. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) to surpass the limitations of summary statistics by leveraging the inherent non-Gaussian characteristics of the 21-cm signal. We demonstrate that a well-trained neural network can independently reconstruct the hydrogen density, spin-temperature, and neutral-fraction fields with cross-coherence values exceeding 0.95 for $k$-modes below $0.5$ Mpc h$^{-1}$, based on a representative simulation at a redshift of $z \approx 15$. To achieve this, the neural network utilises the non-Gaussian information in brightness temperature images over many scales. We discuss how these reconstructed fields, which vary in their sensitivity to model parameters, can be employed for parameter inference, offering more direct insights into underlying cosmological and astrophysical processes only using limited summary statistics of the brightness temperature field, such as its power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for uncorrected gain factors in Galactic synchrotron template maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 408 MHz Haslam map is widely used as a low-frequency anchor for the intensity and morphology of Galactic synchrotron emission. Multi-frequency, multi-experiment fits show evidence of spatial variation and curvature in the synchrotron frequency spectrum, but there are also poorly-understood gain factors between experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison across a range of scenarios, using fits that include recent spectroscopic observations at $\sim 1$~GHz by MeerKAT. A large uncorrected gain factor of about 60\% in the Haslam data is strongly preferred, partly undermining its use as a reference template.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Very Early Dark Energy in the Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like scalar fields can induce temporary deviations from the standard expansion history of the universe. The scalar field's contribution to the energy density of the universe grows while the field is held constant by Hubble friction, but when the scalar field starts to evolve, its energy density decreases faster than the radiation density for some potentials. We explore the observational signatures of such a scalar field that becomes dynamical between big bang nucleosynthesis and matter-radiation equality, which we call very Early Dark Energy (vEDE). If vEDE momentarily dominates the energy density of the universe, it generates a distinctive feature in the matter power spectrum that includes a bump on scales that enter the horizon just after the scalar field starts to evolve. For $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, the amplitude of this bump can exceed the amplitude of the standard matter spectrum. The power on scales on either side of this peak is suppressed relative to the standard power spectrum, but only scales that are within the horizon while the scalar field makes a significant contribution to the total energy density are affected. We determine how vEDE scenarios are constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background, measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, and probes of the late-time expansion history. We find that current observations are consistent with vEDE scenarios that enhance power on scales $k \gtrsim 30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and nearly double the amplitude of the matter power spectrum around $200\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. These scenarios also suppress power on scales between $0.3\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Deriving Cosmological Parameters from the Euclid mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid mission is a visionary project undertaken by the European Space Agency (ESA) to probe the universe's evolution and geometry by surveying the position and gravitational shape distortion of billions of galaxies. These observations bear the potential to offer unprecedented measurements of the cosmological parameters, thereby advancing our understanding of the cosmos. This work revolves around the central theme of quantifying the constraining power of the upcoming Euclid 3$\times$2pt photometric survey, accounting for several factors which have been neglected to this date in the official forecasts, especially more subtle sources of uncertainty which need to be included in the forecast (and data) analysis due to the precision of the observations. First, we include and study the impact of super-sample covariance, a source of sample variance coming from the incomplete sampling of the density and shear field Fourier modes caused by the limited survey volume. Second, we examine the effect of scale cuts, translating them from Fourier to harmonic space through the use of the BNT transform, which offers an efficient way of separating angular scales for the cosmic shear signal. This analysis allows quantifying and mitigating the bias coming from the uncertainty on our modelling of small scales. These updated forecasts, validated against the reference Euclid ones, provide insights into the expected precision achieved on the cosmological and nuisance parameters, for a variety of survey settings and for the inclusion of different realistic systematics, such as multiplicative shear bias, magnification bias, uncertainty in the mean of the redshift distribution and so on.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G282.28+49.94, a recently discovered analogue of the famous Bullet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the gas and galaxy properties of the cluster PSZ2 G282.28+49.94 detected in the Planck all-sky survey. The intracluster medium (ICM) of this object at z=0.56 exhibits a cometary-like shape. Combining Chandra and TNG observations, we characterised the spatially resolved thermodynamical properties of the gas and the spatial and velocity distribution of 73 galaxy members. The cluster structure is quite complex with an elongated core region containing the two brightest cluster galaxies and one dense group to the south-east. Since there is no velocity difference between the core and the south-east group, we suggest the presence of a merger along the plane of the sky. This structure is related to complex X-ray and radio features, and thus the merger has likely been caught during the post-merger phase. Comparing the distribution of the ICM and of member galaxies, we find a large offset of $\sim 350$ kpc between the position of the X-ray peak and the centre of a concentration of galaxies, preceding it in the likely direction of motion. This configuration is similar to the famous Bullet Cluster, leading us to dub PSZ2 G282.28+49.94 the "Planck bullet", and represents an ideal situation to provide astrophysical constraints to the self-interaction cross-section ($\sigma/m$) of dark matter particles. These results illustrate the power of a multi-wavelength approach to probe the merging scenario of such complex and distant systems.</description>

      <title>Reionization morphology and intrinsic velocity offsets allow transmission of Lyman-{\alpha} emission from JADES-GS-z13-1-LA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies at the onset of cosmic reionization, aiming to understand the conditions necessary for detecting high-redshift sources like JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z=13$. By integrating galaxy formation models with detailed intergalactic medium (IGM) reionization simulations, we construct high-redshift galaxy catalogs to model intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles and assess their transmission through the IGM. For a galaxy with $M_{\rm UV}\sim -18.5$ like JADES-GS-z13-1-LA, our fiducial model predicts a Ly$\alpha$ transmission of ${\sim}13$% and there is a probability of observing Ly$\alpha$ emission with an equivalent width &gt;40A of up to 10%. We also explore how variations in the UV ionizing escape fraction, dependent on host halo mass, impact Ly$\alpha$ detectability. Our findings reveal that reionization morphology significantly influences detection chances -- models where reionization is driven by low-mass galaxies can boost the detection probability to as much as 12%, while those driven by massive galaxies tend to reduce ionized regions around faint emitters, limiting their detectability. This study underscores the importance of reionization morphology in interpreting high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ observations.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Stellar reddening map from DESI imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05140v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new Galactic reddening maps of the high Galactic latitude sky using DESI imaging and spectroscopy. We directly measure the reddening of 2.6 million stars by comparing the observed stellar colors in $g-r$ and $r-z$ from DESI imaging with the synthetic colors derived from DESI spectra from the first two years of the survey. The reddening in the two colors is on average consistent with the \cite{fitzpatrick_correcting_1999} extinction curve with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1$. We find that our reddening maps differ significantly from the commonly used \cite{schlegel_maps_1998} (SFD) reddening map (by up to 80 mmag in $E(B-V)$), and we attribute most of this difference to systematic errors in the SFD map. To validate the reddening map, we select a galaxy sample with extinction correction based on our reddening map, and this yields significantly better uniformity than the SFD extinction correction. Finally, we discuss the potential systematic errors in the DESI reddening measurements, including the photometric calibration errors that are the limiting factor on our accuracy. The $E(g-r)$ and $E(g-r)$ maps presented in this work, and for convenience their corresponding $E(B-V)$ maps with SFD calibration, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Wave effect of gravitational waves intersected with a microlens field II: an adaptive hierarchical tree algorithm and population study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing wave effect generated by a microlensing field embedded in a lens galaxy is an inevitable phenomenon in strong lensed gravitational waves (SLGWs). This effect presents both challenges and opportunities for the detection and application of SLGWs. However, investigating this wave effect requires computing a complete diffraction integral over each microlens in the field. This is extremely time-consuming due to the large number of microlenses. Therefore, simply adding all the microlenses is impractical. Additionally, the complexity of the time delay surface makes the lens plane resolution a crucial factor in controlling numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a trapezoid approximation-based adaptive hierarchical tree algorithm to meet the challenges of calculation speed and precision. We find that this algorithm accelerates the calculation by four orders of magnitude compared to the simple adding method and is one order of magnitude faster than the fixed hierarchical tree algorithm proposed for electromagnetic microlensing. More importantly, our algorithm ensures controllable numerical errors, increasing confidence in the results. Together with our previous work, this paper addresses all numerical issues, including integral convergence, precision, and computational time. Finally, we conducted a population study on the microlensing wave effect of SLGWs using this algorithm and found that the microlensing wave effect cannot be ignored, especially for Type II SLGWs due to their intrinsic geometric structures and their typical intersection with a denser microlensing field. Statistically, more than 33% (11%) of SLGWs have a mismatch larger than 1% (3%) compared to the unlensed waveform. Additionally, we found that the mismatch between signal pairs in a doubly imaged GW is generally larger than 10^{-3}, and 61% (25%) of signal pairs have a mismatch larger than 1% (3%).</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Interactions with ACT, SPT and DES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of a dark radiation sector with a mass threshold (WZDR+) have proved to be an appealing alternative to $\Lambda$CDM. These models provide simple comparison models, grounded in well-understood particle physics and with limited additional parameters. In addition, they have shown relevance in easing existing cosmological tensions, specifically the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ tension. Recently, measurements of CMB lensing by the ACT collaboration have provided strong additional information on clustering at late times. Within $\Lambda$CDM, these results yield a high value of $S_8$ at odds with weak-lensing measurements. In this work, we study this in the context of WZDR+, and find a much wider range of allowed values of $S_8$, and in particular much better agreement between data sets and an overall improvement of fit versus $\Lambda$CDM. We expand our analyses to include a wide set of data, including the ACT-DR6 lensing data, as well as primary CMB information from ACT-DR4 and SPT-3G, scale-dependent power spectra from DES and measurements of $H_0$ from SH0ES. We find that there is little to no tension in measurements of structure within the data sets, and the inferred value of $S_8$ is generally lower than that in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the inclusion of DES generally favors a higher $H_0$, but there is some direct tension between the high-$\ell$ multipole data and this result. Future data should clarify whether this is a statistical artifact, or a true incompatibility of these datasets within this model.</description>

      <title>Non-Canonical Dark Energy Parameter Evolution in a Canonical Quintessence Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers the specific case of a flat, minimally coupled to gravity, quintessence cosmology with a dark energy quartic polynomial potential that has the same mathematical form as the Higgs potential. Previous work on this case determined that the scalar field is given by a simple expression of the Lambert W function in terms of the easily observable scale factor. This expression provides analytic equations for the evolution of cosmological dark energy parameters as a function of the scale factor for all points on the Lambert W function principal branch. The Lambert W function is zero at a scale factor of zero that marks the big bang. The evolutionary equations beyond the big bang describe a canonical universe that is similar to {\Lambda}CDM, making it an excellent dynamical template to compare with observational data. The portion of the W function principal before the big bang extends to the infinite pre-bang past. It describes a noncanonical universe with an initially very low mass density that contracts by rolling down the dark energy potential to a singularity, big bang, at the scale factor zero point. This provides a natural origin for the big bang. It also raises the possibility that the universe existed before the big bang and is far older, and that it was once far larger than its current size. The recent increasing interest in the possibility of a dynamical universe instead of {\Lambda}CDM makes the exploration of the nature of such universes particularly relevant.</description>

      <title>On the implausible physical implications of a claimed lensed neutral hydrogen detection at redshift z = 1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array mid-frequency array will enable high-redshift detections of neutral hydrogen (HI) emission in galaxies, providing important constraints on the evolution of cold gas in galaxies over cosmic time. Strong gravitational lensing will push back the HI emission frontier towards cosmic noon ($z\sim2$), as has been done for all prominent spectral lines in the interstellar medium of galaxies. Chakraborty &amp; Roy (2023, MNRAS, 519, 4074) report a $z=1.3$ HI emission detection towards the well-modelled, galaxy-scale gravitational lens, SDSS J0826+5630. We carry out HI source modelling of the system and find that their claimed HI magnification, $\mu_{\rm HI} = 29 \pm 6$, requires an HI disk radius of $\lesssim 1.5$ kpc, which implies an implausible mean HI surface mass density in excess of $\Sigma_{\rm HI} &gt; 2000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. This is several orders of magnitude above the highest measured peak values $(\Sigma_{\rm HI} \sim 10 \, {\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2})$, above which HI is converted into molecular hydrogen. Our re-analysis requires this to be the highest HI mass galaxy known (M$_{\rm HI}~\sim 10^{11}$M$_\odot$), as well as strongly lensed, the latter having a typical probability of order 1 in 10$^{3-4}$. We conclude that the claimed detection is spurious.</description>

Abstract: The reconstruction of an inflationary universe considering the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds in the framework of a modified Friedmann equation is analyzed. In this context, we examine the possibility of reconstructing the Hubble parameter together with the effective potential considering a modified Friedmann equation specified by $\mathcal{F}(H)\propto \rho$, where $\mathcal{F}(H)$ corresponds to an arbitrary function of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $\rho$ denotes the energy density associated with the matter in the universe. To reconstruct the background variables during the inflationary scenario, we develop a new methodology by expressing the spectral index in terms of the Hubble parameter and its derivatives. Thus, we obtain a general formalism for the reconstruction of the inflation, using the slow roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. As specific examples, we consider the simplest attractor $n_s-1=-2/N$ together with different functions $\mathcal{F}(H)$, associated to the modified Friedmann equation, to rebuild the Hubble parameter and the effective potential in terms of the scalar field $\phi$. Additionally, we examine the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, in which we determine the temperature and the number of e-folds during this epoch, using the background variables found during the reconstruction of the different $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models studied. Besides, we constrain the different parameters associated with the reconstructed inflationary $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models during the epochs of inflation and reheating, using current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.</description>

      <title>The Blending ToolKit: A simulation framework for evaluation of galaxy detection and deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open source Python library for simulating overlapping (i.e., blended) images of galaxies and performing self-consistent comparisons of detection and deblending algorithms based on a suite of metrics. The package, named Blending Toolkit (BTK), serves as a modular, flexible, easy-to-install, and simple-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing systematic effects related to blended galaxies in cosmological surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). BTK has three main components: (1) a set of modules that perform fast image simulations of blended galaxies, using the open source image simulation package GalSim; (2) a module that standardizes the inputs and outputs of existing deblending algorithms; (3) a library of deblending metrics commonly defined in the galaxy deblending literature. In combination, these modules allow researchers to explore the impacts of galaxy blending in cosmological surveys. Additionally, BTK provides researchers who are developing a new deblending algorithm a framework to evaluate algorithm performance and make principled comparisons with existing deblenders. BTK includes a suite of tutorials and comprehensive documentation. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/BlendingToolKit.</description>

Abstract: This work continues the research presented in the article [1], where we estimate the Gertsenshtein effect's influence on the long-wavelength part of relic gravitational wave spectrum. Here, the differential equation system for the Gertsenshtein effect in Friedman-LeMaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, derived in [1], is simplified for gravitational waves in the under-horizon regime during radiation dominance epoch. Then, the obtained system is solved analytically. As a result of the solution analysis a conclusion was made about a significant increase of relic GWs with the frequencies $ k\gtrsim 10^{-11}$ Hz for magnetic field strength about 1 nGs. In addition, at the end of the article model dependency of the result is discussed</description>

      <title>A Post-Starburst Pathway to Forming Massive Galaxies and Their Black Holes at z&gt;6</title>

Abstract: Understanding the rapid formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe requires an understanding of how stellar mass grows in the host galaxies. Here, we perform an analysis of rest-frame optical spectra and imaging from JWST of two quasar host galaxies at z&gt;6 which exhibit Balmer absorption lines. These features in the stellar continuum indicate a lack of young stars, similar to low-redshift post-starburst galaxies whose star formation was recently quenched. We find that the stellar mass (log(M_* / M_sun) &gt; 10.6) of each quasar host grew in a starburst episode at redshift 7 or 8. One of the targets exhibits little ongoing star formation, as evidenced by the photometric signature of the Balmer break and a lack of spatially resolved H-alpha emission, placing it well below the star formation main sequence at z = 6. The other galaxy is transitioning to a quiescent phase; together, the two galaxies represent the most distant massive post-starburst galaxies known. The maturity of these two galaxies is further supported by the stellar velocity dispersions of their host galaxies, placing them slightly above the upper end of the local M_BH - sigma_* relation. The properties of our two post-starburst galaxies, each hosting an active SMBH with log(M_BH / M_sun) &gt; 9, suggests that black holes played a major role in shaping the formation of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We found that, unlike General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories provides black holes with primary hair, which are thermodynamically stable and compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope observations for M87* and Sgr A* black holes. We first investigate its thermodynamic properties by studying the influence of the primary hair on the thermodynamic quantities and the local stability, imposing severe constraints in the allowed range of the primary hair values. Then, we analyze the null geodesics near this black hole, demonstrating how the scalar hair influences the shadow diameter, finding that higher values of the primary hair lead to smaller shadow sizes. Additionally, we constrain the scalar hair using the observational data, revealing its sensitivity to the choice of other black hole parameters. To further probe the observational features of the scalar hair, we simulate face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks, examining how the primary scalar hair affects the black hole's shadow. Finally, we impose all relevant constraints to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <title>A targeted search for strongly lensed supernovae with the Las Cumbres Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are of interest for time delay cosmology and SN physics. However, glSNe detections are rare, owing to the intrinsic rarity of SN explosions, the necessity of alignment with a foreground lens, and the relatively short window of detectability. We present the Las Cumbres Observatory Lensed Supernova Search, LCOLSS, a targeted survey designed for detecting glSNe in known strong lensing systems. Using cadenced r'-band imaging, LCOLSS targeted 114 galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with high expected SN rates, based on estimated star formation rates. No plausible glSN was detected by LCOLSS during our two year observing program. We carry out an analysis here to measure a detection efficiency for these observations. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations using the predicted supernova rates to determine the expected number of glSN detections. The results of the simulation suggest an expected number of detections and $68\%$ Poisson confidence intervals, $N_{SN} = 0.20, [0,2.1] $, $N_{Ia} = 0.08, [0,2.0]$, $N_{CC} = 0.12, [0,2.0]$, for all SNe, Type Ia SNe, and core-collapse (CC) SNe respectively. These results are broadly consistent with the absence of a detection in our survey. Analysis of the survey strategy can provide insights for future efforts to develop targeted glSN discovery programs, especially considering the large anticipated yields of upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the early universe's equation of state and primordial black hole production with PTA, BBN, and CMB observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics with High-Redshift Quasars: Axions and Non-standard Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble diagram of quasars, as candidates to ``standardizable" candles, has been used to measure the expansion history of the Universe at late times, up to very high redshifts ($z \sim 7$). It has been shown that this history, as inferred from the quasar dataset, deviates at $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ level from the concordance ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology model preferred by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other datasets. In this article, we investigate whether new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM (B$\Lambda$CDM) or beyond the Standard Model (BSM) could make the quasar data consistent with the concordance model. We first show that an effective redshift-dependent relation between the quasar UV and X-ray luminosities, complementing previous phenomenological work in the literature, can potentially remedy the discrepancy. Such a redshift dependence can be realized in a BSM model with axion-photon conversion in the intergalactic medium (IGM), although the preferred parameter space is {in tension with various other astrophysical constraints on axions, at a level} depending on the specific assumptions made regarding the IGM magnetic field. We briefly discuss a variation of the axion model that could evade these astrophysical constraints. On the other hand, we show that models beyond $\Lambda$CDM such as one with a varying dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM) or the phenomenological cosmographic model with a polynomial expansion of the luminosity distance, cannot alleviate the tension. The code for our analysis, based on \texttt{emcee}~\cite{Foreman_Mackey_2013} and \texttt{corner.py}~\cite{corner}, is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/ChenSun-Phys/high\_z\_candles.git}{{\tt github.com/ChenSun-Phys/high\_z\_candles}}.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Model For Intrinsic Alignments: Insights From Cosmological Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend current models of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to include a flexible, empirical framework for the forward modeling of the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies. A primary goal of this work is to produce mock galaxy catalogs for the purpose of validating existing models and methods for the mitigation of IA in weak lensing measurements. This technique can also be used to produce new, simulation-based predictions for IA and galaxy clustering. Our model is probabilistically formulated, and rests upon the assumption that the orientations of galaxies exhibit a correlation with their host dark matter (sub)halo orientation or with their position within the halo. We examine the necessary components and phenomenology of such a model by considering the alignments between (sub)halos in a cosmological dark matter only simulation. We then validate this model for a realistic galaxy population in a set of simulations in the IllustrisTNG suite. We create an HOD mock with TNG-like correlations using our method, constraining the associated IA model parameters, with the $\chi^2_{\rm dof}$ between our model's correlations and those of Illustris matching as closely as 1.4 and 1.1 for orientation--position and orientation--orientation correlation functions, respectively. By modeling the misalignment between galaxies and their host halo, we show that the 3-dimensional two-point position and orientation correlation functions of simulated (sub)halos and galaxies can be accurately reproduced from quasi-linear scales down to $0.1~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We also find evidence for environmental influence on IA within a halo. Our publicly-available software provides a key component enabling efficient determination of Bayesian posteriors on IA model parameters using observational measurements of galaxy-orientation correlation functions in the highly nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Cosmological Parameter Estimation to Nonlinear Prescription from Cosmic Shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several ongoing and upcoming large scale structure surveys aim to explore the nonlinear regime of structure formation with high precision. Making reliable cosmological inferences from these observations necessitates precise theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this work we explore how the choice of nonlinear prescription would impact parameter estimation from cosmic shear measurements for a Euclid-like survey. Specifically, we employ two different nonlinear prescriptions of Haloft and the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure and compare their measurements for the three different cosmological scenarios of $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $(w_0,w_a)$CDM. We also investigate the impact of different nonlinear cutoff schemes on parameter estimation. We find that the predicted errors on most parameters shrink considerably as smaller scales are included in the analysis, with the amount depending on the nonlinear prescription and the cutoff scheme used. We use predictions from the Halofit model to analyze the mock data from DarkSky $N$-body simulations and quantify the parameter bias introduced in the measurements due to the choice of nonlinear prescription. We observe that $\sigma_8$ and $n_{\rm{s}}$ have the largest measurement bias induced by inaccuracies of the Halofit model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmological analyses it is common to combine different types of measurement from the same survey. In this paper we use simulated DES Y3 and LSST Y1 data to explore differences in sensitivity to intrinsic alignments (IA) between cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We generate mock shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering data, contaminated with a range of IA scenarios. Using a simple 2-parameter IA model (NLA) in a DES Y3 like analysis, we show that the galaxy-galaxy lensing + galaxy clustering combination ($2\times2$pt) is significantly more robust to IA mismodelling than cosmic shear. IA scenarios that produce up to $5\sigma$ biases for shear are seen to be unbiased at the level of $\sim1\sigma$ for $2\times2$pt. We demonstrate that this robustness can be largely attributed to the redshift separation in galaxy-galaxy lensing, which provides a cleaner separation of lensing and IA contributions. We identify secondary factors which may also contribute, including the possibility of cancellation of higher-order IA terms in $2\times2$pt and differences in sensitivity to physical scales. Unfortunately this does not typically correspond to equally effective self-calibration in a $3\times2$pt analysis of the same data, which can show significant biases driven by the cosmic shear part of the data vector. If we increase the precision of our mock analyses to a level roughly equivalent to LSST Y1, we find a similar pattern, with considerably more bias in a cosmic shear analysis than a $2\times2$pt one, and significant bias in a joint analysis of the two. Our findings suggest that IA model error can manifest itself as internal tension between $\xi_\pm$ and $\gamma_t + w$ data vectors. We thus propose that such tension (or the lack thereof) can be employed as a test of model sufficiency or insufficiency when choosing a fiducial IA model, alongside other data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Witt's hyperbola is both predicted and observed to pass close to the lensing galaxies in quadruple quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a rectangular hyperbola is constructed from the image positions of a quadruply lensed quasar, as proposed by Witt (1996), it passes very close to the the lensing galaxy. The median measured perpendicular offset between the observed light center of the lens and Witt's hyperbola is 0.013" for a sample for 39 systems lensed by a relatively isolated galaxy. The family of lens models adopted by Witt predicts that the lens lies on the hyperbola, but its position in not used for its construction. The median offset corresponds to roughly 1% of the Einstein ring radius, and suggests that the centers of the lensing potential are close to the light centers of the lens. By putting a restrictive prior on the perpendicular distance to Witt's hyperbola (or on the distance between the galaxy and the potential), one reduces by one the dimensionality of a model space when fitting data. Taking the brightest pixel of a lensing galaxy as its center avoids a shortcoming of using the average light center for a constraint.</description>

      <title>Late-end reionization with ATON-HE: towards constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new suite of late-end reionization simulations performed with ATON-HE, a revised version of the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON that includes helium. The simulations are able to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ flux distribution of the E-XQR-30 sample of QSO absorption spectra at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$, and show that a large variety of reionization models are consistent with these data. We explore a range of variations in source models and in the early-stage evolution of reionization. Our fiducial reionization history has a midpoint of reionization at $z = 6.5$, but we also explore an `Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 7.5$ and an `Extremely Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 9.5$. Haloes massive enough to host observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters are highly biased. The fraction of such haloes embedded in ionized bubbles that are large enough to allow high Ly$\alpha$ transmission becomes close to unity much before the volume filling factor of ionized regions. For our fiducial reionization history this happens at $z = 8$, probably too late to be consistent with the detection by JWST of abundant Ly$\alpha$ emission out to $z = 11$. A reionization history in our `Early' model or perhaps even our `Extremely Early' model may be required, suggesting a Thomson scattering optical depth in tension with that reported by Planck, but consistent with recent suggestions of a significantly higher value.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Combining cross-spectral foreground cleaning with multitracer $B$-mode delensing for improved constraints on inflation</title>

Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO), due to start full science operations in early 2025, aims to set tight constraints on inflationary physics by inferring the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from measurements of CMB polarization $B$-modes. Its nominal design targets a precision $\sigma(r=0) \leq 0.003$ without delensing. Achieving this goal and further reducing uncertainties requires the mitigation of other sources of large-scale $B$-modes such as Galactic foregrounds and weak gravitational lensing. We present an analysis pipeline aiming to estimate $r$ by including delensing within a cross-spectral likelihood, and demonstrate it on SO-like simulations. Lensing $B$-modes are synthesised using internal CMB lensing reconstructions as well as Planck-like CIB maps and LSST-like galaxy density maps. This $B$-mode template is then introduced into SO's power-spectrum-based foreground-cleaning algorithm by extending the likelihood function to include all auto- and cross-spectra between the lensing template and the SAT $B$-modes. Within this framework, we demonstrate the equivalence of map-based and cross-spectral delensing and use it to motivate an optimized pixel-weighting scheme for power spectrum estimation. We start by validating our pipeline in the simplistic case of uniform foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the absence of primordial $B$-modes, $\sigma(r)$ decreases by 37% as a result of delensing. Tensor modes at the level of $r=0.01$ are successfully detected by our pipeline. Even with more realistic foreground models including spatial variations in the dust and synchrotron spectral properties, we obtain unbiased estimates of $r$ by employing the moment-expansion method. In this case, delensing-related improvements range between 27% and 31%. These results constitute the first realistic assessment of the delensing performance at SO's nominal sensitivity level.

      <title>DESI Dark Energy Time Evolution is Recovered by Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide evidence that dark energy (DE) evolves with time, as parameterized by a $w_0 w_a$ equation of state. Cosmologically coupled black holes (BHs) provide a DE source that naturally evolves with time, because BH production tracks cosmic star-formation. Using DESI BAO measurements and priors informed by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we measure the fraction of baryonic density converted into BHs, assuming that all DE is sourced by BH production. We find that the best-fit DE density tracks each DESI best-fit $w_0w_a$ model within $1\sigma$, except at redshifts $z \lesssim 0.2$, highlighting limitations of the $w_0w_a$ parameterization. Cosmologically coupled BHs produce $H_0 = (69.94 \pm 0.81)~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program, with the same $\chi^2$ as $\Lambda$CDM, and with two fewer parameters than $w_0w_a$. Because cosmologically coupled BH production depletes the baryon density established by primordial nucleosynthesis, these BHs provide a physical explanation for the ``missing baryon problem'' and the anomalously low sum of neutrino masses preferred by DESI. The global evolution of DE is an orthogonal probe of cosmological coupling, complementing constraints on BH mass-growth from elliptical galaxies, stellar binaries, globular clusters, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA merging population, and X-ray binaries. A DE density that correlates with cosmic star-formation: 1) is a natural outcome of cosmological coupling in BH populations; 2) eases tension between early and late-time cosmological probes; and 3) produces time-evolution toward a late-time $\Lambda$CDM cosmology different from Cosmic Microwave Background projections.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Precision Cosmology and Testing General Relativity using Binary Black Holes- Galaxies Cross-correlation</title>

Abstract: Modified theories of gravity predict deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) across cosmological distances. A key prediction is that the GW luminosity distance will vary with redshift, differing from the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance due to varying effective Planck mass. We introduce a model-independent, data-driven approach to explore these deviations using multi-messenger observations of dark standard sirens (Binary Black Holes, BBH). By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from dark sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, BBH redshifts inferred from cross-correlation with spectroscopic or photometric galaxy surveys, and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven test of GR (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of redshift. Using the multi-messenger technique with the spectroscopic DESI galaxy survey, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift. For the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (CEET), the best precision is approximately 3.6\%, and for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), it is 7.4\% at a redshift of $\rm{z = 0.425}$. Additionally, we can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about 1.1\% from CEET and 7\% from LVK over five years of observation with a 75\% duty cycle. We also explore the potential of cross-correlation with photometric galaxy surveys from the Rubin Observatory, extending measurements up to a redshift of $\rm{z \sim 2.5}$. This approach can reveal potential deviations from models affecting GW propagation using numerous dark standard sirens in synergy with DESI and the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Things that might go bump in the night: Assessing structure in the binary black hole mass spectrum</title>

Abstract: Several features in the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes (BBHs) have been identified using data from the Third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). These features are of particular interest as they may encode the uncertain mechanism of BBH formation. We assess if the features are statistically significant or the result of Poisson noise due to the finite number of observed events. We simulate catalogs of BBHs whose underlying distribution does not have the features of interest, apply the analysis previously performed on GWTC-3, and determine how often such features are spuriously found. We find that one of the features found in GWTC-3, the peak at $\sim35\,M_{\odot}$, cannot be explained by Poisson noise alone: peaks as significant occur in $1.7\%$ of catalogs generated from a featureless population. This peak is therefore likely to be of astrophysical origin. The data is suggestive of an additional significant peak at $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$, though the exact location of this feature is not resolvable with current observations. Additional structure beyond a power law, such as the purported dip at $\sim14\,M_{\odot}$, can be explained by Poisson noise. We also provide a publicly-available package, \texttt{GWMockCat}, that creates simulated catalogs of BBH events with correlated measurement uncertainty and selection effects according to user-specified underlying distributions and detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>A core in a star-forming disc as evidence of inside-out growth in the early Universe</title>

Abstract: The physical processes that establish the morphological evolution and the structural diversity of galaxies are key unknowns in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we report the finding of the morphologically-mature galaxy JADES-GS+53.18343-27.79097, which existed within the first 700 million years of the Universe's history. This star-forming galaxy with a stellar mass of 400 million solar masses consists of three components, a highly-compact core with a half-light radius of less than 100 pc, an actively star-forming disc with a radius of about 400 pc, and a star-forming clump, which all show distinctive star-formation histories. The central stellar mass density of this galaxy is within a factor of two of the most massive present-day ellipticals, while being globally 1000 times less massive. The radial profile of the specific star-formation rate is rising toward the outskirts. This evidence suggests the first detection of inside-out growth of a galaxy as a proto-bulge and a star-forming disc in the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference of Reionization Parameters from 3D Tomographic 21 cm Light-cone Images -- II: Application of Solid Harmonic Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information regarding how the intergalactic medium is reionized by astrophysical sources is contained in the tomographic three-dimensional 21 cm images from the epoch of reionization. In Zhao et al. (2022a) ("Paper I"), we demonstrated for the first time that density estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) can be applied efficiently to perform a Bayesian inference of the reionization parameters from the 21 cm images. Nevertheless, the 3D image data needs to be compressed into informative summaries as the input of DELFI by, e.g., a trained 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as in Paper I (DELFI-3D CNN). Here in this paper, we introduce an alternative data compressor, the solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform (WST), which has a similar, yet fixed (i.e. no training), architecture to CNN, but we show that this approach (i.e. solid harmonic WST with DELFI) outperforms earlier analyses based on 3D 21 cm images using DELFI-3D CNN in terms of credible regions of parameters. Realistic effects, including thermal noise and residual foreground after removal, are also applied to the mock observations from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We show that under the same inference strategy using DELFI, the 21 cm image analysis with solid harmonic WST outperforms the 21 cm power spectrum analysis. This research serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential to harness the strengths of WST and simulation-based inference to derive insights from future 21 cm light-cone image data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra large enough to produce primordial black holes in models with multiple scalar fields. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. We derive the criteria for an arbitrary number of fields that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results to a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light'' scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of supermassive black holes surrounded by dark matter halo has attracted a great number of interests in recent years. However, many studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it very hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real astrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the distribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the gravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models (Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using a generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the Einstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation. Specifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples, including the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results suggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has non-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and gravitational lensing observations. However, the Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore models have relatively small influences on angular position of images and the Einstein ring.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>
