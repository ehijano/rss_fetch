      <title>3D insights into SN 1987A: ALMA observations compared to hydrodynamical explosion simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain three-dimensional distributions of CO and SiO molecules from high spatial resolution (0.03--0.06") ALMA observations of SN 1987A at two different epochs. The evolution between these two epochs is consistent with homologous expansion. From these 3D maps, we reconstruct the 3D mass distributions of the ejecta in CO and SiO molecules, which we compare with those obtained by state-of-the-art, long-time hydrodynamical supernova explosion models computed with the Prometheus-HotB code for 10 different progenitors, including both red and blue supergiants. The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick. If such a correlation also applies to the CO emission in the ejecta of SN 1987A, the kick of the compact remnant is expected to point towards the observer, at an angle of approximately $45^\circ$ to the north.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 from Aqueye+ and NICER observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are old neutron stars spun up by accretion from a low-mass companion. These objects can switch between two emission regimes: rotation-powered radio pulsar and accreting X-ray pulsar. The origin of their optical and X-ray pulsations is still debated, although one model attributes them to synchrotron emission produced in a shock between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow. The small phase lag observed between optical and X-ray pulses in PSR J1023+0038 supports a common origin. We present a new measurement of the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulse profiles of PSR J1023+0038 and investigate the evolution of the time of passage at the ascending node ($T_{\rm{asc}}$) up to 2023. We performed a timing analysis of optical observations obtained with Aqueye+ between 2021 and 2023 and of X-ray data from NICER in 2023. We derive updated values of $T_{\rm{asc}}$ and measure the optical - X-ray phase lag from simultaneous observations. We find that $T_{\rm{asc}}$ increases by about 20 s per year. In January 2023, we measure a phase lag of $0.067 \pm 0.018$, corresponding to $112.3 \pm 30.7\,\mu$s. Since 2017, the evolution of $T_{\rm{asc}}$ follows a parabolic trend, indicating an increase in the orbital period and orbital separation of the system. This behaviour is consistent with non-conservative Roche-lobe overflow, with the donor losing mass at a rate much higher than the accretion rate. The phase lag measurement further supports a common origin of the optical and X-ray pulsations.</description>

      <title>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</description>

      <title>Unification Model of Active Galactic Nuclei by Photoionization Equilibrium Calculation Based on Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the origin of the dependence of the covering factor on the Eddington ratio suggested by X-ray observations, we examined the angular distribution of HI and HII based on two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) The Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI has the same value as $C_{22}$ of HI. (3) Our $C_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from X-ray observations. (4) Our $C_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from X-ray observations in a high Eddington ratio, while our $C_{22}$ is smaller than that from X-ray observations in a low Eddington ratio. (5) To explain the difference between $C_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from X-ray observations, a Compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.</description>

      <title>Searching for Anisotropy in the Gravitational Wave Background Using the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several pulsar timing array collaborations have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB). Such a background signal could be produced by supermassive binary black holes, early-Universe processes such as inflation and phase transitions, or a mixture of both. One way to disentangle different contributions to the GWB is to search for anisotropic signatures. In this work, we search for anisotropy in the GWB using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Our analysis employs both the radiometer method and the spherical harmonic basis to characterize the distribution of GWB power across the sky. We calculate the angular power in the lowest five frequency bins and compare it with detection thresholds determined under the null hypothesis of isotropy. In the 5.26 nHz frequency bin, we identify a hotspot in the reconstructed sky map with a $p$-value of $0.016$ (the lowest in our analysis), which we attribute to noise fluctuations. While our search reveals no statistically significant anisotropy, we expect that the precise measurement of angular power spectrum of the GWB will become instrumental in determining the origin of the nanohertz GWB signal.</description>

      <title>Understanding coronal geometry in NGC 4593 using Fourier frequency-resolved covariance and time-lag spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding disc-corona geometry through X-ray reverberation variability studies in Seyfert galaxies is crucial, yet our knowledge mostly relies on flux-averaged mean spectral analysis. In this study, we investigate the origin of the large X-ray variability of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 using two \xmm{} observations, which are at least 65 ksec long and have a 0.3-10 keV X-ray flux difference by a factor of $\sim$2.5. We extracted mean spectra, Fourier-frequency resolved covariance, and time-lag spectra and performed modelling of all spectra in a self-consistent manner. From the best-fit covariance spectra, we have shown that energy-dependent covariance during low flux shows dominances of direct powerlaw continuum over reflection continuum at all Fourier frequencies (2.1 $-$ 390 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ Hz). However, during high flux, the variabilities are dominated by the reflection components most of the time. Our results are further supported by the Fourier frequency-dependent time-lag (between soft: 0.3-1 keV and hard: 1-5 keV bands) spectral modeling during high and low fluxes. A significant change is observed in the X-ray reverberation delay timescale from 483 $\pm$ 135 sec (during high flux) to $&lt;$96 sec (during low flux), indicating a change in coronal size at least by a factor of $\sim$2 (from $&lt;$3.3 R$_g$ to $&gt;$7.2 R$_g$) during low to high flux transitions.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis predictions of the Galactic compact binary gravitational wave foreground detectable by LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use population synthesis modelling to predict the gravitational wave (GW) signal that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect from the Galactic population of compact binary systems. We implement a realistic star formation history with time and position-dependent metallicity, and account for the effect of supernova kicks on present-day positions. We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $&gt;2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $\alpha$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\mathcal{M} &lt; M_\odot$ to those with $\mathcal{M} \geqslant M_\odot$ increases with $\alpha$. We therefore conclude that LISA may be able to diagnose the CE efficiency, which is currently poorly constrained.</description>

      <title>Impact of crust-core connection procedures on the tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of crust-core connection procedures on various neutron-star properties, especially on the tidal deformability. We consider three types of connection procedures to treat the discontinuity in a nonunified equation of state around the crust-core transition: (1) the direct connection procedure, (2) the crossover connection procedure, and (3) the segmented method. Our results indicate that the mass-radius relations of neutron stars are almost unaffected by the details of the connection procedure. However, the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars are sensitive to the crust-core connection procedures. The tidal deformability is closely related to gravitational-wave measurements. For a canonical 1.4$M_\odot$ neutron star, uncertainties in the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ from different connection procedures can exceed 20\%. We find that the direct connection procedure yields significantly larger uncertainties in the tidal deformability, while the segmented method and crossover connection procedure provide relatively stable results.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the upper atmospheric temperature and interplanetary magnetic field with the GRAPES-3 muon telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) have to travel through the heliosphere before they interact with the Earth's atmosphere. During this, they are deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, causing variations in this field to imprint on the flux, spectrum and angular distribution of GCRs detected at or near Earth. Studies of these variations over the past several decades have revealed the impact of both transient phenomena such as solar flares, coronal holes, sunspot activity and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as their effects such as Forbush Decreases (FDs), precursors and Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs). Periodic variations, such as due to the solar diurnal modulation, the 27-day solar rotation, the 11-year solar cycle, and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle have also been characterized. These Sun-induced phenomena are most prominent in GCR intensity variations up to $\sim$30 GeV/nuc, beyond which the influence of solar modulation decreases rapidly as the gyro-radii of GCRs exceed the characteristic size of the heliosphere ($\sim$100 AU).</description>

      <title>Spectro-timing origin of large amplitude X-ray variability in GRS 1915+105 using AstroSat/LAXPC and SXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the large-amplitude, quasi-periodic X-ray flux variations in several classes of the Galactic microquasar GRS~1915+105 remains unresolved. We address this issue through flux-resolved, broadband (0.8-20 keV) spectral modelling and simultaneous covariance spectral analysis during two $\kappa$ and two $\omega$ class observations using \textit{AstroSat}/SXT and LAXPC. The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally. The combined results suggest that radiation-pressure-driven structural changes in the disc, with a slower coronal response, produce the observed oscillations, consistent with cyclic disc evacuation and refilling in the $\kappa$ and $\omega$ classes.</description>

      <title>The Interstellar Scintillation of the Radio-Loud Magnetar XTE J1810-197</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive interstellar scintillation (ISS) study of the radio-loud magnetar XTE~J1810$-$197, based on six years of multi-frequency monitoring (2018$-$2024) with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT) at 7.0, 8.6, and 14.0~GHz. The scintillation parameters--decorrelation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_{\rm d}$, decorrelation time $\Delta\tau_{\rm d}$, and drift rate $dt/d\nu$--are fully characterized. Our measured $\Delta\tau_{\rm d}$ implies $\Delta\tau_{\rm d} &lt; 4$~s at 575-725~MHz under a Kolmogorov spectrum, which is shorter than the magnetar's 5.54~s spin period. This result naturally explains the previously reported absence of pulse-to-pulse coherence at these frequencies. Kinematic modeling locates the dominant scattering screen at $1.6\pm0.1$~kpc away from the Earth, within the Sagittarius Arm. The screen coincides with the HII region JCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932 and is unrelated to the magnetar's 2018 outburst suggested by earlier studies. A scintillation arc detected at 14.0~GHz represents the highest-frequency arc observed to date. The asymmetry of arcs is linearly correlated with a dispersion-measure gradient across the screen ($r = 0.959$, $p &lt; 10^{-8}$). We also measure its refractive scintillation timescale, which is only $1.21\pm0.19$~d. Clear DISS at 14~GHz effectively resolves the debate over a possible strong-to-weak scattering transition at this frequency. These results extend the ISS characterization of magnetars to previously unexplored frequencies and provide a precise probe of the ionized interstellar medium in the Sagittarius Arm.</description>

      <title>Search for Sub-Solar Mass Binaries in the First Part of LIGO's Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first results of a sub-solar mass compact binary search using the data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the Advanced LIGO detectors. Sub-solar mass neutron stars or primordial black holes are not expected to form via standard stellar evolution, and their observation would signify a new class of astrophysical object or the discovery of dark matter. Our search covers binaries with primary masses 0.1 to 2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ and secondary masses 0.1 to 1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We explicitly incorporate tidal effects up to $7\times10^5$ for extremely low mass neutron stars. No statistically significant candidates are identified. The advanced sensitivity of the O4a run enables an improvement in the sub-solar mass black hole merger rate limits by more than $2 \times$ over the previous three observing runs (O1-O3b). We place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the merger rate $\mathcal{R}_{90}$ for sub-solar mass black holes to be $&lt; 1.77\times10^4 \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We place the first constraints for binary neutron stars with tidal deformabilities up to $\sim 7\times10^5$ and improve the merger rate estimate by a factor $\sim 4$ in comparison to previous O3 tidal searches for tidal deformabilities $&lt; 10^4$. We further constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of primordial black hole $f_{\rm PBH}&lt; 2\%$ for a chirp mass of 0.1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. Our results significantly expand the observational search space for sub-solar binaries and provide rigorous constraints on the local abundance of compact objects that may arise from non-standard formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Poloidal Field Amplification through Compression-Shear Dynamics in Schwarzschild Accretion: Pathways to MAD States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows governs key high-energy phenomena such as magnetically arrested disks and relativistic jets. We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($\xi \in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($\xi=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($\xi=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_\theta$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($\xi&lt;1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_\theta$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation. This work provides an analytical bridge between classical accretion theory and modern GRMHD simulations, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGNs, and EHT-scale systems.</description>

      <title>A simple model for extracting astrophysics from black hole images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is providing unprecedented high-resolution images of supermassive black holes. These images are fundamentally related to properties of the luminous accretion disks, since black holes themselves produce no light. We develop a simple prescription to relate observational features of black hole images to a toy model for the intensity profile of the associated accretion disk. We apply our model to the original EHT image of M87*, as well as to the reanalyzed image from the PRIMO algorithm, providing generic, simultaneous constraints on the mass of the black hole and properties of the accretion disk emission. While current images lack the resolution to confidently detect the photon ring, the consideration of multiple image parameters are found to contain enough information to provide constraints on the inner edge of the accretion disk along with the black hole mass. Using observed features of the original EHT image, we constrain the mass of M87* to be $6.6^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\times 10^9 M_\odot$ to 68$\%$ confidence, and find that emission may extend all the way to the black hole horizon. When instead using constraints from the PRIMO algorithm's image along with constraints on the brightness asymmetry provided by the original EHT analysis, we find M87*'s mass to be $ 6.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\times 10^9 M_\odot$ to 68$\%$ confidence, with the inner edge of the accretion disk between $3M$ and $5.3M$. Both analyses rule out an inner edge of the accretion disk coinciding with the innermost stable circular orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the narrow ring width reported in the PRIMO image also confidently rules out emission increasing all the way down to the black hole horizon. Further assumptions on the mass of M87* and connections between the accretion disk cutoff and physical radii allow for rudimentary black hole spin estimates.</description>

      <title>The Wandering Supermassive Black Hole Powering the off-nuclear TDE AT2024tvd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2024tvd during its late-time plateau phase, combining X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry. Using a fully relativistic, compact accretion disk model with self-consistent inner-disk Comptonization, we reproduce the observed SED without significant residuals. The inferred black hole mass ${\rm log}{10}(M{\bullet}/M_\odot) \approx 6.0 \pm 0.2$, and the inferred disk parameters place AT2024tvd within known TDE-disk scaling relations ($L_{\rm bol}^{\rm disk}/L_{\rm Edd} \propto T_{\rm p}^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$, $L_{\rm plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$, $R_{\rm out}/r_{\rm g} \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$). Our results show that: (i) there is no \textit{detected} star cluster or dwarf galaxy associated with the source, down to a mass limit of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm gal}/M_{\odot}) \leq 7.6$; (ii) the black hole is a wandering supermassive, rather than intermediate-mass, black hole; and (iii) the source represents an extreme case of black hole-to-host mass ratio, with $M_{\bullet}/M_{\rm gal} &gt; 3\%$, consistent with a heavily tidally stripped nucleus. The latter aligns with cosmological simulations predicting that surviving host remnants of most wandering black holes should not retain a detectable stellar overdensity when located at small halo-centric distances. We discuss differences with previous analyses of this source and highlight why our modeling approach provides a more physically consistent solution with more reliable parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous yet forgotten: broad absorptions in the optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical outburst spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries enable studies of extreme accretion and ejection phenomena. While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than &lt; 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a background rotation significantly catalyzes the chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral magnetohydrodynamics. The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas.</description>

      <title>BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$\sigma$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$\sigma$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>The Curious Case of Centaurus A II: On the Subject of the Quenched satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d&lt;150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv &lt; -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z &lt; 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the "Curious Case of Centaurus A" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.</description>

      <title>Filling The Pockets: The Spherical Nature of 3D Deflagration in Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.</description>

      <title>An optical transient candidate of $\lesssim$ 2-second duration captured by wide-field video observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent time-domain surveys have revealed rapid transients that evolve on timescales of $\lesssim 10$ days, expanding the transient population into the short-duration regime. The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\mathrm{s} \leq \tau \lesssim 15~\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} \lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case. We highlight that continuous monitoring observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow could be a key strategy to unveil a new population of optical transients on timescales of seconds or less.</description>

      <title>NE2025: An Updated Electron Density Model for the Galactic Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) disperse and scatter coherent radio waves, by amounts that depend on the distance to the radio source. Models of the Galactic electron density are thus widely used to predict distances and scattering of compact radio sources (including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), and long-period transients), in addition to mitigating ISM foregrounds in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We use a sample of 171 precise pulsar distances, based entirely on parallaxes and globular cluster associations, as well as scattering measurements of 568 pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and masers, to update the NE2001 Galactic electron density model. We refit the thick and thin disks and three of the spiral arms. The new parameters for these large-scale components significantly repartition free electrons between the thick disk and spiral arms, thereby correcting NE2001's systematic underestimation of pulsar distance and scattering. Sightlines with excessive dispersion and scattering are used to identify new clumps that are added to the model, in addition to refining clumps that were already included (e.g., Cygnus, Vela, and Gum). The Galactic Center component is revised, yielding scattering time predictions that are $10^3$ times smaller than the Galactic Center in NE2001. The updated model, NE2025, provides a factor of $20\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy and $100\%$ median improvement in scattering predictions based on DM, relative to NE2001. There is a $15\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy relative to YMW16. NE2025 is available on Github and the Python Package Interface.</description>

      <title>Disappearance of a massive star in the Andromeda Galaxy due to formation of a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a massive star reaches the end of its lifetime, its core collapses and releases neutrinos that drive a shock into the outer layers (stellar envelope). A sufficiently strong shock ejects the envelope, producing a supernova. If the shock fails to eject it, the envelope is predicted to fall back onto the collapsing core, producing a stellar-mass black hole (BH) and causing the star to disappear. We report observations of M31-2014-DS1, a hydrogen-depleted supergiant in the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2014 it brightened in the mid-infrared. From 2017 to 2022 it faded by factors of $\gtrsim10^4$ in optical light, becoming undetectable, and $\gtrsim10$ in total light. We interpret these observations, and those of a previous event in NGC 6946, as evidence for failed supernovae forming stellar-mass BHs.</description>

Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>A possible origin of the overlapping light curve of eRO-QPE1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are recurrent X-ray eruptions discovered so far in the nuclei of low-mass galaxies. However, despite considerable observational progress, the origin of QPEs remains unclear. A variety of models have been proposed to explain their nature, but a definitive understanding has yet to be reached. Recently, chaotic mixtures of multiple overlapping eruptions with varying amplitudes have been observed in eRO-QPE1 obs1-features not reported in any other known QPE sources. This complex behavior presents a challenge to the existing QPE models. In this paper, we propose that the overlapping features may be the result of gravitational lensing. We analyze the light curve of eRO-QPE1 and compare its features to predictions from gravitational lensing scenarios. We discuss the implications for the trigger mechanism of QPEs in general. We show that the unique overlapping features observed in eRO-QPE1 may be naturally reproduced by gravitational lensing effects, without invoking a different physical origin from other known QPE sources.</description>

      <title>Constraining Super-Heavy Dark Matter with the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.</description>

      <title>The strong Fe K line and spin of the black-hole X-ray binary MAXI J1631-479</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>Are NICER and GW170817 constraints suggesting a compactified scenario for Neutron stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations from NICER and gravitational wave data constrain the properties of matter at the cores of neutron stars, enabling us to probe high-density matter with greater accuracy. To understand its implications for neutron stars, three distinct class-agnostic equation-of-state ensembles are constructed using the speed-of-sound parametrisation, which can describe matter in neutron-star cores. Bayesian analysis is employed to constrain the parameters, namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential, using the observational data. The Bayesian inference shows that the observations effectively constrain the low-density region of the equation of state. The astrophysical bound favours a softer, low-density equation of state in which the phase transition occurs at intermediate densities, thereby reducing the upper mass bounds for neutron stars. For the equation of state with density discontinuity, the discontinuities are preferably small. The equation of state with maximum mass configuration shows considerable stiffening from very low density, providing pressure support to generate maximum mass. In contrast, the equation of state with the maximum compact stellar configuration has a softer low-density equation of state, followed by pronounced stiffening, yielding the maximum compact configuration. The observationally favoured EoS shares the same qualitative structure as the maximum-compactness EoS: relative softness at intermediate densities transitioning to stiffness at high densities, a configuration gravity naturally favours.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. 2025, I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $\propto k^{3/4}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criterion for this process, revealing that young SNRs with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. 2025, this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>The collision and merger products of stars do not look alike: A magnetohydrodynamics comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in different long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.</description>

      <title>GRHayL: a modern, infrastructure-agnostic, extensible library for GRMHD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting multimessenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable point- and stencilwise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and Carpetx) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.</description>
