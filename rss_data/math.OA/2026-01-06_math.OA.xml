      <title>Quantum graphs and spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantize the regularity properties of classical graphs that determine spin models for singly-generated Yang-Baxter planar algebras, including the Kauffman polynomial, and construct explicit examples. A source of examples comes from deforming graphs using higher-idempotent splittings of quantum isomorphisms for which we prove that the relevant algebraic, combinatorial, and topological properties of the original graphs are preserved along with the quantum automorphism group. We also obtain exotic examples of highly regular quantum graphs using the quantum Fourier transform and a method of iterated convolution. Our examples include quantum versions of the strongly regular 9-Paley, 16-Clebsch and the Higman-Sims graphs, yielding new models for their regularity parameters. As applications, we construct a compact quantum group with property (T) that is monoidally equivalent to SO_q(5) at the square of the golden ratio, and exhibit a highly-regular quantum graph with no classical analogue. Finally, we introduce quantum spin models, construct explicit examples and make contact with quantum Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $C^*$-algebra of a countable directed graph is singly generated. As a consequence, any $C^*$-algebra generated by a countable family of projections and partial isometries satisfying Cuntz-Krieger relations is singly generated.</description>

      <title>Completely Bounded Representations Into Von Neumann Algebras And Connes Embedding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital separable $C^*$-algebra, $\mathcal{M}$ is a von Neumann algebra which has the Kirchberg's quotient weak expectation property (QWEP), and $\phi:\, \mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ is a unital completely bounded representation, then there is an invertible operator $S\in \mathcal{M}$ such that $S\phi(\cdot) S^{-1}$ is a $\ast$-representation. On the other hand, Gilles Pisier proved the following result: a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is nuclear if and only if for every unital completely bounded representation $\phi$ of $\mathcal{A}$ into an arbitrary von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ there is an invertible operator $S\in \mathcal{M}$ such that $S\phi(\cdot) S^{-1}$ is a $\ast$-representation. This implies that there exist von Neumann algebras which are not QWEP. Eberhard Kirchberg showed that every von Neumann algebra has QWEP if and only if every tracial von Neumann algebra embeds into the ultrapower $\mathcal{R}^w$ of the hyperfinite type ${\rm II}_1$ factor $\mathcal{R}$. This provides a negative answer to the Connes Embedding Problem. This paper relies on previous work of Gilles Pisier and Florin Pop.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Unital Classification Theorem for $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the $KK$-equivalence relation on unital $C^*$-algebras, in the sense of descriptive set theory. We prove that $KK$-equivalence is analytic, which in turn shows that the set of separable $C^*$-algebras satisfying the UCT is analytic. This allows us to prove a game-theoretic refinement of the unital classification theorem: there is a transfer of strategies between Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games (of various lengths) on classifiable $C^*$-algebras and their invariants.</description>

      <title>Lamperti Operators, Dilation Theory, and Applications in Noncommutative Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel framework for quantitative mean ergodic theorems in the noncommutative setting, with a focus on actions of amenable groups and semigroups. We prove square function inequalities for ergodic averages arising from actions of groups of polynomial volume growth on a fixed noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\8$. To achieve this, we establish two endpoint estimates for a noncommutative square function on non-homogeneous space. Our approach relies on semi-commutative non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, including the non-doubling Calder\'on-Zygmund arguments for non-smooth kernels and $\mathrm{BMO}$ space theory, operator-valued inequalities related to balls and cubes in groups equipped with non-doubling measures, and a noncommutative generalization of the classical transference method for amenable group actions. As an application, we establish a quantitative ergodic theorem for the ergodic averages associated with the positive power of modulus representation arising from a Lamperti representation on noncommutative $L_p$-spaces, extending some results in \cite{Templeman2015}. To obtain quantitative ergodic theorem for semigroups of operators, in this paper, we address the open question of extending dilation theorem of Fackler-Gl\"uck from single operators to commuting tuples on Banach spaces including noncommutative $L_p$-spaces. Indeed our approach provides genuine joint $N$-dilations for commuting families, unifying and extending the classical dilation theorems of Sz.-Nagy--Foia\c{s} and Ak\c{c}oglu--Sucheston for a natural class of commuting tuple of contractions extending the abstract dilation theorem of of Fackler-Gl\"uck for commuting tuple of contractions. This enables us to obtain a quantitative ergodic theorem for a large class of semigroups of operators on $\mathbb{R}^d_{+}$.</description>

      <title>Defect Cocycles and the Structure of Finite Process Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study positive subunital maps on ordered effect spaces and introduce the defect $d(T) = u - T(u)$, which satisfies a cocycle identity under composition. Using only this identity and elementary order-theoretic arguments -- requiring no spectral decomposition or dimension-dependent techniques -- we prove that in any finite composition-closed family of positive subunital maps, defects are eventually annihilated under iteration (Theorem 4.1), with an explicit bound linear in the family size. Under a persistence hypothesis (nonzero positive elements map to nonzero positive elements), we establish that all maps in such families must be unital. For completely positive maps on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, we then prove a sharp dimension-dependent bound: the stabilization index satisfies $n_T \le d$ where $d$ is the Hilbert space dimension, independent of the family size. This bound is achieved by a shift channel construction. These results provide a structural explanation for why finite operational repertoires in process theories cannot sustain systematic information loss, with applications to quantum foundations and categorical probability.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of permuting and preserving curve-bound spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps to $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ from the space of normal (real or complex) $n\times n$, $n\ge 3$ matrices with spectra contained in a given continuous-injection interval image $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ are (a) conjugations; (b) transpose conjugations, or (c) orderings of spectra according to an orientation of $\Lambda$, with fixed eigenspaces. This generalizes results of Petek's (self-maps of real or complex Hermitian matrices) and the author's (complex Hermitian matrices as the domain, $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ as the codomain). An application rules out possibility (c) for normal matrices with spectra constrained to a simple closed curve, extending a result by the author, Gogi\'c and Toma\v{s}evi\'c to the effect that continuous commutativity and spectrum preservers on unitary groups are (transpose) conjugations.
  The involution preserving eigenspaces and complex-conjugating eigenvalues is a novel possibility beyond (a), (b) and (c) if the domain consists of all semisimple operators with $\Lambda$-bound spectra instead; its continuity (or lack thereof) and whether or not that map furthermore extends continuously to arbitrary $\Lambda$-constrained-spectrum matrices hinge on the geometry and regularity of $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Resource-Dependent Complexity of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11304v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>
