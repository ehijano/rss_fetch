      <title>Time Reparametrization, Not Fractional Calculus: A Reassessment of the Conformable Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformable derivative has been promoted in numerous publications as a new fractional derivative operator. This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions of the Navier-Stokes-{\alpha}{\beta} equations with wall-eddy boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global well-posedness and regularity for the Navier-Stokes-{\alpha}{\beta} system endowed with the wall-eddy boundary conditions proposed by Fried and Gurtin (2008). These conditions introduce a tangential vorticity traction proportional to wall vorticity and provide a continuum-mechanical model for near-wall turbulence. Our analysis begins with a variational formulation of the stationary fourth-order system, where we prove symmetry and a G{\aa}rding inequality for the associated bilinear form. We then verify Douglis-Nirenberg ellipticity and the Lopatinskii-Shapiro covering condition, establishing full Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg regularity for the coupled system. Building on this framework, we derive a hierarchy of energy estimates for the nonlinear evolution equation, which yields global regularity, uniqueness, and stability. To our knowledge, this provides the first complete analytical treatment of the wall-eddy boundary model of Fried and Gurtin.</description>

      <title>CR Yamabe Equation on the Heisenberg Group via the method of moving spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify positive solutions to the CR Yamabe equation on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. We show that all such solutions are Jerison-Lee bubbles, without imposing any finite-energy or a priori symmetry assumptions. This result can be regarded as an analogue for $\mathbb{H}^n$ of the celebrated Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck classification theorem in $\mathbb{R}^n$. To establish this, we develop a systematic approach to implement the method of moving spheres in the setting of the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Finite propagation and saturation in reaction-diffusion-advection equations governed by p-Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns front propagation for the following mono-stable reaction-diffusion-advection equation \[f(u)u_x + g(u)u_\tau = [d(u)|u_x|^{p-2} u_x]_x+ \rho(u), \quad (x,\tau)\in \R\times [0,+\infty).\] Besides existence and non-existence results for traveling wave solutions, the main focus is their classification: we provide criteria to establish if they attain one or both the equilibria at a finite time and in this case, if they are continuable as $C^1$-solutions or if they are sharp solutions.</description>

      <title>Wave dynamics governing vortex breakdown in smooth Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in a setting where a vortex is transported by a prescribed Lagrangian flow. We show that vortex breakdown is governed by wave dynamics generated by the underlying transport flow. The key idea is to avoid any singular integral representation of the pressure term and instead construct an effective Lagrangian coordinate system in which the associated Lie bracket vanishes identically.</description>

      <title>The fibre operators in the Bloch-Floquet decomposition of periodic magnetic pseudo-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of the fibre operators corresponding to periodic magnetic pseudo-differential operators having periodic magnetic potentials. We obtain explicit formulas for their distribution kernel, both when these fibres are seen as operators on the $d$-dimensional torus, and also when they are seen as infinite matrices acting on a discrete $\ell^2$ space via a discrete Fourier transform. Moreover, using these distribution kernels we prove that the fibre operators are toroidal pseudo-differential operators.</description>

      <title>On a Thermodynamically Consistent Diffuse-Interface Model for Incompressible Two-Phase Flows with Chemotaxis and Mass Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a hydrodynamic system of Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard type, which describes the motion of a two-phase flow of two incompressible fluids with unmatched densities coupled with a soluble chemical species. Derived from Onsager's variational principle, this thermodynamically consistent diffuse-interface model incorporates both the chemotaxis effects induced by the chemical species and the mass transport processes within the mixture. For the two-dimensional initial-boundary value problem, we establish the existence of global finite energy solutions and global weak solutions, using a suitable approximation scheme combined with compactness methods. Next, by carefully analyzing three decoupled subsystems and employing a bootstrap argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution for sufficiently regular initial data, as well as the propagation of regularity for global weak solutions. In particular, we show that the density of the chemical substance stays bounded for all time if its initial datum is bounded. This implies a significant distinction from the classical Keller--Segel system: diffusion driven by the chemical potential gradient can prevent the formation of concentration singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $\ell^{1}\!\to\!\ell^{\infty}$ dispersive estimates for the discrete Klein--Gordon equation on $\mathbb Z$ with small real-analytic quasi-periodic potentials, showing that the time-decay rate persists as $(\tfrac13)^{-}$. As applications, we derive the corresponding Strichartz estimates and establish small-data global well-posedness for the associated nonlinear discrete Klein--Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>Ground states of the Schr\"odinger equation coupled with fourth-order gravitation -- Part 1: the case $K_{a, b} \leq 0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the existence and asymptotic behavior of ground states of the following normalized nonlocal semilinear problem: \[ \begin{cases} - \Delta u + (V - \omega) u + (K_{a, b} \ast u^2) u = 0 &amp;\text{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^3; \\ \|u\|_{\mathscr{L}^2}^2 = \mu, \end{cases} \] where \[ K_{a, b} (x) := \frac{1}{|x|} \left( \frac{4}{3} e^{- b |x|} - \frac{1}{3} e^{- a |x|} - 1 \right); \] $0 \leq a, b \leq \infty$; $V$ denotes a singular potential that vanishes at infinity and the unknowns are $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$, $u \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$. This problem is obtained by looking for standing waves of the Schr\"odinger equation coupled with the nonrelativistic gravitational potential prescribed by a family of fourth-order gravity theories. In this paper, (i) we obtain a complete picture of the existence/nonexistence of ground states of the associated autonomous problem for every possible geometry of $K_{a, b}$, (ii) we obtain conditions that ensure the existence of ground states of the nonautonomous problem when $K_{a, b} \leq 0$ and (iii) we prove that as \[ (a, b) \to (A, B) \in \left\{(0, 0), (\infty, \infty), (0, \infty)\right\}, \] ground states of this problem respectively converge to a ground state of (1) the Schr\"odinger equation, (2) the Choquard equation and (3) a rescaling of the Choquard equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of a nonlinear shallow shell model when the shell becomes a plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a nonlinear shallow shell model proposed by Donnell, Vlasov, Mushtari, Galimov, and Koiter. More specifically, we address the question concerning the asymptotic behavior of minimizing solutions. Our result can be applied to general applied forces. Thus, it substantially extends the one given in \cite{oana2} whereby the tangential components of the applied forces are assumed to vanish.</description>

      <title>Global Martingale Entropy Solutions to the Stochastic Isentropic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and compactness of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy for the stochastically forced system of isentropic Euler equations governed by a general pressure law. To achieve these, a stochastic compensated compactness framework in $L^p$ is developed to overcome the difficulty that the uniform $L^{\infty}$ bound for the stochastic approximate solutions is unavailable, owing to the stochastic forcing term. The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Blowup rate for rotational NLS with a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an analytical proof of the ``$\log$-$\log$'' blowup rate for mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a rotation ($\Omega \neq 0$) and a repulsive harmonic potential $V_{\gamma}(x) = \textrm{sgn}(\gamma) \gamma^2 |x|^2$, $\gamma &lt; 0$ when the initial data has a mass slightly above that of $Q$, the ground state solution to the free NLS. The proof is based on a virial identity and an $\mathcal{R}_{\gamma}$-transform, a pseudo-conformal transform in this setting. Further, we obtain a limiting behavior description concerning the mass concentration near blowup time. A remarkable finding is that increasing the value $|\gamma|$ for the repulsive potential $V_{\gamma}$ can give rise to global in time solution for the focusing RNLS, which is in contrast to the case where $\gamma$ is positive. This kind of phenomenon was earlier observed in the non-rotational case $\Omega = 0$ in Carles' work. In addition, we provide numerical simulations to partially illustrate the blowup profile along with the blowup rate using dynamic rescaling and adaptive mesh refinement method.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Motion of discrete interfaces in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths Model: partial wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the variational study of the discrete-to-continuum evolution of lattice systems of Blume-Emery-Griffith type which model two immiscible phases in the presence of a surfactant. In our previous work \cite{CFS}, we analyzed the case of a completely wetted crystal and described how the interplay between surfactant evaporation and mass conservation leads to a transition between crystalline mean curvature flow and pinned evolutions. In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems.</description>

      <title>Refined Limiting Profiles of the Principal Eigenvalue Problems with Large Advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the following eigenvalue problem with an advection term: \begin{equation}\label{0.1} \left\{ \begin{split} -\epsilon\Delta \phi-2\alpha\nabla m(x)\cdot\nabla \phi+V(x)\phi&amp;=\lambda \phi\ \ \text{in}\ \ \Omega,\\ \phi&amp;=0\ \ \hbox{on}\ \ \partial\Omega, ~~~\text{(0.1)} \end{split} \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N~(N\geq1)$ satisfying $\partial\Omega\in C^{2}$ is a bounded domain and contains the origin as an interior point, the constants $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are the diffusive and advection coefficients, respectively, and $m(x)\in C^{2}(\bar{\Omega})$, $V (x)\in C^{\gamma}(\bar{\Omega})~(0&lt;\gamma&lt;1)$ are given functions. We analyze the refined limiting profiles of the principal eigenpair $(\lambda, \phi)$ for (0.1) as $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$, which display the visible effect of the large advection on $(\lambda, \phi)$. It expects that our argument is applicable to investigating the refined expansions of the general principal eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion wave phenomena and optimal time decay for incompressible viscoelastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of D. Hoff and K. Zumbrun (Indiana Univ. Math. J. 44: 603-676, 1995), we investigate the diffusion wave phenomena in three-dimensional incompressible viscoelastic flows. By employing the representation formula of the wave equation and the stationary phase methods on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, we establish $L^p$ decay estimates for the solution over the whole range $1\leq p \leq \infty$, which reveals the hyperbolic nature of the incompressible viscoelastic flows.</description>

      <title>Determining habitat anomalies in cross-diffusion predator-prey chemotaxis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses an open inverse problem at the interface of mathematical analysis and spatial ecology: the unique identification of unknown spatial anomalies -- interpreted as zones of habitat degradation -- and their associated ecological parameters in multi-species predator-prey systems with multiple chemical signals, using only boundary measurements. We formulate the problem as the simultaneous recovery of an unknown interior subdomain and discontinuous ecological interaction rules across its boundary. A unified theooretical framework is developed that unique determines both the anomaly's geometry and discontinuous coefficients characterizing the altered interactions within the degraded region. Our results cover smooth anomalies in time-dependent systems and are extended to non-smooth polyhedral inclusions in stationary regimes. This work bridges a gap between ecological sensing and the quantitative inference of internal habitat heterogeneity, offering a mathamtical basis for detecting and characterizing habitat degradation from limited external data.</description>

      <title>Standing waves of the Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study standing waves for the Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation in dimension 1 and 2. The Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a confining potential and a multiplicative spatial white noise. Standing waves are characterized by a profile which is invariant by the dynamic and solves a nonlinear elliptic equation with spatial white noise potential. We construct such solutions via variational methods and obtain some results on their regularity, localization and stability.</description>

      <title>Derivation of nonlinear time-dependent macroscopic conductivity for an electropermeabilization model via homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a phenomenological electropermeabilization model in a periodic medium representing biological tissue. Starting from a cell-level model describing the electric potential and the degree of porosity, we perform dimension analysis to identify a relevant scaling in terms of a small parameter $\ve$ - the ratio between the cell and the tissue size. The electric potential satisfies electrostatic equations in the extra- and intracellular domains, while its jump across the cell membrane evolves according to a nonlinear law coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the porosity degree. We prove the well-posedness of the microscopic problem, derive a priori estimates, obtain formal asymptotics, and rigorously justify the expansion combining two-scale convergence with monotonicity arguments. The resulting macroscopic model exhibits memory effects and a nonlinear, time-dependent effective current. It captures the nontrivial evolution of effective conductivity, including a characteristic drop reflecting the capacitive behavior of the lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental data. Numerical computations of the effective conductivity confirm that, although microscopic conductivity is constant, tissue conductivity varies nonlinearly with electric field strength, showing a sigmoid trend. This suggests a rigorous mathematical explanation for experimentally observed conductivity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Guillarmou's Normal Operator for Magnetic and Thermostat Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guillarmou's normal operator over a closed Anosov manifold is analogous to the classical normal operator of the geodesic X-ray transform over manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we generalize this normal operator, under some dynamical assumptions, to thermostat flows as well as to the case of the magnetic flows. In particular, we show that these generalized normal operators are elliptic pseudodifferential operators of order -1 in each case. As an application, we prove a stability estimate for the magnetic X-ray transform.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis on the critical points of the Kirchhoff-Routh function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the number of critical points of the Kirchhoff-Routh function \begin{equation*} \mathcal{KR}_D(x,y)=\Lambda_1^2\mathcal{R}_D(x)+\Lambda_2^2\mathcal{R}_D(y)-2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2G_D(x,y), \end{equation*} where $D$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $x,y\in D$, $\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2&gt;0$, $\mathcal{R}_D$ is the Robin function, and $G_D$ is the Green function of the operator $-\Delta$ with $0$ Dirichlet boundary condition on $D$. This function arises from concentration phenomena in nonlinear elliptic problems and from the de-singularization problem for the steady Euler equation. For domains with a small hole, we establish not only the exact number and the location of the critical points of $\mathcal{KR}_D$, but also their nondegeneracy. We show that the location of the hole plays a crucial role. Finally in the context of elliptic problems, we establish the existence of multiple two-peak solutions.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions for non-isothermal compressible nematic liquid crystal flows under a scaling-invariant smallness condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Cauchy problem for a non-isothermal compressible nematic liquid crystal system with far-field vacuum. By deriving refined energy estimates and exploiting the coupled structure of the equations, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, provided that the following scaling-invariant quantity is sufficiently small:
  $$
  \big(1+\bar{\rho}+\tfrac{1}{\bar{\rho}}\big)
  \big[\|\rho_{0}\|_{L^{3}}+(\bar{\rho}^{2}+\bar{\rho})\big(\|\sqrt{\rho_{0}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\|\nabla d_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}\big)\big]
  \big[\|\nabla u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+(\bar{\rho}+1)\|\sqrt{\rho_{0}}\theta_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}
  +\|\nabla^{2} d_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\|\nabla d_{0}\|_{L^{4}}^{4}\big].
  $$
  In particular, our result identifies a new scaling-invariant quantity and does not impose additional restrictions on the viscosity coefficients, which improves previous work (Commun. Math. Sci. 21 (2023), 1455--1486).</description>

      <title>Infinitely many positive solutions to nonlinear scalar field equation with nonsmooth nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of infinitely many positive solutions for the logarithmic scalar field equation
  \begin{equation}
  \tag{$P$} \label{equ1}
  -\Delta u+ V(x) u= u\log u^2, \quad u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{equation}
  and its counterpart with prescribed $L^2$-norms
  \begin{align}\label{equ2} \tag{$P_N$}
  &amp; -\Delta u+ V(x) u +\lambda u= u\log u^2, \quad u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N),
  &amp;\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 ~\mathrm{d}x=a^2&gt;0,
  \end{align}
  which come from physically relevant situations. Here, $N\geq 2$, $V:\mathbb{R}^N\to \mathbb{R}$ is a non-symmetric and non-periodic potential satisfying certain decay conditions, $ a $ is prescribed constant, and $\lambda$ arises as an unknown Lagrange multipliers. For problem \eqref{equ1}, using purely variational methods, we establish the existence of multi-bump positive solutions with either finitely or infinitely many bumps. For normalized problem \eqref{equ2}, we prove the existence of normalized multi-bump positive solutions with a finite number of bumps.
  The main difficulty comes from the nonsmooth nature of logarithmic nonlinearity, which introduces some challenges to the variational framework.
  In particular, the corresponding energy functional is not of class $C^1$ on $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which prevents the direct application of standard critical point theory for $C^1$ functional or any reduction methods for $C^{1+\sigma}$ nonlinearity. The main ingredients in this paper are nonsmooth critical point theory, localized variational methods and a max-min argument.
  To the best of our knowledge, this paper appears to be the first successful application of the localized variational method to nonsmooth functionals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stability and large time behavior for an multi-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamical system with a velocity damping term, for small perturbations near a steady-state of magnetic field fulfilling the Diophantine condition. Our results mathematically characterize the background magnetic field exerts the stabilizing effect, and bridge the gap left by previous work with respect to the asymptotic behavior in time. Our proof approach mainly relies on the Fourier analysis and energy estimates. In addition, we provide a versatile analytical framework applicable to many other partially dissipative fluid models.</description>

      <title>On blow-up rate for the H\'{e}non parabolic equation with Sobolev supercritical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the H\'{e}non parabolic equation $\partial_t u = \Delta u + |x|^\sigma u^p$ in a finite ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$ under the Dirichlet boundary condition, where $N\ge1$, $p&gt;1$, and $\sigma&gt;0$. We assume that the exponent $p$ is supercritical in the Sobolev sense. Since the spatial potential term $|x|^\sigma$ vanishes at the origin, solutions seem less likely to blow up at the origin. We construct a solution that blows up at the origin and also carry out an analysis of blow-up rate of solutions. In particular, if $p$ is less than the Joseph--Lundgren exponent, all blow-ups are shown to be of Type I. The lower bound corresponding to Type I rate is also shown for some particular blow-up solutions. As by products, we present a basic result on classification to threshold solutions for every $p&gt;1+\sigma/N$.</description>

      <title>Ground States for the Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Equation on Open Books and Dimensional Reduction to Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dimensional reduction of stationary states in the shrinking limit for a broad class of two-dimensional domains, called open books, to their counterparts on metric graphs. An open book is a two-dimensional structure formed by rectangular domains sharing common boundaries. We first develop a functional-analytic framework suited to variational problems on open books and establish the existence of solutions as constrained action minimizers. For graph-based open books (i.e., those isomorphic to the product of a graph with an interval) we prove the existence of a sharp transition in the dimensionality of ground states. Specifically, there exists a critical transverse width: below this threshold, all ground states coincide with the ground states on the underlying graph trivially extended in the transverse direction; above it, ground states become genuinely two-dimensional.</description>

Then, in this setting, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions to nonlinear magnetic Schr\"odinger equations on compact metric graphs and on noncompact metric graphs with localized nonlinearities or nonlinearities acting on whole metric graphs, covering the mass-subcritical, mass-critical, and mass-supercritical cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the singular Yamabe problem with negative constant scalar curvature near singular boundaries and derive optimal estimates, where the background metrics are not assumed to be conformally flat. Specifically, we demonstrate that for a wide class of Lipschitz domains with asymptotic conical structure, the local positive solutions are well approximated by the positive solutions in the tangent cones at singular boundary points. This extends the results of [10, 12, 26].</description>

We prove local boundedness and H\"older regularity of its weak solutions under natural assumptions on the coefficients $a(\cdot,\cdot)$, $b(\cdot,\cdot)$ and the powers $s,t$, and $p$. Moreover, when $a(\cdot,\cdot) \equiv 1$, we also prove a Harnack inequality for weak solutions.</description>

Abstract: A well-posedness and maximal regularity result for the time-periodic Cahn-Hilliard-Gurtin system in the half space is proved. For this purpose, we introduce a novel class of complementing boundary conditions, extending the classical Lopatinski\u{\i}-Shapiro conditions from elliptic and parabolic theory to time-periodic mixed-order systems with general boundary conditions. Moreover, we show that the classical Lopatinski\u{\i}-Shapiro conditions are in general insufficient for well-posedness of mixed-order systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse scattering problem of a topologically non-trivial waveguide separating two-dimensional topological insulators. We consider the specific model of a Dirac system. We show that a short-range perturbation can be fully reconstructed from scattering data in a linearized setting and in a finite-dimensional setting under a smallness constraint. We also provide a stability result in appropriate topologies. We then solve the problem numerically by means of a standard adjoint method and illustrate our theoretical findings with several numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the bilinear approximate controllability for the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation with a power-type nonlinearity of any integer degree on a torus of arbitrary space dimension. Under a saturation hypothesis on the control operator, we show the small-time global controllability of the CGL equation. The proof is obtained by developing a multiplicative version of a geometric control approach, introduced by Agrachev and Sarychev in \cite{AS05,AS06}.</description>

      <title>Solving the constraint equation for general free data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the Einstein constraint equations in vacuum by a new method, which allows us to prescribe four scalar quantities, representing the full dynamical degrees of freedom of the constraint system. We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\ell\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-\delta})$, $k=O(r^{-2-\delta})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong.</description>

      <title>Convergent numerical schemes for the viscoelastic Giesekus model in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a class of stable and convergent numerical methods for the approximate solution of the viscoelastic Giesekus model in two space dimensions. The model couples the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with an evolution equation for an additional stress tensor accounting for elastic effects. This coupled evolution equation is stated here in terms of the elastic deformation gradient and models transport and nonlinear relaxation effects. In the existing literature, numerical schemes for such models often suffer from accuracy limitations and convergence problems, usually due to the lack of rigorous existence results or inherent limitations of the discretization. Therefore, our main goal is to prove the (subsequence) convergence of the proposed numerical method to a large-data global weak solution in two dimensions, without relying on cut-offs or additional regularization. This also provides an alternative proof of the recent existence result by Bul\'{\i}\v{c}ek et al.~(Nonlinearity, 2022). Finally, we verify the practicality of the proposed method through numerical experiments, including convergence studies and typical benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Scaling inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues in space forms and sharp eigenvalue estimates on warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part, we derive monotonicity of the normalized spectra for the second-order Steklov problem and two fourth-order Steklov problems on the $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with respect to the geodesic radius in the sphere and the hyperbolic space. The normalizations are made using four natural geometric factors. As corollaries, we get Escobar-type bounds for Steklov eigenvalues on $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with varying curvature in space forms. We also get two monotonicity results for higher-dimensional cases. In the second part, we obtain some sharp bounds concerning the spectra of the two fourth-order Steklov problems on warped product manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and a strictly convex boundary. In particular, we confirm Qiaoling Wang and Changyu Xia's conjecture (2018) on the sharp lower bound of the first non-zero eigenvalue of a fourth-order Steklov problem in the case of $3$-dimensional warped product manifolds.</description>

      <title>Small-time global controllability of a class of bilinear fourth-order parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the small-time global controllability properties of a class of fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equations driven by a bilinear control posed on the one-dimensional torus. The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rotationally symmetric translators for fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows driven by a curvature function, and we establish the fine asymptotics of bowl-type evolutions and, when admissible, the construction and classification of catenoidal-type solutions, together with their asymptotic behavior. Under natural structural and convexity assumptions, we also prove rigidity and uniqueness results within appropriate classes of graphical translators of such curvature flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14835v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results of this paper are twofold. One is that we show the local existence and uniqueness of very regular or smooth solution to the initial-Neumann boundary value problem of the Schr\"{o}dinger flow for maps from a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^m$ with $m=1,2,3$ into $\mathbb{S}^2$ in the scale of Sobolev spaces. In this part, we provide a precise description of the compatibility conditions at the boundary for the initial data. The other is that we further prove that the locally smooth solution to the initial-Neumann boundary value problem of the 1-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger flow can be extended to a global smooth one.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a fully nonlinear evolution inclusion of second order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.05235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-posedness of the abstract \textsc{Cauchy} problem for the doubly nonlinear evolution inclusion equation of second order \begin{align*} \begin{cases} u''(t)+\partial \Psi(u'(t))+B(t,u(t))\ni f(t), &amp;\quad t\in (0,T),\, T&gt;0,\\ u(0)=u_0, \quad u'(0)=v_0 \end{cases} \end{align*} in a real separable \textsc{Hilbert} space $\mathscr{H}$, where $u_0\in \mathscr{H}, v_0\in \overline{D(\partial \Psi)}\cap D(\Psi), f\in L^2(0,T;\mathscr{H})$. The functional $\Psi: \mathscr{H} \rightarrow (-\infty,+\infty]$ is supposed to be proper, lower semicontinuous, and convex and the nonlinear operator $B:[0,T]\times \mathscr{H}\rightarrow \mathscr{H}$ is supposed to satisfy a (local) \textsc{Lipschitz} condition. Existence and uniqueness of strong solutions $u\in H^2(0,T^*;\mathscr{H})$ as well as the continuous dependence of solutions from the data re shown by employing the theory of nonlinear semigroups and the Banach fixed-point theorem. If $B$ satisfies a local Lipschitz condition, then the existence of strong local solutions are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(r)$ with $r\equiv |x|$. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. In addition, we also derive a set of spatial decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the time-asymptotic stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ using the energy method. More specifically, we prove this under small initial perturbation on $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, provided that the density at the far-field is supposed to be strictly positive but suitably small, in other words, the far-field state of the fluid is not vacuum but suitably rarefied. The main difficulty for the proof is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Well-posedeness for the non-isotropic Schr\"odinger equations on cylinders and periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial value problem (IVP) for the non-isotropic Schr\"odinger equation posed on the two-dimensional cylinders and $\mathbb{T}^2$ is considered. The IVP is shown to be locally well-posed for small initial data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})$ if $s\geq0$. For the IVP posed on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$, given data are considered in the anisotropic Sobolev spaces thereby obtaining the local well-posedness result in $H^{s_1, s_2}(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T})$, if $s_1\geq0$ and $s_2&gt;\frac12$. In the purely periodic case, a particular case of the IVP is shown to be locally well-posed for any given initial data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ if $s&gt;\frac14$. In some cases, ill-posedness issues are also considered showing that the IVP posed on $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}$, in the focusing case, is ill-posed in the sense that the application data-solution fails to be uniformly continuous for data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})$ if $-\frac12\leq s&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Quasilinearization with regularizing tensor paraproducts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Bony's celebrated work on paraproducts to continous and multiscale \emph{tensor} paraproducts. For $A \in \mathcal{C}^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $f \in \Lambda_{\alpha}([0,1]^2, d_d(x,y)^{\alpha} \times d'_d(x',y')^{\alpha})$, we construct an approximation, $\tilde{A}_{(N,N')}(f)$ to $A(f)$, replacing the operator $T: f \to A(f)$ with the continous tensor paraproduct, $\Pi^{(t,t')}_{(A',A'')}$, and the multiscale tensor paraproduct $\Pi^{(N,N')}_{(A',A'')}:f \to \tilde{A}_{(N,N')}(f) + \Delta_{ (N,N')}(A,f)$. In the multiscale case, we provide estimates on the residual, $\Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f)$, and show it has twice the regularity of $f$ such that $\Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f) \in \Lambda_{2 \alpha}([0,1]^2)$ and $\lVert \Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f) \rVert_{\Lambda_{2\alpha}([0,1]^2)} \leq C_A \lVert f \rVert_{\Lambda_{\alpha}([0,1]^2)} $. Our theoretical findings are supplemented with a computational example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a numerical investigation of topological interactions in flocking dynamics. Starting from a microscopic description of the phenomena, mesoscopic and macroscopic models have been previously derived under specific assumptions. We explore the role of topological interactions by describing the convergence speed to consensus in both microscopic and macroscopic dynamics, considering different forms of topological interactions. Additionally, we compare mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics for monokinetic and non-monokinetic initial data. Finally, we illustrate with some simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains the sensitive dependence of solutions on initial conditions, including the case where the system exhibits two solutions starting with the same initial data.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control and Calder\'on type Inverse Problems in Non-local heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine various density results related to the solutions of the non-local heat equation at a specific time slice, focusing on two distinct models: one with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and the other with singular boundary data. In both the cases, we assume the non-local exponent $a\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$. We explore both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the approximations. Additionally, we address Calder\'on-type inverse problems for these parabolic models, where we recover the potentials by analyzing the solutions either on the boundary or at a particular time slice. In both the density results and the Calder\'on type inverse problems, the Pohozaev identity plays a crucial role. Finally, in the last section, we apply the Pohozaev identity to a specific elliptic eigenvalue problem and demonstrate that the eigenfunctions, when divided by an appropriate power of the distance function, can not vanish on any non-empty open subset of the boundary. This particular eigenvalue problem does not need any restriction on the non-local exponent.</description>

      <title>Boundary Value Problems in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane with $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results for the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity problems for the Laplace equation in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane, considering $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary. More specifically, we study the $L^{p,1}$-solvability for the Dirichlet problem, complementing results of Kenig (1980) and Carro and Ortiz-Caraballo (2018). Then, we study $L^p$-solvability of the Neumann problem, obtaining a range of solvability which is empty in some cases, a clear difference with the arc-length case. When it is not empty, it is an interval, and we consider solvability at its endpoints, establishing conditions for Lorentz space solvability when $p&gt;1$ and atomic Hardy space solvability when $p=1$. Solving the Lorentz endpoint leads us to a two-weight Sawyer-type inequality, for which we give a sufficient condition. Finally, we show how to adapt to the Regularity problem the results for the Neumann problem.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the unique identifiability and stable recovery of a spatially dependent variable-order in the subdiffusion model from the boundary flux measurement. We establish several new unique identifiability results from the observation at one point on the boundary without / with the knowledge of medium properties, and a conditional Lipschitz stability estimate when the observation is available on the whole boundary. The analysis crucially employs resolvent estimates in the $L^r(\Omega)$ ($r&gt;d$) spaces, solution representation in the Laplace domain and novel asymptotic expansions of the Laplace transform of the boundary flux at $p= 0$ and $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the global well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations with temperature-dependent coefficients is a challenging problem, especially in multi-dimensional space. In this paper, we study the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with temperature-dependent coefficients in the whole space. When the initial density and the initial temperature are linearly equivalent to some large constant states, we establish the first result on the global existence of large strong solution. Moreover, the optimal decay rates of the solution to its associated equilibrium are established when the initial data belong to $L^{p_0}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for some $p_0\in[1,2]$.</description>

In \cite{MNP}, part of this theory (an atomic decomposition) is developed for a specific tent space where functions are defined just in a proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+,$ and without the use of an area function. In the present paper, using a variation of the area function considered in \cite{FSU}, we define the Gaussian area function and Gaussian tent spaces and prove both their atomic decompositions and the characterization of their dual spaces. Some applications are also considered.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous steady states for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider homogeneous (stationary self-similar) solutions to the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equations parametrized by the constant $0&lt;s&lt;1$, representing the 2D Euler equations ($s=1$), the SQG equations $(s=1/2)$, and stationary equations ($s=0$); namely, solutions whose stream function $\psi$ and advected scalar $\omega$ are of the form \begin{align*} \psi=\frac{w(\theta)}{r^{\beta}},\quad \omega=\frac{g(\theta)}{r^{\beta+2s}}, \end{align*} in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ with parameter $\beta\in \mathbb{R}$. We classify homogeneous steady states across the full parameter space, and we identify the limiting singular regimes assuming an odd symmetric profile $(w,g)$ with Fourier modes larger than $m_0\geq 1$. Specifically, we show existence of such solutions for $-m_0-2s&lt;\beta&lt;-2s$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;m_0+2$ ($1/2-s&lt;\beta&lt; m_0+2$ for $0&lt;s&lt;1/2$) and non-existence of such solutions for $-2s\leq \beta\leq 0$. The main result provides examples of self-similar solutions which belong to critical and supercritical regimes for the local well-posedness of the gSQG equations for $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and the first examples of self-similar solutions for the SQG equations and the more singular equations $0&lt;s\leq 1/2$ in the stationary setting. We also complement our findings with a numerical illustration of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Weakly localized states of one dimensional Schrodinger equations have localized energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the Schr\"odinger equation with time-dependent potential in dimension one. Assuming that the potential decays sufficiently rapidly as $|x| \to \infty$, we prove that the solution can be written as the sum of a free wave $e^{-it\Delta} u_+$ and a weakly bound component $u_{\text{wb}}(t)$. Moreover, we show that the weakly bound part decomposes as $u_{\text{wb}}(t) = u_{\text{loc}}(t) + o_{\dot{H}^1}(1)$, where $\partial_x u_\text{loc}(t)$ is localized near the origin uniformly in time. Since decay conditions on the potential do not preclude resonances unless $d \geq 5$, our results can be seen as a natural extension of [Terence Tao. Dynamics of Partial Differential Equations, 5(2), 2008] and [Avy Soffer, Xiaoxu Wu. arXiv:2304.04245] to the lower-dimensional case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_1}A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1 \cdot \nabla u_1 = \lambda_1 u_1 + g_{\beta,1}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[3mm] -\mathrm{div}(A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_2}A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2 \cdot \nabla u_2 = \lambda_2 u_2 + g_{\beta,2}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[2mm] u_1 = u_2 = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 &lt; \mu_1$, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian, and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain. The nonlinearity derives from a potential $G_\beta$ with subcritical growth.
  Due to the lack of differentiability of the associated energy functional, we employ nonsmooth critical point theory and variational methods based on the concept of weak slope. We prove the existence of least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta &gt; 0$) and competitive ($\beta &lt; 0$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of generalized abcd Boussinesq solitary waves under a slowly variable bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb R_t\times\mathbb R_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first-order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two-dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among the various particular regimes, each determined by the values of the parameters $(a, b, c, d)$ appearing in the equations, the \emph{generic} regime is characterized by the conditions $b, d &gt; 0$ and $a, c &lt; 0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is Hamiltonian.
  In this paper, we investigate the existence of generalized solitary waves and the corresponding collision problem in the physically relevant \emph{variable bottom regime}, introduced by M.\ Chen. More precisely, the bottom is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=\varepsilon h_0(\varepsilon t,\varepsilon x)$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter and $h_0$ is a fixed smooth profile. This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction. We establish this result by constructing a new approximate solution that captures the interaction between the solitary wave and the slowly varying bottom.</description>

      <title>Supersonic sonic patch solution for the two-dimensional Euler equations with a van der Waals equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate supersonic transonic phenomena in the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations governed by a polytropic van der Waals equation of state. In contrast to the ideal gas setting, the non-ideal pressure law introduces stronger nonlinear effects and modifies the degeneracy structure near sonic states, which significantly complicates the analytical treatment of transonic flows. Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system. We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve. In addition, we investigate the regularity properties of the resulting sonic boundary. Our results extend the theory of supersonic sonic patches from polytropic gases to a realistic non-ideal gas model.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metrics on K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo-Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic regularizations of optimal transport problems under suitable summability assumptions on the point-wise transport cost. These summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with more than two marginals.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a semi-global existence and convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \sim M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from a class of arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like `time'. A main novelty is to uncover a new weak null-type structure (different from the well known null structure in the literature) in the field equations induced by the positive cosmological constant in constant mean curvature gauge that is absent in pure vacuum. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic in-distinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime of Einstein-$\Lambda$ dynamics. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of dissociatedness and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is the establishment of the propagation of dissociatedness, a conceptual generalization of the classical propagation of chaos that accommodates the intrinsic local correlations between particles and their weights. The limiting McKean-Vlasov process is characterized by an Aldous-Hoover representation on a filtered probability space, beyond the standard one-particle law (or a family thereof). Paralleling the classical equivalence between propagation of chaos and the convergence of empirical measures to the one-particle law, we show that the propagation of dissociatedness corresponds to the convergence of the empirical structure under a distance unifying the Wasserstein distance for particles and the cut distance for weights. This quantitative stability is grounded in an adaptation of the sampling lemma from dense graph theory, analogous to the classical concentration results for empirical measures in the Wasserstein distance.</description>

Abstract: We study a general class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume under weak nonlinearity scaling and with non-equilibrium initial data. We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of these equations. This makes rigorous the original derivation of the KPZ equation from physics in the full-space setting, which was a problem posed by Hairer-Quastel '18. Our analysis is based on a stochastic heat kernel for a linearization of said SPDEs.</description>

Abstract: In this third work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with twisted DIrichlet boundary conditions on a finite timelike boundary. The boundary conditions consist of specification of the pointwise conformal class of the boundary metric, together with a scalar density involving a combination of the volume form of the bulk metric restricted to the boundary together with the volume form of the boundary metric itself.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>
