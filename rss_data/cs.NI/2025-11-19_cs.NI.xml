      <title>Benchmarking OpenWiFiSync on ESP32: Towards Cost-Effective Wireless Time Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless time synchronization of mobile devices is a key enabler for numerous Industry 4.0 applications, such as coordinated and synchronized tasks or the generation of high-precision timestamps for machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms. Traditional wireline clock synchronization protocols, however, cannot achieve the performance in wireless environments without significant modifications. To address this challenge, we make use of the Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization protocol, which leverages the broadcast nature of wireless communications and remains both non-invasive and standard-compliant. We implement and validate this protocol on a low-cost testbed using ESP32 modules and a commercial Wi-Fi access point. To support further research and development, we release our implementation as open-source software under the GNU General Public License Version 3 license via the OpenWifiSync project on GitHub.
  Our results demonstrate that synchronization accuracies within +/-30 microseconds are achievable using energy-efficient and affordable hardware, making this approach suitable for a wide range of use cases.</description>

      <title>Cracking the Microsecond: An Efficient and Precise Time Synchronization Scheme for Hybrid 5G-TSN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise time synchronization in wireless systems is essential for both industrial applications and 5G, where sub-microsecond accuracy is required. However, since the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is negligible compared to the consumer electronics market, the so-called IIoT enhancements have not yet been implemented in silicon. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this situation will change soon. Thus, alternative solutions must be explored. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scheme that uses a protocol capable of leveraging existing infrastructure to synchronize User Equipments (UEs), with one of the UEs serving as the master. If this master is connected via a wired link to the factory network, it can also function as a boundary clock for the factory network, including any Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network. Furthermore, the 5G Core Network (5GC) and 5G Base Station (gNB) can also be synchronized if they are connected either to the factory network or to the master UE. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on a hardware testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Time offset and clock skew are analyzed using a moving average filter with various window sizes. Results show that a filter size of 1024 provides the best accuracy for offset prediction between UEs. In a controlled lab environment, the approach consistently achieves synchronization within +/-50 ns, leaving sufficient margin for synchronization errors in real deployments while still maintaining sub-microsecond accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the proposed protocol for stringent industrial use cases.</description>

      <title>From Topology to Behavioral Semantics: Enhancing BGP Security by Understanding BGP's Language with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trust-based nature of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) makes it vulnerable to disruptions like prefix hijacking and misconfigurations, threatening routing stability. Traditional detection relies on manual inspection with limited scalability. Machine/Deep Learning (M/DL) approaches automate detection but suffer from suboptimal precision, limited generalizability, and high retraining costs. This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes.
  To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role. We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version. Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies. Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%. Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability. Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours).</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Packet Scheduling and Congestion Control Algorithms on MPTCP Performance over Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern mobile and stationary devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces aiming to provide wireless and wireline connectivity either in a local LAN or the Internet. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol has been developed on top of legacy TCP to allow the simultaneous use of multiple network paths in the communication route between two end-systems. Although the combination of multiple paths is beneficial in case of links with similar network characteristics, MPTCP performance is challenged as heterogeneity among the used paths increases. This work provides an overview of the MPTCP protocol operation, analyzes the state-of-art packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms available in literature, and examines the impact of the various algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance, by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation under diverse path-heterogeneity conditions.</description>

      <title>Semantic Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Over-the-Air Computation for Semi-Federated Learning Towards Scalable AI in Computing-Heterogeneous IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems demands scalable artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that can operate in computing-heterogeneous environments with diverse hardware capabilities and non-independent and identically distributed data. This paper proposes a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework that integrates centralized learning (CL) and federated learning (FL) to enable efficient model training across heterogeneous IoT devices. In SemiFL, only devices with sufficient computational resources are designated for local model training (referred to as FL users), while the remaining devices transmit raw data to a base station (BS) for remote computation (referred to as CL users). This collaborative computing framework enables all IoT devices to participate in global model training, regardless of their computational capabilities and data distributions. Furthermore, to alleviate radio resource scarcity of SemiFL, we propose a joint communication and over-the-air computation design that unifies wireless transmission and model aggregation. This approach reduces latency and enhances spectrum efficiency by allowing simultaneous communication and computation over the air. Furthermore, we design a transceiver architecture that integrates receive beamforming and successive interference cancellation to mitigate multi-user interference, ensuring reliable aggregation at the BS. Subsequently, two scenarios are examined to assess the efficacy of SemiFL within IoT systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed next-generation multiple access (NGMA)-based SemiFL outperforms the fixed beamforming-based FL by 8% and the AirComp-based FL by 6.4%, demonstrating its superior learning efficiency and convergence performance.</description>

      <title>Mobile Jamming Mitigation in 5G Networks: A MUSIC-Based Adaptive Beamforming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Task Offloading of Vehicular Edge Computing with Parallel Computation Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers a parallel task execution strategy in vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, where edge servers are deployed along the roadside to process offloaded computational tasks of vehicular users. To minimize the overall waiting delay among vehicular users, a novel task offloading solution is implemented based on the network cooperation balancing resource under-utilization and load congestion. Dual evaluation through theoretical and numerical ways shows that the developed solution achieves a globally optimal delay reduction performance compared to existing methods, which is also validated by the feasibility test over a real-map virtual environment. The in-depth analysis reveals that predicting the instantaneous processing power of edge servers facilitates the identification of overloaded servers, which is critical for determining network delay. By considering discrete variables of the queue, the proposed technique's precise estimation can effectively address these combinatorial challenges to achieve optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Handover Configurations in Operational 5G Networks: Diversity, Evolution, and Impact on Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobility management in cellular networks, especially the handover (HO) process, plays a key role in providing seamless and ubiquitous Internet access. The wide-scale deployment of 5G and the resulting co-existence of 4G/5G in the past six years have significantly changed the landscape of all mobile network operators and made the HO process much more complex than before. While several recent works have studied the impact of HOs on user experience, why and how HOs occur and how HO configurations affect performance in 5G operational networks remains largely unknown. Through four cross-country driving trips across the US spread out over a 27-month period, we conduct an in-depth measurement study of HO configurations across all three major US operators. Our study reveals (a) new types of HOs and new HO events used by operators to handle these new types of HOs, (b) overly aggressive HO configurations that result in unnecessarily high signaling overhead, (c) large diversity in HO configuration parameter values, which also differ across operators, but significantly lower diversity in 5G compared to LTE, and (d) sub-optimal HO configurations/decisions leading to poor pre- or post-HO performance. Our findings have many implications for mobile operators, as they keep fine-tuning their 5G HO configurations.</description>

      <title>Tele-LLM-Hub: Building Context-Aware Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Telecom Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Tele-LLM-Hub, a user friendly low-code solution for rapid prototyping and deployment of context aware multi-agent (MA) Large Language Model (LLM) systems tailored for 5G and beyond. As telecom wireless networks become increasingly complex, intelligent LLM applications must share a domainspecific understanding of network state. We propose TeleMCP, the Telecom Model Context Protocol, to enable structured and context-rich communication between agents in telecom environments. Tele-LLM-Hub actualizes TeleMCP through a low-code interface that supports agent creation, workflow composition, and interaction with software stacks such as srsRAN. Key components include a direct chat interface, a repository of pre-built systems, an Agent Maker leveraging finetuning with our RANSTRUCT framework, and an MA-Maker for composing MA workflows. The goal of Tele-LLM-Hub is to democratize the design of contextaware MA systems and accelerate innovation in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Resilient by Design -- Active Inference for Distributed Continuum Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>
