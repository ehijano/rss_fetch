      <title>Canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime in a cavity surrounded by a heat reservoir through the Euclidean path integral formalism. The heat reservoir is described by the boundary of the cavity with fixed radius $R$, fixed temperature $T$, and fixed electric charge $Q$. We use York's approach to find the reduced action, and then perform a zero loop approximation. We find that the number of solutions for the black hole depends on the electric charge being smaller or larger than a critical $Q_s$, having two stable and one unstable solutions for the former case, and one stable solution for the latter. We obtain the system's thermodynamic properties from the partition function. We analyze thermodynamic stability, controlled by the positivity of the heat capacity at constant area and electric charge. We show that there is a discontinuity in the heat capacity, signaling a turning point. We investigate the favorable stable phases and the phase diagram of the system. We show that the two stable black hole solutions can suffer a first order phase transition from one to the other, and at the critical charge $Q_s$ this turns into a second order one. We introduce a model of charged hot flat space, i.e., hot flat space with charge near the boundary. We find that a first order phase transition between the large stable black hole and charged hot flat space occurs at a horizon radius larger than the Buchdahl bound, and comment on the physics. Finally, we recover the Davies thermodynamic solutions and a Rindler solution in the limit of infinite cavity, and the York solutions in the limit of zero charge. Hence, both York and Davies formalisms are unified and connected in our approach. In all instances we mention carefully the four-dimensional case, for which we accomplish new results, and study in detail all aspects of the five-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Universality of entanglement in gluon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of fundamental degrees of freedom in particle physics is generated ab initio in scattering processes. In the case of a pure $SU(N)$ gauge theory, two gluons in a product state can be entangled in their polarizations as the result of three- and four-gluon vertex interactions. We find that entanglement is only produced when the initial product state have opposite polarizations, and that maximal entanglement is generated when the outgoing particles form an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with respect to the incoming ones. A surprising result is that the amount of entanglement among gluon polarizations is independent of the gauge group at any angle and, thus, of the color degree of freedom. Universality of entanglement for any gauge group emerges. It is also found that a small deviation of the relative weight between three- and four-gluon vertices would prevent the generation of maximal entanglement. This can be seen as a small piece of a possible it from qubit principle underlying fundamental interactions, that is a principle that requires physics to be quantum in origin.</description>

      <title>Scale separation from O-planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orientifold planes play a crucial role in flux compactifications of string theory, and we demonstrate their deep connection to achieving scale-separated solutions. Specifically, we show that when an orientifold plane contributes at leading order to the non-zero value of the scalar potential, then either the weak coupling limit or the large volume limit implies scale separation, meaning that the Kaluza-Klein tower mass decouples from the inverse length scale of the lower-dimensional theory. Notably, in the supergravity limit such solutions are inherently scale-separated. This result is independent of the spacetime dimension and the dimensionality of the O$p$-plane as long as $p&lt;7$. Similarly, we show that parametric scale separation is not possible for isotropic compactifications with a leading curvature term that generically arise in the AdS/CFT context. We classify all possible flux compactification setups in both type IIA and type IIB string theory for O$p$-planes with $2\leq p\leq 6$ and present their universal features. While the parametrically controlled scale-separated solutions are all AdS, we also find setups that allow for dS vacua. We prove that flux quantization prevents these dS vacua from arising in a regime of parametric control.</description>

      <title>The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a bidimensional space added to the Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedom, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop for the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex through the Ward identity. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections and Extremality: A Generalized Universal Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logarithmic corrections to the entropy of extremal black holes have proven effective in precisely matching the microscopic degeneracies obtained from string-theoretic as well as a non-perturbative quantum correction manifests as an exponential term in the black hole entropy. In this work, we extend the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco by deriving a generalized form where entropy is not just the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our analysis treats entropy as a general function of the horizon radius, and with the help of that, we formulate the generalized universal relation. We show that, in the case of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the generalized relation coincides with the original universal relation by Goon and Penco. Furthermore, we explore the implications of logarithmic and exponential corrections to entropy and test the validity of the generalized universal relation under these modifications.</description>

      <title>A systematic approach to $\ell$-loop planar integrands from the classical equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a recursive method for $\ell$-loop planar integrands in colored quantum field theories. We start with the classical equation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to define the loop kernels. Then we construct the $\ell$-loop integrands based on some recursion rules for the $\ell$-loop kernels. Finally, we reach a recursion formula for the $\ell$-loop planar integrands. Our method can be easily generalized to general quantum field theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to obtain the planar part of the whole $\ell$-loop integrands.</description>

      <title>Form factors from string amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a stringy model for $n$-point tree-level form factor with the off-shell operator in the scalar and gluon theories, from the bosonic string disk amplitude: $n$ open string states and $1$ closed string state scatter on the disk. In the field-theory limit ($\alpha'\to0$), the stringy form factor reduces to the form factor, helps us to investigate the hidden properties of the field-theory form factors, manifest the factorization and soft behaviors, and uncover more non-trivial relations between form factors and scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Uplift in Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The n-point functions of any Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in $d$ dimensions can always be interpreted as spatial restrictions of corresponding functions in a higher-dimensional CFT with dimension $d'&gt; d$. In particular, when a four-point function in $d$ dimensions has a known conformal block expansion, this expansion can be easily extended to $d'=d+2$ due to a remarkable identity among conformal blocks, discovered by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani (KRT) as a consequence of Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry and confirmed to hold in any CFT with $d &gt; 1$. In this note, we provide an elementary proof of this identity using simple algebraic properties of the Casimir operators. Additionally, we construct five differential operators, $\Lambda_i$, which promote a conformal block in $d$ dimensions to five conformal blocks in $d+2$ dimensions. These operators can be normalized such that $\sum_i \Lambda_i = 1$, from which the KRT identity immediately follows. Similar, simpler identities have been proposed, all of which can be reformulated in the same way.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

      <title>Wilson lines with endpoints in 3d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an infinite Wilson line in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the appropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in $N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.</description>

      <title>Classical limit of the geometric Langlands correspondence for $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13393v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the integrable structure of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This is done by introducing explicit parameterisations for the different strata of the Hitchin moduli spaces, and by adapting the Separation of Variables method from the theory of integrable models to the Hitchin moduli spaces. The resulting description exhibits a clear analogy with Drinfeld's first construction of the geometric Langlands correspondence. It can be seen as a classical limit of a version of Drinfeld's construction which is adapted to the complex number field.</description>

      <title>From $\lambda$-connections to $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-opers with apparent singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03244v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-perturbative effects on quasi-topological black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of non-perturbative quantum corrections to the entropy of both charged and charged rotating quasi-topological black holes, with a focus on their thermodynamic properties. The negative-valued correction to the entropy for small black holes is found to be unphysical. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of these non-perturbative corrections on other thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, Gibbs free energy, charge density, and mass density, for both types of black holes. Our findings indicate that the sign of the correction parameter plays a crucial role at small horizon radii. Additionally, we assess the stability and phase transitions of these black holes in the presence of non-perturbative corrections. Below the critical point, both the corrected and uncorrected specific heat per unit volume are in an unstable regime. This instability leads to a first-order phase transition, wherein the specific heat transitions from negative to positive values as the system reaches a stable state.</description>

      <title>Dark-Matter Induced Scalarization of Black Holes in Extended Scalar-Tensor-Gauss-Bonnet Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet theory, spontaneous scalarization in the GB\(^-\) regime typically occurs only in rotating black holes, while it is absent in spherically symmetric black holes, a phenomenon known as spin-induced scalarization. However, we find that when the spacetime is permeated by perfect fluid dark matter, spontaneous scalarization can also be induced by dark matter in the GB\(^-\) regime. Analytical calculations reveal that this scalarization occurs when the dark matter parameter \(b/M\) exceeds a critical value \((b/M)_\text{crit}\simeq1.86287\), a threshold determined by the lower boundary of the unstable region for scalar perturbations as the coupling constant approaches negative infinity. Additionally, we verified these findings through numerical analysis of the time evolution of scalar perturbations, identifying the unstable parameter region. The results show that when coupling constant \(-\lambda/M^2\) is small, spontaneous scalarization only occurs near the extremal black hole limit. As \(-\lambda/M^2\) increases, the scalarization region expands; however, its lower boundary remains above \(b/M \simeq 1.86287\), consistent with theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>

      <title>The cosmological constant problem: from Newtonian cosmology to the greatest puzzle of modern theoretical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological constant problem is one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics, since it is deeply rooted in the problematic interplay between quantum fields and gravity. The aim of this work is to review the key conceptual elements needed to formulate the problem and some ideas for a possible solution. I do so by weaving a fil rouge from Newtonian cosmology, through general relativity and the standard model of relativistic cosmology ({\Lambda}-CDM), up to the theory of quantum fields. In the first part, the issues with the application of Newtonian gravity to an infinite and static universe are addressed, observing how a cosmological term in the Poisson equation would stabilize a homogeneous matter distribution. A toy derivation of the Friedman equations using only Newtonian arguments is also shown. In the second part, the conceptual path leading to general relativity and the {\Lambda}-CDM model is laid down, with particular emphasis to the historical introduction of the cosmological constant and its new role after the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Finally, the problem is formulated within the framework of quantum field theory. Its many facets are discussed together with the criticalities in the formulation and some of the leading ideas for its solution are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consequences of Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity on neutrino dynamics. The analysis is structured around three key phenomena: the energy output associated with neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the impact of spacetime geometry on the oscillation phases of neutrinos, and the changes in flavor transition probabilities caused by gravitational lensing effects. To complement the theoretical framework, we also carry out a numerical evaluation of neutrino oscillation probabilities, comparing scenarios of normal and inverted mass orderings within a two-flavor approximation.</description>

      <title>Minimal Magnetogenesis: The Role of Inflationary Perturbations and ALPs, and Its Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at $\Mpc$ scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct cosmological model in nonmetricity scalar functional gravitational Lagrangian $f(Q)$ which describes the dynamical evolution of the late accelerating universe. Cosmological models are constructed considering different functional of $f(Q)$ gravity where $Q$ in the gravitational action. We obtain cosmological model probing late universe with a constant jerk parameter. The observational constraints that are imposed on the model parameters for a realistic scenario estimated using the observational Hubble data and the Pantheon dataset. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, energy density and the equation of state (EoS) parameter are also explored. The transition of the universe from a deceleration to an accelerating phase is investigated in different framework of $f(Q)$ theories. We also analyzed the variation of the effective EoS parameter and found that the matter content in the universe favours quintessence type fluid in all the $f(Q)$-gravity. The energy conditions for a realistic scenario are examined and noted that the effective fluid violates the strong energy condition.</description>

      <title>An equivalence theorem for algebraic and functorial QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel approach to functorial quantum field theories (FQFTs) in the context of Lorentzian geometry. The key challenge is that globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot change the topology of the Cauchy surface. This is addressed and solved by introducing a more flexible concept of bordisms which provide morphisms from tuples of causally disjoint partial Cauchy surfaces to a later-in-time full Cauchy surface. They assemble into a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism pseudo-operad, generalizing the geometric bordism pseudo-categories of Stolz and Teichner. The associated FQFTs are defined as pseudo-multifunctors into a symmetric monoidal category of unital associative algebras. The main result of this paper is an equivalence theorem between such globally hyperbolic Lorentzian FQFTs and algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs), both subject to the time-slice axiom and a mild descent condition called additivity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. As an application, we show that in Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m--anti de Sitter spacetime, no geodesic satisfies the sufficient conditions for time advance even in the super-extremal case. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics Through CP Violation in $B_{(s)}\to V\mu^+\mu^-$ Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare decays of the kind $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s\to \phi\mu^+\mu^-$ are key players for testing the Standard Model. The current experimental data for their decay rates and angular observables show tensions with the theoretical predictions that may be indications of New Physics. We present a strategy to extract the relevant short-distance coefficients in the presence of new sources of CP violation, utilizing a synergy with $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. Using the current data as a guideline, we illustrate the new method to determine the complex coefficients $C_9^{(\prime)}$ and $C_{10}^{(\prime)}$ using only four angular observables. Interestingly, the current experimental picture leaves significant room for CP-violating New Physics. We discuss also the link to leptonic $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. We are looking forward to the implementation of these strategies at the future high-precision frontier of flavour physics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP) effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation. Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are derived in Minkowski spacetime, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections that ensure a minimal observable length and revert to standard dynamics when corrections are absent. For fermionic fields in curved spacetime, spin connections maintain gravitational consistency. This framework, applicable to high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates quantum gravity into relativistic field theories.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristics for Feynman Integral Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new methods for optimizing the integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals, an important computational bottleneck in modern perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Using the simple example of one-loop massive bubble integrals, we pose the problem of minimizing the number of arithmetic operations in reducing a target integral to master integrals via the Laporta algorithm. This is a nontrivial combinatorial optimization problem over the ordering of IBP equation generation (from pairs of seed integrals and IBP operators) and the ordering of integral elimination. Our first proposed method is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an environment in a step-by-step manner and learning the best actions to take given an observation of the environment (in this case, the current state of the IBP reduction process). The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g. simulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function of numerical priority values that control the orderings. For large-scale problems, the number of free parameters can be compressed by using a small neural network to assign priority values. Remarkably, both methods lead to IBP reduction schemes that are more efficient than human-designed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on the Shear Viscosity of Rotating Nuclear Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent observation of non-zero spin polarization and spin alignment of a few hadrons, the rotational aspect of quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions has attracted considerable interest. The present work explores the effect of the Coriolis force, arising due to this rotation, on the shear viscosity of the medium. Using the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory framework, we analyze the parallel (\(\eta_{||}/s\)), perpendicular (\(\eta_\perp/s\)) and Hall (\(\eta_\times/s\)) components of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio under rotation. The estimation of anisotropic shear viscosity components is carried out using hadron resonance gas degrees of freedom below the critical (transition) temperature and massless partonic degrees of freedom above this temperature. Our results show that rotation suppresses the shear viscosity of the medium, with the degree of suppression depending on the ratio between the relaxation time and the rotational period. In the context of realistic heavy-ion collision experiments, the temperature and angular velocity both decrease with time, and one can establish a connection between them through the standard approximate cooling law. For a temperature-dependent angular velocity \(\Omega(T)\), we obtain a traditional valley-like pattern for all components \(\eta_{||}/s\), \(\eta_\perp/s\) and \(\eta_\times/s\) with reduced magnitudes compared to the valley-like isotropic $\eta/s$ one encounters in the absence of rotation.</description>

      <title>Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>S-matrix on effective string and compactified membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding Nambu-Goto action near infinitely long string vacuum one can compute scattering amplitudes of 2d massless fields representing transverse string coordinates. As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, the resulting S-matrix is integrable, in agreement with the known free string spectrum and also with an interpretation of the static-gauge NG action as a $T\bar T$ deformation of a free massless theory. We consider a generalization of this computation to the case of a membrane, expanding its 3d action near an infinite membrane vacuum that has cylindrical $\mathbb R \times S^1$ shape (we refer to such membrane as "compactified"). Representing 3d fields as Fourier series in $S^1$ coordinate we get an effective 2d model in which the massless string modes are coupled to an infinite KK tower of massive 2d modes. We find that the resulting 2d S-matrix is not integrable already at the tree level. We also compute 1-loop scattering amplitude of massless string modes with all compactified membrane modes propagating in the loop. The result is UV finite and is a non-trivial function of the kinematic variables. In the large momentum limit or when the radius of $S^1$ is taken to infinity we recover the expression for the 1-loop scattering amplitude of the uncompactified $\mathbb R^2$ membrane. We also consider a 2d model which is the $T\bar T$ deformation to the free theory with the same massless plus infinite massive tower of modes. The corresponding 2d S-matrix is found, as expected, to be integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Poincar\'e invariance directly implies the existence of a complexified Minkowski space whose real and imaginary directions unify spacetime and spin, which we dub spinspacetime. Despite the intrinsic noncommutativity of spin, spinspacetime exhibits mutually commuting holomorphic coordinates. Its twistorial construction derives the Newman-Janis shift property of spinning black holes by massive half-Fourier transforming complexified on-shell kinematics, which encode a spinning analog of equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Global Symmetries, Code Ensembles, and Sums Over Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Abelian topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 3d and show that gaugings of invertible global symmetries naturally give rise to additive codes. These codes emerge as nonanomalous subgroups of the 1-form symmetry group, parameterizing the fusion rules of condensable TQFT anyons. The boundary theories dual to TQFTs with the anyons condensed, i.e. with the corresponding symmetry subgroup gauged, are "code" conformal field theories (CFTs). This observation bridges together, in the holographic sense, results on 1-form symmetries of 3d TQFTs with developments connecting codes to 2d CFTs. Building on this relationship, we proceed to consider the ensemble of maximal gaugings (topological boundary conditions) in a general, not necessarily Abelian 3d TQFT, and propose that the resulting ensemble of boundary CFTs has a holographic description as a gravitational theory -- the bulk TQFT summed over topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the details of the explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the constrained 3BF action representing the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity. First we discuss how each particular constraint breaks the original symmetry of the topological 3BF action. Then we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory in the constrained 3BF form, in order to demonstrate that they can indeed be performed in the framework of higher gauge theory. A formulation of the Proca action as a constrained 3BF theory is also studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress on the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics for black holes in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, we investiggate the hologrphic thermodynamics for the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Through the extended bulk thermodynamics for the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole, we derive the first law of the CFT thermodynamics which is obtained by directly translating the arbitrary conformal factors in the dual CFT. In addition to the newly defined chemical potential $\mu$ conjugating to the central charge $C$, we obtain other pairs of thermodynamics for the CFT, such as the temperature $\tilde{T}$ and the entropy $S$, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ and its conjugate variable $ \tilde{\mathcal{A}}$, the pressure $\mathcal{P}$ and its conjugate volume $\mathcal{V}$. In the fixed $C$, $\mathcal{V}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ canonical ensemble, we obtain the canonical description of the CFT thermodynamics and observe the standard swallowtail behavior in the Helmholtz free energy vs the temperature plot. The self-intersection point of the Helmholtz free energy indicates the phase transition between the high and low entropy states of the CFT. By using Maxwell's equal area law, we get the critical point and coexistence curve for the high and low entropy phases of the CFT. Besides, we get the critical exponents for the CFT, and find that the critical point and critical exponents associated with the $\tilde{T}-S$ criticality of the CFT are the same as those of the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler Equation from Effective Action: Implications for the Smarr Formula in AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes a geometrical scale of the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of well-established physics. Finally, our findings raise important questions regarding the validity of treating the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a thermodynamic variable, as proposed in certain frameworks within the literature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Kerr-AdS black hole from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the universal structure of the gravitational path integral beyond semi-classical saddles and uncovering a compelling statistical interpretation of black hole thermodynamics have long been significant challenges. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics through an ensemble-averaged theory. By extending the phase space to include all possible states with conical singularities in their Euclidean counterparts, we derive the probability distribution of different states inherited from the Euclidean gravitational path integral. Moreover, we can define a density matrix of all states in the phase space. By ensemble-averaging over all states, we show that the black hole phase transition naturally arises in the semi-classical limit. Away from the semi-classical regime, the ensemble-averaged theory exhibits a notable deviation from the conventional phase transition. Expanding around the classical saddles yields the subleading-order correction to the Gibbs free energy, which is half of the Hawking temperature. We demonstrate that the half Hawking temperature correction is a universal feature inherent to black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime. With the subleading-order correction to Gibbs free energy, we also suggest that the whole black hole thermodynamic should be corrected accordingly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric prescription for superstring amplitude computations is given using the pure spinor formalism which does not contain subtleties from poles in the pure spinor ghosts. This super-Poincare covariant prescription is related by a U(5)-covariant field redefinition to the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz amplitude prescription where the pure spinor parameterizes the choice of SO(10)/U(5). For F-term scattering amplitudes which preserve a subset of the spacetime supersymmetries, the new pure spinor amplitude prescription reduces to the previous pure spinor prescription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

Abstract: We construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. We couple an on-shell vector multiplet to the standard Weyl multiplet and use the field equations of the vector multiplet to replace some of the components of the auxiliary fields of the standard Weyl multiplet with the fields of the vector multiplet and some dual gauge fields. The R-symmetry of the multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$. Furthermore, we gauge fix one of the two $U(1)$ symmetries and rewrite the result for the dilaton Weyl multiplet with $SU(2) \times U(1)$ R-symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that multiple vertex operator algebras (VOAs) can arise from a single 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT). The connection is given by the BPS monodromy operator $M$, which is a wall-crossing invariant quantity that captures the BPS spectrum on the Coulomb branch. We find that the trace of the multiple powers of the monodromy operator $\mathrm{Tr} M^N$ produces the vacuum characters of a VOA for each $N$. In particular, we realize unitary VOAs of the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c exceptional series type $(A_2)_1$, $(G_2)_1$, $(D_4)_1$, $(F_4)_1$, $(E_6)_1$ from Argyres-Douglas theories. We also find the modular invariant characters of the `intermediate vertex subalgebra' $(E_{7\frac{1}{2}})_1$ and $(X_1)_1$. Our analysis allows us to construct 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories that flow to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs in the IR, which gives rise to the topological field theories realizing the VOAs with these characters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open string amplitudes at tree level have been studied for over fifty years, but there is no known analytic form for general $n$-point amplitudes, and their conventional representation in terms of worldsheet integrals does not make many of their most basic physical properties manifest. Recently, a formulation of these amplitudes exposing the underlying "binary geometry" via the use of "$u$" variables has given us many insights into their basic features. In this paper, we initiate a systematic exploration of fundamental aspects of open string amplitudes from this new point of view. We begin by giving explicit expressions for the factorization of amplitudes at general massive levels. We then study the asymptotic behavior when subsets of kinematic variables become large, delineating regimes with exponential (generalized hard scattering) and power-law (generalized Regge) behavior. We also give precise expressions for the asymptotics, which reveal another example of the recently observed property of factorization away from poles. We finally derive new recursion relations and infinite series representations for the amplitude, and for five points, we present a new closed-form expression for the amplitude that for the first time gives its analytic continuation to all of kinematic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular flows probe important aspects of the entanglement structures, especially those of QFTs, in a dynamical framework. Despite the expected non-local nature in the general cases, the majority of explicitly understood examples feature local space-time trajectories under modular flows. In this work, we study a particular class of non-local modular flows. They are associated with the relativistic vacuum state and sub-regions whose boundaries lie on a planar null-surface. They satisfy a remarkable algebraic property known as the half-sided modular inclusion, and as a result the modular Hamiltonians are exactly known in terms of the stress tensor operators. To be explicit, we focus on the simplest QFT of a massive or massless free scalar in $2+1$ dimensions. We obtain explicit expressions for the generators. They can be separated into a sum of local and non-local terms showing certain universal pattern. The preservation of von-Neumann algebra under modular flow works in a subtle way for the non-local terms. We derive a differential-integral equation for the finite modular flow, which can be analyzed in perturbation theory of small distance deviating from the entanglement boundary, and re-summation can be performed in appropriate limits. Comparison with the general expectation of modular flows in such limits are discussed.</description>

We study the scalar wave-form, the scalar memory term and classical soft scalar theorems. We ignore gravitational interactions and discuss the challenges for gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible supersymmetric extensions of the Carrollian algebra and the Carrollian conformal algebra in both $d=4$ and $d=3$. For the super-Carrollian algebra in $d=4$, we identify multiple admissible structures, depending on the representations of the supercharges with respect to the Carrollian rotation. Some of these structures can be derived by taking the speed of light $c\to 0$ limit from super-Poincar\'e algebra, but others are completely novel. In the conformal case, we demonstrate that the nontrivial Carrollian superconformal algebras for $d=4$ and $d=3$ are isomorphic to super-Poincar\'e algebra of $d=5$ and $d=4$ respectively. Remarkably, neither of these constructions requires R-symmetry to ensure the algebraic closure. Furthermore, we discover two distinct classes of super-BMS$_4$ algebras, i.e. one singlet super-BMS$_4$ algebra and two multiplet chiral super-BMS$_4$ algebras. The singlet case arises from extending the $3$D Carrollian superconformal algebra, whereas the multiplet cases do not admit this pathology due to their finite-dimensional subalgebra containing supercharges with conformal dimension $\Delta=\pm\frac{3}{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We uncover a geometric organization of the differential equations for the wavefunction coefficients of conformally coupled scalars in power-law cosmologies. To do this, we introduce a basis of functions inspired by a decomposition of the wavefunction into time-ordered components. Representing these basis functions and their singularities by graph tubings, we show that a remarkably simple rule for the merger of tubes produces the differential equations for arbitrary tree graphs (and loop integrands). We find that the basis functions can be assigned to the vertices, edges, and facets of convex geometries (in the simplest cases, collections of hypercubes) which capture the compatibility of mergers and define how the basis functions are coupled in the differential equations. This organization of functions also simplifies solving the differential equations. The merger of tubes is shown to reflect the causal properties of bulk physics, in particular the collapse of time-ordered propagators. Taken together, these observations demystify the origin of the kinematic flow observed in these equations [1].</description>

      <title>Towards the finite quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel regularization/renormalization scheme that utilizes an auxiliary Feynman parameterization. This approach is employed to align a specified loop diagram with a designated unit of the form $1=\lambda/\lambda$. Within the proposed regularization technique, we formulate the standard renormalization scheme and demonstrate conditions under which it yields symmetry preserving results. It is demonstrated that its minimal form yields renormalized diagrams that are equivalent to those of the dimensional renormalization scheme, with the exception of their counterterms. Furthermore, a novel procedure for taking the soft limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$, where a properly defined order of computational actions provides the field theory completely finite, is presented.The qualitative and quantitative distinctions between this approach and the standard scheme are highlighted. Both schemes are elucidated in the scalar model in 3+1D for pedagogical reasons. Subsequently, the proposed schemes are applied to the Standard Model at one loop level, e.g. we calculate photon and gluon polarizations. QCD effective charge is calculated in the finite QCD, exhibiting a clear evidence that the finite QCD is not ruled out but supported by experiment. In the final section, we offer a concise discussion on the softening of anomalies and the treatment of overlapping divergences, accompanied by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Local operators in the Sine-Gordon model: $\partial_\mu \phi \, \partial_\nu \phi$ and the stress tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the simplest non-trivial local composite operators in the massless Sine-Gordon model, which are $\partial_\mu \phi \, \partial_\nu \phi$ and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We show that even in the finite regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ of the theory, these operators need additional renormalisation (beyond the free-field normal-ordering) at each order in perturbation theory. We further prove convergence of the renormalised perturbative series for their expectation values, both in the Euclidean signature and in Minkowski space-time, and for the latter in an arbitrary Hadamard state. Lastly, we show that one must add a quantum correction (proportional to $\hbar$) to the renormalised stress tensor to obtain a conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression for Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Topological orders with classical Lie group symmetries from coupling electron wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological order that arises from chiral states with ${\rm SU}(N)$ or ${\rm SO}(N)$ edge-state symmetry. This extends our previous study of topological orders that descend from the bosonic $E_8$ quantum Hall state. We use exactly solvable models of coupled electron wires to construct states with ${\rm SU}(m)_n$, ${\rm SO}(m)_n$, or ${\rm Sp}(m)_n$ topological order for various levels $n$. We use our constructions to write down string operators for various non-Abelian anyons. We thereby provide a systematic, model derivation of quantum Hall states, topological superconductors, and spin liquids with emergent non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations, including those of Ising, metaplectic, and Fibonacci type.</description>

      <title>Tidal response beyond vacuum General Relativity with a canonical definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal effects on compact objects provide profound theoretical insights into the structure of the field equations, and are wonderful probes of the equation of state of matter, the nature of black holes and of the underlying theory of gravity. The natural framework for understanding tides is a perturbative scheme. Here, we point out ambiguities in determining tidal response functions within such a framework, which may lead to bias in constraining physical parameters with gravitational-wave observations if the computed quantities are not properly linked to observables. We propose a Canonical Tidal Response Function (CTRF) definition to compare values of tides in theories beyond vacuum General Relativity in a unified manner. As an example, we provide black hole tidal response functions, including both conservative and dissipative pieces, in various theories of gravity. Tidal dissipation Love numbers for black holes are derived here for the first time in most of the non-Einsteinian theories considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>
