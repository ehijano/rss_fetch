      <title>Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Crescent domain-wall pairs in anisotropic two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with fast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controllable and efficient manipulation is always a key challenge for the application of topological magnetic textures in spintronic devices. By first-principles calculations and atomistic simulations, the present work reveals an exotic domain-wall pair in crescent shape, which possesses topology in one dimension and particle-like robustness in two dimensions. Its antiferromagnetic version is observed in the two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with a strong anisotropy, and the ferromagnetic version exists under an appropriate strain. Both of them can be driven efficiently by current to move in a straight line along a certain direction. Hereby, another possible path is provided to realize the application of topological magnetic texture in the next-generation high-speed spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>MatTools: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Science Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.</description>

      <title>Beyond surfaces: quantifying internal radiative heat transport in dense materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Surface coupling of NV centers over nanoscale lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond are among the most promising quantum sensors, offering high sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution. These systems are, however, prone to decoherence due to coupling with surface states. Here, we study sub-surface NV- centers embedded into large diamond slabs (8 nm) using various surface orientations (100 and 111) and terminations (hydrogen and nitrogen terminators) and compute the quasiparticle states of the defect. Our results show how dynamical charge fluctuations near the surface influence defect stability. We find that the (100) N-terminated surface introduces strong surface-state instabilities, while the (111) N-terminated surface provides a more favorable configuration. However, many-body calculations (within the GW approximation) reveal that defects placed shallower than ~ 4 nm are prone to surface-induced ionization. These findings establish an accurate theoretical limit on the minimum depth required for stable NV- centers, guiding the design of NV- based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay Between Formation Mechanisms and Luminescence of Lignin Carbon Quantum Dots from Spruce Biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between the formation mechanisms and luminescent properties of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots (LG-CQDs) synthesized from spruce biomass by hydrothermal treatment. A comprehensive understanding of LG-CQD structure and its photoluminescence requires insights into the native architecture of lignin and the distribution of its acidolysis-derived fragments. Research showed how these lignin-derived units interact with dopant molecules in three different approaches during synthesis, contributing to core and surface structures that govern the optical behavior. Our findings reveal a clear correlation between structural features and luminescent properties, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in tuning emission characteristics. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of LG-CQDs with tailored luminescent properties, advancing their potential applications in sustainable optoelectronics, sensing, and bioimaging.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>An approach for thermal conductivity measurements in thin films: Combining localized surface topography, thermal analysis, and machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for determining the thermal conductivity (TC) of materials with high reliability. The methodology addresses issues such as surface topographical variations and substrate interference by combining Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) with machine learning (ML) models and normalization techniques. Micro- and nanostructural variations in thin films exacerbate measurement inconsistencies, reducing repeatability and reliability. These interconnected challenges highlight the need for a novel, flexible, and adaptive methodology that can comprehensively address the complexities of thin film characterization while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. In this approach, sample surface was divided into fine spatial grids for localized thermal and topographical measurements. A substrate-thickness factor (C factor) was introduced to account for thickness and substrate effects on thin film TC, and high-performance Random Forest regression was used to predict TC across a broad range of materials. The models were trained on a dataset of 2,352 measurements that covered a wide range of material properties and then validated with an additional 980 measurements. They achieved high predictive accuracy, with a $R^2$ of 0.97886 during training and 0.96630 during testing. This approach addresses instrumental limitations and integrates experimental techniques with computational modeling, providing a scalable framework for a wide range of material science applications.</description>

      <title>Novel high symmetry super-hard C48 and C32 allotropes with ana and ukc original topologies: Crystal chemistry and DFT investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel high symmetry body centered carbon allotropes: cubic C48 and tetragonal C32 are proposed with respective original ana and ukc topologies. Devised from crystal structure engineering, their ground state structures and energy derived physical properties were accurately derived based on quantum mechanics calculations within the density functional theory DFT. Both allotropes made of distorted tetrahedral C4 arrangements were found dense with rho larger than 3g.cm-3 that remain lower than diamond (rho = 3.50 g.cm-3). With cohesive albeit with metastable ground state structures, both allotropes show stability from the mechanical (elastic properties) and dynamic (phonons band structures) properties. Vickers hardness magnitudes HV(C48) =47 GPa and HV(C32) = 59 GPa point to super-hard materials. The electronic band structures range from large direct band gap close to 5 eV for C48 to indirect band gap close to 2.5 eV semi-conducting C32. Such findings of original allotropes with targeted physical properties are bound to enrich the field of research on carbon.</description>

      <title>Exploration of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as cathode for magnesium batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of energy storage technologies that can exhibit higher energy densities, better safety, and lower supply-chain constraints than the current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for our transition into sustainable energy use. In this context, Mg batteries (MBs) offer a promising pathway to design energy storage systems with superior volumetric energy densities than LIBs but require the development of positive electrodes (cathodes) exhibiting high energy and power densities. Notably, amorphous materials that lack long range order can exhibit `flatter' potential energy surfaces than crystalline frameworks, possibly resulting in faster Mg$^{2+}$ motion. Here, we use a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) based calculations to explore amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a potential cathode for MBs. Using an AIMD-generated dataset, we train and validate moment tensor potentials that can accurately model amorphous (Mg)V$_2$O$_5$ Due to the amorphization of V$_2$O$_5$, we observe a 10-14% drop in the average Mg intercalation voltage $-$ but the voltage remains higher than sulfide Mg cathodes. Importantly, we find a $\sim$seven (five) orders of magnitude higher Mg$^{2+}$ diffusivity in amorphous MgV$_2$O$_5$ than its crystalline version (thiospinel-Mg$_x$Ti$_2$S$_4$), which is directly attributable to the amorphization of the structure. Also, we note the Mg$^{2+}$ motion in the amorphous structure is significantly cross-correlated at low temperatures, with the correlation decreasing with increase in temperature. Thus, our work highlights the potential of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a cathode that can exhibit both high energy and power densities, resulting in the practical deployment of MBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have designed a system enabling tuning Casimir attraction/repulsion transitions between a polystyrene sphere attached to an atomic force microscope tip near a Teflon surface in a magnetic fluid mixture. Notably, the trapping distances can be changed by several orders of magnitude by changes in zero-frequency transverse electric contributions to the Casimir force. We demonstrate that this can be achieved via modifications in the average diameter for the magnetite particles while keeping the magnetite volume fractions fixed.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved electron dynamics in antiferromagnetic CoO(001) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin antiferromagnetic CoO(001)-(1x1) films of 2 and 4 monolayers (ML) on Ag(001) are investigated by time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoelectron (2PPE) spectroscopy. Pump-probe spectra show unoccupied states between 3.6 and 4.0\,eV above the Fermi level ($E_{F}$), which are identified as image potential states with momentum-dependent lifetimes between 12 to 20\,fs. Electrons photoexcited across the band gap show lifetimes of 27\,fs at the bottom of the Co $3d$ $t_{2g}$-derived conduction band minimum. This lifetime is much shorter than in conventional semiconductors. Our observations point either to strong electron correlation effects as has been demonstrated for NiO or to an ultrafast relaxation pathway via metallic substrate states.</description>

      <title>Space Group Equivariant Crystal Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group invariant likelihoods. SGEquiDiff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a polar phase in WO3 thin films by epitaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of new simple oxides that are CMOS-compatible constitutes an important step towards multifunctional oxide electronics. One such oxide, tungsten trioxide (WO3), has raised much interest as an electrode material. Here we reveal the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of WO3, obtained in thin films grown on YAlO3 substrates. The epitaxial strain stabilizes a triclinic phase, whose unit cell could be fully determined by means of large-scale reciprocal space mapping, rarely reported in thin films.
  Unconventional strain accommodation mechanisms enable the triclinic phase to be stabilized up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. The strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts, observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, could explain this behavior.
  An in-plane striped domain pattern with needle-like bifurcations is visible in piezoresponse force microscopy maps, evidencing the polar nature of the films. Correspondingly, local modulations of the conductivity of the film are shown by conductive atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These results open the possibility for adding functionalities to WO3-based devices by controlling conductivity and epitaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Scalable thru-hole epitaxy of GaN through self-adjusting $h$-BN masks via solution-processed 2D stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective epitaxy on 2D-material masks is a promising pathway for achieving localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth, but conventional 2D transfer processes limit scalability and interface control. Here, we demonstrate a thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method that enables vertically connected and laterally overgrown GaN domains through a spin-coated, solution-processed stack of hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) flakes. The disordered $h$-BN mask exhibits a self-adjusting structure during growth, which locally reconfigures to allow percolative precursor transport and coherent GaN nucleation beneath otherwise blocking layers. Comprehensive structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy, Raman mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirm both the presence of epitaxial GaN beneath the h-BN and suppression of threading dislocations. This strategy eliminates the need for patterned 2D mask transfers and demonstrates a scalable route to selective-area GaN growth on arbitrary substrates, relevant to future micro-LED and photonic integration platforms.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quasi-Statically Screened Electron-Polar Optical Phonon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of electrons with polar optical phonons (POP) is an important mechanism that limits electronic transport and determines electron mobility in polar materials. This is typically a stronger mechanism compared to non-polar acoustic and optical phonon scattering, and of similar strength to the Coulomb ionized impurity scattering. At high densities, on the other hand, the cloud of charge carriers screens the dipoles that are responsible for POP scattering, and weakens the electron-POP scattering strength. However, in contrast to ionized impurity scattering, for which the well-known Brooks-Herring equation provides the scattering rates with the effect of screening included, for scattering with POP there is no such closed-form mathematical expression. In this work, we derive such an expression based on Fermi's Golden Rule, which would prove particularly useful in understanding electronic transport in complex crystal and complex band structure materials, in which electron-POP scattering could dominate electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Combined Experimental and Computational Analysis of Lithium Diffusion in Isostructural Pair VNb9O25 and VTa9O25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wadsley-Roth crystal structures are an attractive class of materials for batteries because lithium diffusion is facilitated by the ReO3-like block structure with electron transport enabled by edge-sharing along shear planes. However, clear structure-property relationships remain limited, making it challenging to develop improved materials. Here, the first lithiation of VTa9O25 is reported, enabling a direct isostructural comparison with the better-known VNb9O25. These materials have similar unit cell volumes and atomic radii yet exhibit different voltage windows, C-rate dependent capacities, and transport metrics. Time-dependent overpotential analysis reveals ionic diffusion as the primary bottleneck to high rate-performance in both cases, however, the lithium diffusivity for VNb9O25 was an order of magnitude faster than that for VTa9O25. These experimental trends aligned well with density functional theory calculations combined with molecular dynamics that show a factor of six faster diffusion in VNb9O25. Nudged elastic band calculations of the probable hopping pathways indicate that VNb9O25 consistently exhibits a lower activation barrier for lithium diffusion. Bader charge analysis reveals a larger net charge on Li in VNb9O25 due to the higher electronegativity of Nb which stabilizes the transition state and lowers the barrier. This stabilization arises from the stronger Coulombic interaction between Li and its coordinated O-environment. These materials behave similarly upon lithiation wherein the lattice vectors (corresponding to the block plane) increase until about 50% lithiation and then decrease. However, the electronic structure differs, indicating that VNb9O25 undergoes a insulator to metal transition at a lower state of charge compared with VTa9O25. Overall, this work establishes the role of the cation (Nb or Ta) on the electronic and transport properties during lithiation.</description>

      <title>Magnetostriction and Temperature Dependent Gilbert Damping in Boron Doped Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films with strong magnetoelastic coupling and low Gilbert damping are key materials for many magnetoelectric devices. Here, we investigated the effects of boron doping concentration on magnetostriction and temperature dependent Gilbert damping in magnetron sputtered (Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$)$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ films. A crystalline to amorphous structural transition was observed for a boron content near 8% and coincided with a decrease in coercivity from 76 Oe to 3 Oe. A 10% doping concentration is optimal for achieving both large magnetostriction of 48.8 ppm and low Gilbert damping of $6 \times 10^{-3}$. The temperature dependence of the damping shows an increase at low temperatures with a peak around 40 K and we associate the relative increase $\Delta\alpha/\alpha_{RT}$ with magnetoelastic contributions to the damping, which has a maximum of 55.7% at 8% boron. An increase in the inhomogeneous linewidth broadening was observed in the structural transition regime at about 8% boron concentration. This study suggests that incorporation of glass forming elements, in this case boron, into Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$ is a practical pathway for simultaneously achieving enhanced magnetoelastic coupling and reduced Gilbert damping.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C cathode for low-cost sodium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a newly designed NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C composite material as a cathode for cost-effective sodium-ion batteries. A novel strategy of small Mo doping successfully stabilizes the sample having high Mn content in single phase rhombohedral symmerty. The high-resolution microscopy analysis reveals nanocrystallites of around $\sim$18 nm, uniformly embedded within the semi-graphitic carbon matrix, which enhances the surface electronic conductivity and effectively shortens the sodium-ion diffusion path. More importantly, we demonstrate a stable electrochemical behavior, with enhanced discharge capacity of 124 mAh/g at 0.1 C, having good reversibility and retaining 77\% of its capacity after 300 cycles, and 70\% even after 400 cycles at 2 C. The sodium-ion diffusion coefficients, estimated using both galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry are found to lie within the range of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$~cm$^2$/s. Additionally, the bond-valence site energy mapping predicted a sodium-ion migration energy barrier of 0.76 eV. A detailed distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis is used to deconvolute the electrochemical impedance spectra into distinct processes based on their characteristic relaxation times. Notably, the solid-state diffusion of sodium ions within the bulk electrode, with a relaxation time of $\sim$50 s, shows a consistent trend with the diffusion coefficients obtained from GITT and Warburg-based evaluations across the state of charge.</description>

      <title>Is diamagnetism really acausal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamagnetism, in which the magnetisation in a medium opposes the direction of an applied magnetic field, is a weak but familiar effect in a wide class of materials. Being weak it is also a linear response to any applied field. The problem is that the existence of diamagnetism is in direct conflict with the requirements of causality as embodied in the familiar Kramers-Kronig relations. Nature does not care about our confusion and diamagnetism exists and physics is constrained by the requirements of causality (that effect cannot precede its cause). This puzzle has received intermittent attention from time to time, with a variety of arguments made to resolve the paradox. None of these, no matter how plausible, reveal the mechanism that resolves the existence of diamagnetism without sacrificing causality. The full resolution is presented in this letter.</description>

      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

Abstract: We present a laser reaction chamber that we developed for in-situ/operando X-ray diffraction measurements at the NSLS-II 28-ID-2 XPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction) beamline. This chamber allows for rapid and dynamic sample heating under specialized gas environments, spanning ambient conditions down to vacuum pressures. We demonstrate the capabilities of this setup through two applications: laser-driven heating in polycrystalline iron oxide and in single crystal WTe2. Our measurements reveal the ability to resolve chemical reaction kinetics over minutes with 1-s time resolution. This setup advances opportunities for in-situ/operando XRD studies in both bulk and single crystal materials.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials, specifically transition metal dichalcogenides, for highly sensitive gas sensing are emerging as effective detection technology. Platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) is an intriguing material in the realm of field-effect transistors (FETs) due to its unique electronic properties. In this study, the CVDsynthesized PtTe2 was functionalized with Au-Pd thin film for analyte-specific (H2S) sensing for better toxic gas sensitivity and selectivity. It was concluded that PtTe2, in combination with appropriate metal or oxide decorations, had great potential for ultrasensitive and selective, real-time gas sensor applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an integrated switch that combines plasmonic and neuromorphic technologies with a single sub-stoichiometric VO2-x nanoparticle. The presented device acts as a versatile plasmonic switch with dual thermal and electrical reconfigurability leveraging the near-room temperature phase transition of the VO2-x nanoparticles combined with the rapid phase recovery to drive the device. The change in both the optical and electrical properties of the VO2-x nanoparticle enables simultaneous optical and electrical readouts making the plasmonic device suitable as a phase change memory cell which is crucial in the convergence of computing and communication technologies. Our demonstration of reversible electrical switching, evidenced by a 6dB modulation depth and concurrent optical and electrical outputs, signifies a major stride in merging electronic and photonic functionalities within phase-change material devices. This novel strategy not only harmonizes optical communication with electronic computing but also advances the development of sophisticated integrated neuromorphic devices.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic Kagome materials are a promising platform to study the interplay between magnetism, topology, and correlated electronic phenomena. Among these materials, the RTi3Bi4 family received a great deal of attention recently because of its chemical versatility and wide range of magnetic properties. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of TbTi3Bi4 in paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Our experimental results show the presence of unidirectional band splitting of unknown nature in both phases. In addition, we observed a complex reconstruction of the band structure in the antiferromagnetic phase. Some aspects of this reconstruction are consistent with effects of additional periodicity introduced by the magnetic ordering vector, while the nature of several other features remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced evolution of anisotropic superconductivity and Fermi surface nesting in a ternary boride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity of a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. The robust coupling between $\mathrm{\sigma}$-bonding states, primarily created by the d-orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms, facilitates the generation of cooper pairs that make $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$ a single-gap anisotropic superconductor with a critical temperature ($\mathrm{T_c}\sim ) \, 19.3$ K. A weak Fermi surface nesting and the low value of electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, the system is readily tunable by hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and negative formation energy. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes leads to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden improvement in the nesting condition. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.</description>

      <title>Inelastic tunneling into multipolaronic bound states in single-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the interaction of electrons or holes with lattice vibrations. Though polarons are well-studied across multiple disciplines, experimental observations of polarons in two-dimensional crystals are sparse. We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to measure inelastic excitations of polaronic bound states emerging from coupling of non-polar zone-boundary phonons to Bloch electrons in n-doped metallic single-layer MoS$_2$. The latter is kept chemically pristine via contactless chemical doping. Tunneling into the vibrationally coupled polaronic states leads to a series of evenly spaced peaks in the differential conductance on either side of the Fermi level. Combining density functional (perturbation) theory with a recently developed ab initio electron-lattice downfolding technique, we show that the energy spacing stems from the longitudinal-acoustic phonon mode that flattens at the Brillouin zone edge and is responsible for the formation of stable multipolarons in metallic MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport signatures of spin-orbit coupling in high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin transport in superconductors offers a compelling platform to merge the dissipationless nature of superconductivity with the functional promise of spin-based electronics. A significant challenge in achieving spin polarisation in conventional superconductors stems from the singlet state of Cooper pairs, which exhibit no net spin. The generation of spin-polarised carriers, quasiparticles, or triplet pairs in superconductors has predominantly been realised in hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet systems through proximity-induced spin polarisation. Historically, cuprate superconductors have been characterised by strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report exceptionally large anisotropic magnetoresistance and a pronounced planar Hall effect arising near the superconducting phase transition in the prototypical high-temperature cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x without using a proximity ferromagnet. These effects, unprecedented in centrosymmetric cuprates, emerge from spin-polarised quasiparticle transport mediated by strong spin-orbit coupling. By systematically tuning magnetic field strength, orientation, temperature, and doping, we show clear evidence of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in a material class long thought to lack such interactions. Our findings reveal an unexpected spin-orbit landscape in cuprates and open a route to engineer spintronic functionalities in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Neutron Spin Resonance Near a Lifshitz Transition in Overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the relationship between spin excitations and fermiology is essential for clarifying the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on the hole overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ near a Lifshitz transition, where the electron pocket at $M$ point is nearly replace by four hole pockets. In the normal state, the spin excitations are observed at incommensurate wave vectors with chimney-like dispersions. By cooling down to the superconducting state, a neutron spin resonance mode emerges with a peak energy of $E_r=$ 14-15 meV weakly modulated along $L$-direction. The incommensurability notably increases at low energies, giving rise to downward dispersions of the resonance mode. This behavior contrasts sharply with the upward dispersions of resonance observed in optimally doped Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ contributed by the hole to electron scattering, but resembles with the cases in KFe$_2$As$_2$ and KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ where the fermiology are dominated by hole pockets. These results highlight the critical role of electronic structure modifications near the Fermi level, especially in governing interband scattering under imperfect nesting conditions, which fundamentally shape the spin dynamics of FeSCs.</description>

      <title>ForgetMeNot: Understanding and Modeling the Impact of Forever Chemicals Toward Sustainable Large-Scale Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorinated compounds, often referred to as forever chemicals, are critical in various steps of semiconductor fabrication like lithography, etching, chamber cleaning, and others. Forever chemical emissions can exhibit global warming potentials thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide and persist in the atmosphere for millennia. Despite their severe impact, most sustainability works in computer systems have focused on carbon emissions alone. We address this gap by introducing ForgetMeNot, a modeling tool that quantifies fluorinated compound emissions by integrating fabrication facility-specific practices and hardware specifications, and validate its accuracy using real-world emission data from fabrication facilities. We show how ForgetMeNot can enable fabrication facilities to optimize design and material usage decisions for emission reduction and provide researchers with a methodology to calibrate emission estimates for hardware designs. When ForgetMeNot is applied to analyze emissions for manufacturing CPUs, DRAM, and storage, it illustrates how hardware generations, lithography techniques, and capacities impact fluorinated compound emissions. Finally, we demonstrate how datacenter operators can assemble low-emission servers while balancing performance demands. By factoring in fluorinated emissions into manufacturing decisions, ForgetMeNot paves the way for building more sustainable systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams, tricriticality, and spin-reorientation in high-pressure grown SmCrO$_3$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SmCrO$_3$ single crystals were successfully grown utilizing the high-pressure optical floating-zone method and their crystal structure, magnetization behavior, and magnetic phase diagrams were thoroughly investigated. Magnetic studies were conducted for fields applied along all principal crystallographic directions, with measurements taken at temperatures as low as 0.4 K and magnetic fields up to 14 T. The single crystal growth parameters are reported and the orthorhombic structure with the centrosymmetric space group $Pbnm$ is confirmed. Long-range order of the Cr$^{3+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ magnetic sublattices evolves at $T_{\rm N}$ = 192 K and $T_{\rm N2}$=3 K, respectively. In contrast to previous studies on polycrystals our single crystal data imply a discontinuous and one-step spin-reorientation (SR) of net magnetic moments $\tilde{M}$ from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane at zero magnetic field at $T_{\rm SR}$=33 K. Its discontinuous nature is maintained if $B$ is applied $||c$ axis but tricritical behavior and a triple point is found for $B||a$ axis. While our data are consistent with the magnetic representation $\Gamma_4$ for $T &gt; T_{\mathrm {SR}}$, the size and in-plane direction of the observed net magnetic moment disagree to previously proposed spin configurations, i.e., $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, for the spin-reoriented phases. In general, our high-quality single crystals enable us to revisit the phase diagram and to clarify the complex magnetism in SmCrO3 arising from the interplay of anisotropic 3$d$ and 4$f$ magnetic sublattices.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in the Superconductor NiBi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NiBi$_{3}$ compound exhibits an intriguing interplay of superconductivity, magnetism, and topology. While the possibility of unconventional superconductivity involving magnetic interactions has been previously discussed and dismissed, the topological character of its electronic structure has only recently gained attention. Here, we report experimental evidence of unconventional magnetic ordering in high-quality single crystals of NiBi$_{3}$, revealed through detailed magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistance shows a distinct temperature dependence, combining a classical Lorentz-like component with a linear-in-field contribution. Moreover, anomalous Hall effect signals persist down to the superconducting transition and vanish above 75 K. These results indicate that spin textures significantly influence charge transport in NiBi$_{3}$, pointing to a compensated magnetic background intertwined with its topological electronic structure. Our findings underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of this material.</description>

      <title>Born-limit scattering and pair-breaking crossover in d-wave superconductivity of (TMTSF)2ClO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quasi-one-dimensional organic unconventional superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, the randomness of the non-centrosymmetric ClO4 anions can be experimentally controlled by adjusting the cooling rate through the anion-ordering temperature. This feature provides a unique opportunity to study disorder effects on unconventional superconductivity in great detail. We here report on measurements of the electronic specific heat of this system, performed under various cooling rates. The evolution of the residual density of states indicates that the ClO4 randomness works as Born-limit pair breakers, which, to our knowledge, has never been clearly identified in any unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, detailed analyses suggest a peculiar crossover from strong unitarity scattering due to molecular defects toward the Born-limit weak scattering due to borders of ordered regions. This work supports the d-wave nature of pairing in (TMTSF)2ClO4 and intends to provide an experimental basis for further developments of pair-breaking theories of unconventional superconductors where multiple electron scattering mechanisms coexist.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spectroscopic Probes of Topology: A Velocity-Gauge Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a velocity-gauge formalism for computing nonlinear current response functions in periodic systems and apply it to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as a minimal topological testbed. By retaining the full minimal coupling Hamiltonian and avoiding the rotating wave approximation, we construct gauge-consistent expressions for the linear and third-order current susceptibilities using retarded Green's functions. Our results reveal how nonlinear optical spectra encode not only energy-level transitions but also interband phase coherence and topological winding. In the topological phase, the third-order response exhibits characteristic phase inversions and spectral asymmetries that are absent in the trivial phase. These features reflect geometric changes in the Bloch eigenstates and highlight the role of virtual pathways in shaping the nonlinear signal. Our framework offers a robust and extensible platform for modeling nonlinear light-matter interactions in topological materials beyond the dipole approximation and the standard Coulomb-gauge formulation in molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Ferromagnetism in Monolayer Cr2Te3 via Topological Insulator Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating SrTiO3(111) and/or Al2O3(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism persists in the 2D limit. In particular, the Curie temperature TC of 2 ML Cr2Te3 increases from 100 K to ~ 120 K when proximitized to topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, with substantially boosted magnetization as observed via polarized neutron reflectometry. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely universal underlying TC enhancement in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantum hybrid studies, including paving the way to realize interface-modulated topological electronics.</description>

Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on pinned mean curvature flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a simple quantitative model for the Frank--Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and ``topological cutting'' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank--Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank--Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy. This allows to derive an emergent law about the length of dislocation line generated per shear energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon-phonon interactions are fundamental to understanding a wide range of material properties, including thermal transport and vibrational spectra. In conventional perturbative approaches, energy conservation during each microscopic phonon interaction is enforced using delta functions. We demonstrate that these delta functions stem from an incomplete treatment, that violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem governing systems at equilibrium. By replacing delta functions with convolutions and introducing a self-consistency condition for the phonon spectral function, we provide a more accurate and physically consistent framework. For systems where phonon dynamics can be approximated as Markovian, we simplify this approach, reducing the dissipative component to a single parameter tied to phonon lifetimes. Applying this method to boron arsenide, we find that self-consistent linewidths better capture the phonon scattering processes, significantly improving agreement with experimental thermal conductivity values. These results also challenge the conventional view of four-phonon processes as dominant in BAs, demonstrating the adequacy of a three-phonon description, provided it is self-consistent. With this method we address critical limitations of perturbative approaches, offering new insights into dissipation and phonon-mediated processes, and enabling more accurate modeling of anharmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement</title>

Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation provides a powerful route for accessing emergent quantum phases far from equilibrium, enabling transient light-induced phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. However, extending this approach to induce topological phases, especially in conventional semiconductors, remains challenging. Here, we report the observation of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in the layered semiconductor SnSe, a trivial insulator with a sizable (~ 0.8 eV) band gap, induced by femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly reveals the sub-picosecond emergence of Dirac-like linear dispersions within the band gap. Their features, including a high Fermi velocity (~ 2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, are consistent with mirror-symmetry-protected surface states of a topological crystalline insulator. The observed spectral dynamics, combined with density functional theory calculations, indicate that the femtosecond excitation transiently increases lattice symmetry, enabling topological crystalline order to emerge. Our discovery opens new avenues for ultrafast optical control of topological quantum phases in semiconductors, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Texture- and Stress-Dependent Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectric PZT: Insights from a Micromechanical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromechanical response of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is strongly influenced by crystallographic texture and residual stress, both of which affect domain switching behavior. While these effects are critical for optimizing sensors, actuators, and MEMS devices, their combined influence remains poorly understood. We present a computational micromechanical model that captures texture- and stress-dependent polarization switching in MPB PZT. The framework incorporates both tetragonal and rhombohedral domain switching, along with interphase transformations, enabling accurate simulation of nonlinear electromechanical behavior. The model reproduces key experimental trends, including enhanced piezoelectric response in (001)-textured ceramics, and degradation under high in-plane stress. The implementation, provided as open-source MATLAB code, offers an accessible platform for experimentalists and materials designers to explore and interpret electromechanical behavior. By linking microstructural orientation and stress state to macroscopic response, this work provides a practical tool for understanding and designing next-generation piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: We predict the magnetic and electronic properties of a novel metal-organic framework. By combining density functional theory and density matrix renormalization group approaches, we find the diatomic Kagome crystal structure of the metal-semiquinoid framework (H$_2$NMe$_2$)$_2$M$_2$(Cl$_2$dhbq)$_3$ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to host a rich variety of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Dirac semimetallic, spin-polarized and unpolarized Dirac fermions, along with metallic phases and flat band magnetic insulators. Concomitantly, the spin excitation spectrum of the various magnetic systems display multiple Dirac-like and nodal-ring crossings. This suggests that the metal-semiquinoid system is an ideal platform for examining the intertwining of Dirac fermions and magnons.</description>

      <title>Fermionized dual vortex theory for magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent quantum oscillation measurement on the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet in finite magnetic fields, we raise the question about the physical contents of the emergent fermions and the gauge fields if the U(1) spin liquid is relevant for the finite-field kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet. Clearly, the magnetic field is non-perturbative in this regime, and the finite-field state has no direct relation with the U(1) Dirac spin liquid proposal at zero field. We here consider the fermionized dual vortex liquid state as one possible candidate theory to understand the magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid. Within the dual vortex theory, the $S^z$ magnetization is the emergent U(1) gauge flux, and the fermionized dual vortex is the emergent fermion. The magnetic field polarizes the spin component that modulates the U(1) gauge flux for the fermionized vortices and generates the quantum oscillation. Within the mean-field theory, we discuss the gauge field correlation, the vortex-antivortex continuum and the vortex thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquid state in the emergent honeycomb-lattice material TbBO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical spin liquid state, owing to spin frustration between classical Ising spins on triangular motifs and interplay between competing degrees of freedom, is characterized by a macroscopically degenerate ground state and topological excitations linked to emergent gauge theories. Here, by using thermodynamic and local-probe measurements down to 16 mK, we demonstrate the exotic magnetism and spin dynamics in the nearly perfect honeycomb lattice material TbBO3. The latter embodies a frustrated lattice with a superimposed triangular lattice, constituted by additional Tb3+ ions at the center of each hexagon. Thermodynamic experiments reveal the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange and significant dipolar interactions. Despite sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Tb3+ moments, muon-spin relaxation does not detect any signatures of long-range magnetic order or spin freezing down to 16 mK, corroborating the specific heat and ac susceptibility down to 45 mK. This suggests that the spin-orbit driven anisotropic exchange interaction engenders a strong frustration, crucial to induce a persistent spin dynamics. The scaling of muon relaxation rate as a function of the characteristic energy scale for several spin-liquid candidates, including TbBO3, demonstrates that a common underlying mechanism is at play. This is consistent with the NMR results on TbBO3 and reminiscent of a universal spin-liquid behavior, here attributed to dominant antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, confirmed by the presence of a broad magnetic diffuse scattering in the elastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering at Q=1.03 Ang^-1 at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that TbBO3 hosts a classical spin liquid induced by spin-orbit driven anisotropy on a frustrated honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets based on the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a fertile platform for realizing nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. Recently, several decorated square-kagome compounds of the nabokoite family have been synthesized, allowing for experimental exploration of model Hamiltonians. Here, we carry out a theoretical analysis of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl nabokoite using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian derived from density functional theory energy mapping. We employ classical Monte Carlo simulations to explain the two transitions experimentally observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve. Interestingly, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. Finally, we assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method.</description>

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>34 Examples of LLM Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry: Towards Automation, Assistants, Agents, and Accelerated Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using Brillouin light scattering by magnons without phase singularities. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>
