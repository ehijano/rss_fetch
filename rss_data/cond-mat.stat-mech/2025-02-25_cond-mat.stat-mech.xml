      <title>Statistical density of particles in one dimensional interaction and Jellium Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $n$ charged particles confined by a potential and interacting through the Riesz potential or a more general potential. In equilibrium, and for symmetric potential the particles arrange themselves symmetrically around the origin within a finite region. Various models will be studied by modifying both the confining potential and the interaction potential. Focusing on the statistical properties of the system, we analyze the position of the rightmost particle, $x_{\text{max}}$, and show that its typical fluctuations are described by a limiting distribution different from the Tracy-Widom distribution found in the one-dimensional log-gas. We also derive the large deviation functions governing the atypical fluctuations of $x_{\text{max}}$ far from its mean.</description>

      <title>Lifted TASEP: long-time dynamics,generalizations, and continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lifted TASEP and its generalization, the GL-TASEP. We analyze the spectral properties of the transition matrix of the lifted TASEP using its Bethe ansatz solution, and use them to determine the scaling of the relaxation time (the inverse spectral gap) with particle number. The observed scaling with particle number was previously found to disagree with Monte Carlo simulations of the equilibrium autocorrelation times of the structure factor and of other large-scale density correlators for a particular value of the pullback $\alpha_{\rm crit}$. We explain this discrepancy. We then construct the continuum limit of the lifted TASEP, which remains integrable, and connect it to the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The critical pullback $\alpha_{\rm crit}$ then equals the system pressure. We generalize the lifted TASEP to a large class of nearest-neighbor interactions, which lead to stationary states characterized by non-trivial Boltzmann distributions. By tuning the pullback parameter in the GL-TASEP to a particular value we can again achieve a polynomial speedup in the time required to converge to the steady state. We comment on the possible integrability of the GL-TASEP.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Ising Transition in Diffusive Sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimally stable site (MSS) clusters play a dominant role in shaping avalanches in the self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The manipulation of MSS clusters through local smoothings (diffusion) alter the MSS landscape, suppressing rare avalanches and postponing them until they manifest as spanning avalanches. By leveraging the Inverse Ising problem, we uncover a duality between diffusive sandpiles and equilibrium statistical physics. Our analysis reveals an emergent magnetic instability in the dual Ising model, coinciding with the formation of spanning avalanches and marking a transition to a correlated percolation regime. At this point, the MSS loop soups exhibit fractal self-similarity and power-law distributions, while the effective pairwise interactions in the dual system vanish, signaling a magnetic transition characterized by abrupt changes in magnetization and spin susceptibility. Crucially, we show that diffusion fundamentally reshapes avalanche dynamics: the spatial anti-correlations of MSSs in standard SOC systems transform into positive correlations when diffusion is introduced. These findings bridge self-organized criticality, percolation theory, and equilibrium phase transitions, shedding new light on emergent criticality and large-scale correlations in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the coarse-grained particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Stable time rondeau crystals in dissipative many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>A closed quantum system giving ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [This is the unpublished supplemental information from 1989 to the paper: J.M. Deutsch, "Quantum statistical mechanics in a closed system." Phys. Rev. A, 43(4), 2046 (1991).]
  A closed quantum mechanical system does not necessarily give time averages in accordance with the microcanonical distribution. This question is investigated if the number of degrees of freedom N is large. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, experimental situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical mechanical rules. It is shown that by applying a finite but very small perturbation to such systems, the results of quantum statistical mechanics can indeed be recovered. The form of the perturbation is that of a banded random matrix, which has been used previously to describe strongly chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. The properties of energy eigenfunctions for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the limit of large N.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Polydisperse Achiral Near-Rigid Nematogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding chirality transfer from the molecular to the macroscopic scale poses a significant challenge in soft and biological condensed matter physics. Many nanorods of biological origin not only have chiral molecular features but also exhibit a spread in contour length leading to considerable size dispersity. On top of this, random backbone fluctuations are ubiquitous for non-rigid particles but their role in chirality transfer remains difficult to disentangle from that of their native chirality imparted by their effective shape or surface architecture. We report spontaneous entropy-driven chiral symmetry breaking from molecular simulations of cholesteric liquid-crystals formed from achiral bead-spring rods with a continuous spread in contour length and marginal chain bending. The symmetry-breaking is caused by long-lived chiral conformations of long rods undergoing chiral synchronization leading to a homochiral twisted nematic. A simple theory demonstrates that even without chiral synchronization, the presence of shape-persistent configurational fluctuations along with length-dispersity can be harnessed to generate non-zero chirality at moderate polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</description>

      <title>A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to the introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and thermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Probability distributions for kinetic roughening in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth with long-range temporal and spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08483v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the effects of long-range temporal and spatial correlations based on the rescaled distributions of the squared interface width $W^2(L,t)$ and the interface height $h(x,t)$ in the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth system within the early growth regimes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that long-range temporally correlated noise could not significantly impact the distribution form of the interface width. Generally, $W^2(L,t)$ obeys approximately lognormal distribution when the temporal correlation exponent $\theta \ge 0$. On the other hand, the effects of long-range spatially correlated noise are evidently different from the temporally correlated case. Our results show that, when the spatial correlation exponent $\rho \le 0.20$, the distribution forms of $W^2(L,t)$ approach the lognormal distribution, and when $\rho &gt; 0.20$, the distribution becomes more asymmetric, steep, and fat-tailed, and tends to an unknown distribution form. As a comparison, probability distributions of the interface height are also provided in the temporally and spatially correlated KPZ system, exhibiting quite different characteristics from each other within the whole correlated regimes. For the temporal correlation, the height distributions satisfy Tracy-Widom Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE) when $\theta \to 0$, and with increasing $\theta$, the height distributions crossover continously to an unknown distribution. However, for the spatial correlation, the height distributions gradually transition from the TW-GOE distribution to the standard Gaussian form.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin-Planck principle for simple and compound systems without using the Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</description>

      <title>Field-theory approach to flat polymerized membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</description>

      <title>Partial versus total resetting for L\'evy flights in d dimensions: similarities and discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes (L\'evy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for L\'evy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Spectral chaos bounds from scaling theory of maximally efficient quantum-dynamical scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key conjecture about the evolution of complex quantum systems towards an ergodic steady state, known as scrambling, is that this process acquires universal features when it is most efficient. We develop a single-parameter scaling theory for the spectral statistics in this scenario, which embodies exact self-similarity of the spectral correlations along the complete scrambling dynamics. We establish that the scaling predictions are matched by a privileged stochastic process and serve as bounds for other dynamical scrambling scenarios, allowing one to quantify inefficient or incomplete scrambling on all time scales.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Floquet thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for stabilizer Renyi entropy in spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and (Non)-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the quench spectroscopy method to dissipative and isolated non-Hermitian quantum lattice models via the case study of the open Bose-Hubbard chain and the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain respectively. We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the equation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>
