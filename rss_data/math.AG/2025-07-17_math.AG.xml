      <title>Dream resolution and principalization II: excellent schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a project on dream (or memoryless) principalization and resolution methods. It extends this theory from the case of schemes with enough derivations, which was established in [Tem25], to general excellent schemes of characteristic zero. So, similarly to McQuillan's approach developed in [McQ20], the approach of [ATW24] is now extended to the generality of all excellent schemes of characteristic zero. In addition, we precisely describe the set of invariants of canonical centers and establish the resolution in the non-embedded form, where one applies simple (stack-theoretical) modifications along subschemes of a special form that we call tubes. In the regular case these are precisely the subschemes corresponding to canonical centers.</description>

      <title>Depth one part of Tannakian groups of filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration.
  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</description>

      <title>Waldschmidt constants of symmetric sets of points in $\mathbb{P}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurations of points defined by complex reflection groups have attracted a lot of attention recently in several directions of research, e.g., the containment problem between ordinary and symbolic powers of ideals, in the theory of unexpected hypersurfaces, in the study of sets of points whose general projections are complete intersections and in the ideas revolving around the Bounded Negativity Conjecture. In order to understand these configurations better several attempts have been undertaken to compute their various invariants. In this paper we focus on their Waldschmidt constants. In the case of plane configurations of points determined by reflection groups most (but not all) Waldschmidt constants are known. Here we pass to configurations in $\mathbb{P}^3$ where new ideas are required as the identification between divisors and curves is no longer available. In particular, we precisely compute the Waldschmidt constant for configurations of points in $\mathbb{P}^3$ coming from the $D_4,B_4,F_4$, and $H_4$ root systems.</description>

      <title>An introduction to real oriented blowups in toric, toroidal and logarithmic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text is an introduction to the applications of rounding of complex log spaces (also known as Kato-Nakayama or Betti realization) to singularity theory. Log spaces in the sense of Fontaine and Illusie were first described in print by Kato, in a 1988 paper. Rounding of complex log spaces was introduced in a 1999 paper by Kato and Nakayama and is a functorial generalization of A'Campo's 1975 notion of a real oriented blowup. It allows to cut canonically any complex toroidal variety $X$ along its toroidal boundary $\partial X$, producing a topological manifold-with-boundary, whose boundary is a canonical representative of the boundary of any tubular neighborhood of $\partial X$ in $X$. In singularity theory, roundings may be used to get canonical representatives of links of isolated complex analytic singularities and of Milnor fibers of smoothings of complex singularities, once toroidal resolutions of the singularity or of the smoothing are chosen. The text starts with introductions to not necessarily normal toric varieties, it passes then to toroidal varieties and to their real oriented blowups. It continues with introductions to log spaces and to rounding of complex log spaces. It concludes with an important theorem of Nakayama and Ogus about the local triviality of the rounding of special types of log morphisms. The notions of affine toric variety, real oriented blowup, log structure and rounding are introduced by means of the classical passage to polar coordinates.</description>

      <title>Spectral Rigidity and Algebraicity: A Unified Framework for the Hodge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel symbolic analytic framework to address the Hodge Conjecture, utilizing a refined invariant called the Hermitian spectral fingerprint. We modify the fingerprint functional to specifically exclude $(k,k)$ components, demonstrating its vanishing for rational classes of type $(k,k)$. Critically, we develop a comprehensive proof strategy to establish the converse: the vanishing of this refined fingerprint across all realization functors (de Rham and $\ell$adic) implies the class is absolute Hodge. By fundamental theorems in arithmetic algebraic geometry, absolute Hodge classes of type $(k,k)$ are equivalent to algebraic cycles. This framework offers a new, robust criterion for detecting algebraic cycles, reformulating the conjecture into a problem of establishing the exhaustive spanning properties of GaussManin derivatives and Galois actions within their respective cohomology spaces. While building upon established deep results, this approach provides a fresh perspective and a pathway towards a complete resolution.</description>

      <title>A story of webs: the webs by conics on del Pezzo quartic surfaces and Gelfand-MacPherson's web of the spinor tenfold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we studied the web by conics $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{\rm dP}_4}$ on a del Pezzo quartic surface ${\rm dP}_4$ and proved that it enjoys suitable versions of most of the remarkable properties satisfied by Bol's web $\boldsymbol{\mathcal B}$. In particular, Bol's web can be seen as the toric quotient of the Gelfand-MacPherson web naturally defined on the $A_4$-grassmannian variety $G_2(\mathbf C^5)$ and we have shown that $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{\rm dP}_4}$ can be obtained in a similar way from the web $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}^{GM}_{ \hspace{-0.05cm} \boldsymbol{\mathcal Y}_5}$ which is the quotient by the Cartan torus of ${\rm Spin}_{10}(\mathbf C)$, of the Gelfand-MacPherson 10-web naturally defined on the tenfold spinor variety $\mathbb S_5$, a peculiar projective homogenous variety of type $D_5$.
  In the present paper, by means of direct and explicit computations, we show that many of the remarkable similarities between $\boldsymbol{\mathcal B}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{\rm dP}_4}$ actually can be extended to, or from an opposite perspective, can be seen as coming from some similarities between Bol's web and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}^{GM}_{ \hspace{-0.05cm} \boldsymbol{\mathcal Y}_5}$. The latter web can be seen as a natural uniquely defined rank 5 generalization of Bol's web. In particular, it carries a peculiar 2-abelian relation, denoted by ${\bf HLOG}_{ \boldsymbol{\mathcal Y}_5}$, which appears as a natural generalization of Abel's five terms relation of the dilogarithm and from which one can recover the weight 3 hyperlogarithmic functional identity of any quartic del Pezzo surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a reduced divisor in $\mathbb P^n_k$ for an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic $p &gt; 0$. We prove that if $(\mathbb P^n_k, D)$ is Frobenius liftable modulo $p^2$, then $D$ is a toric divisor. As a corollary, we show that if there exists a finite surjective morphism $f\colon Y\to X$ onto a smooth projective complex variety $X$ of Picard rank $1$ such that $(Y, f^{-1}(D)_{\mathrm{red}})$ is a toric pair, then $X$ is the projective space and $D$ is a toric divisor.</description>

      <title>On the cohomological representations of finite automorphism groups of singular curves and compact complex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group acting tamely on a proper reduced curve C over an algebraically closed field. We study the G-module structure on the cohomology groups of a G-equivariant locally free sheaf F on C, and give formulas of Chevalley--Weil type, with values in the Grothendieck ring R_k(G)_Q of finitely generated G-modules. We also give a similar formula for the singular cohomology of compact complex spaces.
  The focus is on the case where C is nodal. Using the Chevalley--Weil formula, we compute the G-invariant part of the global sections of the pluricanonical bundle \omega_C^{\otimes m}. In turn, we use the formula for m=2 to compute the equivariant deformation space of a stable G-curve C. We also obtain numerical criteria for the presence of any given irreducible representation in space of the global sections of \omega_C\otimes F, where F is an ample locally free G-sheaf on C. Some new phenomena, pathological compared to the smooth curve case, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using a ``quantum-to-classical" reduction formula on the Gromov-Witten invariants of flag vaireities $F\ell_n$, we provide a new proof of the Seidel operator on the quantum cohomology ring $QH^*(F\ell_n)$. Further, we reprove a quantum Pieri rule with respect to certain special Schubert class for $QH^*(F\ell_n)$. Finally, we propose a concrete conjecture on the corresponding quantum Pieri rule for the quantum $K$-theory of $F\ell_n$.</description>

Abstract: The F-conjecture gives a conjectural description of the ample cone of the Deligne-Mumford moduli space $\overline{M}_{g,n}$. We prove that the $S_n$-symmetric and the non-symmetric F-conjectures are equivalent. We also prove the Strong F-conjecture for $\overline{M}_{0,8}$ (and give an alternative proof for $\overline{M}_{0,7})$. Finally, we derive, as a consequence, the F-conjecture for the moduli space of stable curves $\overline{M}_{g}$ up to genus $g\leq 44$.</description>

Abstract: In this talk I give an introduction and present some recent progress towards understanding the cohomology rings of character varieties of Riemann surfaces, such as the proof of the $P=W$ conjecture and the computation of the zero-dimensional COHA. In the case of punctured sphere I present an explicit description relating the cohomology rings to the Hilbert scheme of $\mathbb{C}^2$, refining conjectures of Hausel-Letellier-Rodriguez-Villegas and Chuang-Diaconescu-Donagi-Pantev. I explain how the general case should be related to the symplectic geometry of the Hilbert scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Brun's theorem relating the relative algebraic $K$-theory and the relative cyclic homology, we compute certain relative algebraic $K$-groups of a $p$-adic smooth scheme over $W_n(k)$, where $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$. Inspired by this result and the work of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz, we define the infinitesimal motivic complexes, and then show a relative Chern character isomorphism with integral coefficients in a range. This has a direct consequence on infinitesimal deformations in algebraic $K$-theory, which is related to the $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Borisov-Joyce constructed a real virtual cycle on compact moduli spaces of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds, using derived differential geometry.
  We construct an algebraic virtual cycle. A key step is a localisation of Edidin-Graham's square root Euler class for $SO(r,\mathbb C)$ bundles to the zero locus of an isotropic section, or to the support of an isotropic cone.
  We prove a torus localisation formula, making the invariants computable and extending them to the noncompact case when the fixed locus is compact.
  We give a $K$-theoretic refinement by defining $K$-theoretic square root Euler classes and their localised versions.
  In a sequel we prove our invariants reproduce those of Borisov-Joyce.</description>

      <title>Henselian schemes in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair: a ring A and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of polynomials over A/I to factorizations over A. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry.
  In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove that all smooth Fano threefolds with Picard rank 2 and degree 28 are K-polystable, except for some explicit cases which we describe. We also give a classification of the normal bundle of a rational normal quartic curve in a smooth quadric threefold.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture on Hodge loci of linear combinations of linear subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $k \geq 5$ we give a counterexample to a conjecture of Movasati on the dimension of certain Hodge loci of cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{P}^{2k+1}$ containing two $k$-planes intersecting in dimension $k-3$. We give similar examples for Hodge loci of cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{P}^{2k+1}$ containing two $k$-planes intersecting in dimension $k-2$ and for quartic hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{P}^{2k+1}$ containing two $k$-planes intersecting in dimension $k-2$.
  Moreover, we present new evidence for Movasati's conjecture for the values of $k$ for which our type of counterexamples cannot exist, i.e., for $k=3,4$.</description>

      <title>Listing superspecial curves of genus three using Richelot isogeny graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In algebraic geometry, superspecial curves are important research objects. While the number of superspecial genus-3 curves in characteristic $p$ is known, the number of hyperelliptic ones among them has not been determined even for small $p$. In this paper, in order to compute the latter number, we give an explicit algorithm for computing the Richelot isogeny graph of superspecial principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension 3 using theta functions. In particular, one can determine whether a given vertex in the graph corresponds to the Jacobian of a genus-3 curve or not, and restore the defining equation of such a genus-3 curve from its theta constants. Our algorithm enables efficient enumeration of superspecial genus-3 curves, as all operations can be performed in $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. By implementing the algorithm in Magma, we successfully counted the number of hyperelliptic curves among them for all primes $11 \leq p &lt; 100$.</description>

      <title>Terminalizations of quotients of compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds by induced symplectic automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terminalizations of symplectic quotients are sources of new deformation types of irreducible symplectic varieties. We classify all terminalizations of quotients of Hilbert schemes of K3 surfaces or of generalized Kummer varieties, by finite groups of symplectic automorphisms induced from the underlying K3 or abelian surface. We determine their second Betti number and the fundamental group of their regular locus. In the Kummer case, we prove that the terminalizations have quotient singularities, and determine the singularities of their universal quasi-\'etale cover. In particular, we obtain at least nine new deformation types of irreducible symplectic varieties of dimension four. Finally, we compare our deformation types with those in [FM21; Men22]. The smooth terminalizations are only three and of K$3^{[n]}$-type, and surprisingly they all appeared in different places in the literature [Fuj83; Kaw09; Flo22].</description>

      <title>Geometric invariant theory for graded additive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider geometric invariant theory for \emph{graded additive groups}, groups of the form $\mathbb{G}_a^r\rtimes_w\mathbb{G}_m$ such that the $\mathbb{G}_m$-action on $\mathbb{G}_a^r$ is a scalar multiplication with weight $w\in\mathbb{N}_+$. We provide an algorithm of equivariant birational modifications, such that we can apply the geometric invariant theory of B\'erczi-Doran-Hawes-Kirwan. In particular, the geometric $\mathbb{G}_a^r$-quotient exists. This complements B\'erczi-Doran-Hawes-Kirwan, in the special case of one grading weight.</description>

      <title>A categorical flop in dimension one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we observe that the categorical structure of a flop occurs for some well-known non-commutative resolutions of a nodal curve. We describe the flop-flop spherical twists, and give a geometric interpretation in terms of Landau--Ginzburg models. The resolutions are all weakly crepant but not strongly crepant, and we formulate an intermediate condition that distinguishes the smaller ones.</description>

      <title>The supersingular locus of the Shimura variety of $\mathrm{GU}(2,n-2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the supersingular locus of a reduction at an inert prime of the Shimura variety attached to $\mathrm{GU}(2,n-2)$. More concretely, we realize irreducible components of the supersingular locus as closed subschemes of flag schemes over Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined by explicit conditions after taking perfections. Moreover we study the intersections of the irreducible components. Stratifications of Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using powers of Frobenius action appear in the description of the intersections.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity of zero-divisors, units and idempotents in a graded ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove several important results on graded rings, especially monoid-rings, that are motivated and inspired by Kaplansky's zero-divisor, unit and idempotents conjectures. Among the main results, we first generalize Kaplansky's zero-divisor conjecture of group-rings $K[G]$ (with $K$ a field) to the more general setting of $G$-graded rings $R=\bigoplus\limits_{n\in G}R_{n}$ with $G$ a torsion-free group. Then we prove that ...</description>
