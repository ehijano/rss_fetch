      <title>Open RAN Slicing with Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAN slicing technology is a key aspect of the Open RAN paradigm, allowing simultaneous and independent provision of various services such as ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) through virtual networks that share a single radio access infrastructure. Efficient resource allocation is crucial for RAN slicing, as each service has specific quality of service (QoS) requirements, and a balance between different services must be maintained. Although heuristic and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been explored to achieve efficient resource allocation, these approaches face notable limitations: heuristic algorithms face complexity issues that limit their effectiveness in large networks, RL solutions are constrained by their dependency on training data and struggle to adapt to new scenarios and environments. This paper proposes a framework that leverages quantum optimization techniques to optimize radio resource blocks allocation in Open RAN slicing for URLLC and eMBB services. We provide a classical problem formulation and the quantum implementation using the constrained quadratic model on Dwave quantum annealing platform, showcasing the potential of quantum optimization techniques to deliver in real-time optimal solutions for optimization problems in 5G and beyond networks.</description>

      <title>Digital-Twin assisted Network Energy Optimization during Low Traffic Hours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless network technology advances towards the sixth generation (6G), increasing network energy consumption has become a critical concern due to the growing demand for diverse services, radio deployments at various frequencies, larger bandwidths, and more antennas. Network operators must manage energy usage not only to reduce operational cost and improve revenue but also to minimize environmental impact by reducing the carbon footprint. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced several network energy savings (NES) features. However, the implementation details and system-level aspects of these features have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we explore system-level resource optimization for network energy savings in low-traffic scenarios. We introduce multiple NES optimization formulations and strategies, and further analyze their performance using a detailed network digital twin. Our results demonstrate promising NES gains of up to 44%. Additionally, we provide practical considerations for implementing the proposed schemes and examine their impacts on user equipment (UE) operation.</description>

      <title>A2P: A Scalable OFDMA Polling Algorithm for Time-Sensitive Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, advancements such as increased bandwidth, new modulation and coding schemes, frame aggregation, and the use of multiple antennas have been employed to enhance Wi-Fi performance. Nonetheless, as network density and the demand for low-latency applications increases, contention delays and retransmissions have become obstacles to efficient Wi-Fi deployment in modern scenarios. The introduction of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in the IEEE 802.11 standard allows simultaneous transmissions to and from multiple users within the same transmission opportunity, thereby reducing the contention. However, the AP must efficiently manage the resource allocation, particularly in uplink scenarios where it lacks prior knowledge of users' buffer statuses, thus making polling a critical bottleneck in networks with a high number of users with sporadic traffic pattern. This paper addresses the polling problem and introduces the A2P algorithm, designed to enable scalable and efficient polling in high-density OFDMA-based time sensitive Wi-Fi networks. Simulation results show that A2P outperforms the alternative schemes by maintaining significantly lower delay and packet loss in dense time-sensitive teleconferencing scenario.</description>

      <title>Towards an Efficient Combination of Adaptive Routing and Queuing Schemes in Fat-Tree Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interconnection network is a key element in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Datacenter (DC) systems whose performance depends on several design parameters, such as the topology, the switch architecture, and the routing algorithm. Among the most common topologies in HPC systems, the Fat-Tree offers several shortest-path routes between any pair of end-nodes, which allows multi-path routing schemes to balance traffic flows among the available links, thus reducing congestion probability. However, traffic balance cannot solve by itself some congestion situations that may still degrade network performance. Another approach to reduce congestion is queue-based flow separation, but our previous work shows that multi-path routing may spread congested flows across several queues, thus being counterproductive. In this paper, we propose a set of restrictions to improve alternative routes selection for multi-path routing algorithms in Fat-Tree networks, so that they can be positively combined with queuing schemes.</description>

      <title>Hades: Hierarchical Adaptable Decoding for Efficient and Elastic vRAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cellular networks, virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) enable replacing traditional specialized hardware at cell sites with software running on commodity servers distributed across edge and remote clouds. However, some vRAN functions (e.g., forward error correction (FEC) decoding) require excessive edge compute resources due to their intensive computational demands and inefficiencies caused by workload fluctuations. This high demand for computational power significantly drives up the costs associated with edge computing, posing a major challenge for deploying 5G/6G vRAN solutions. To address this challenge, we propose Hades, a hierarchical architecture for vRAN that enables the distribution of uplink FEC decoding processing across edge and remote clouds. Hades refactors the vRAN stack and introduces mechanisms that allow controlling and managing the workload over these hierarchical cloud resources. More specifically, Hades splits the traditional non-stop run-to-completion iterative FEC decoding process into latency-critical early decoding iterations, i.e., related to MAC processing and early pre-parsing for content identification, and completion decoding iterations, i.e., decoding tasks with larger decoding delay budgets for final data bits extraction. This partitioning provides Hades the flexibility to utilize the available midhaul (MH) network for offloading the latency tolerant part of decoding to remote cloud instances, while performing time-sensitive decoding at the edge cloud locations for low-delay processing. Hades controls decoding load distribution between the edge and remote clouds, based on the edge decoding capacity and the offload network bandwidth, thus improving the utilization of edge compute.</description>

      <title>Congestion Management in High-Performance Interconnection Networks Using Adaptive Routing Notifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interconnection network is a crucial subsystem in High-Performance Computing clusters and Data-centers, guaranteeing high bandwidth and low latency to the applications' communication operations. Unfortunately, congestion situations may spoil network performance unless the network design applies specific countermeasures. Adaptive routing algorithms are a traditional approach to dealing with congestion since they provide traffic flows with alternative routes that bypass congested areas. However, adaptive routing decisions at switches are typically based on local information without a global network traffic perspective, leading to congestion spreading throughout the network beyond the original congested areas. In this paper, we propose a new efficient congestion management strategy that leverages adaptive routing notifications currently available in some interconnect technologies and efficiently isolates the congesting flows in reserved spaces at switch buffers. The experiment results based on simulations of realistic traffic scenarios show that our proposal removes the congestion impact.</description>

      <title>REAL: Reinforcement Learning-Enabled xApps for Experimental Closed-Loop Optimization in O-RAN with OSC RIC and srsRAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) offers an open, programmable architecture for next-generation wireless networks, enabling advanced control through AI-based applications on the near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC). However, fully integrated, real-time demonstrations of closed-loop optimization in O-RAN remain scarce. In this paper, we present a complete framework that combines the O-RAN Software Community RIC (OSC RIC) with srsRAN for near-real-time network slicing using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our system orchestrates resources across diverse slice types (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) for up to 12 UEs. We incorporate GNU Radio blocks for channel modeling, including Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL), single-tap multipath, AWGN, and Doppler effects, to emulate an urban mobility scenario. Experimental results show that our RL-based xApps dynamically adapt resource allocation and maintain QoS under varying traffic demands, highlighting both the feasibility and challenges of end-to-end AI-driven optimization in a lightweight O-RAN testbed. Our findings establish a baseline for real-time RL-based slicing in a disaggregated 5G framework and underscore the need for further enhancements to support fully simulated PHY digital twins without reliance on commercial software.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technology demands real-time data transmission to deliver an immersive and interactive user experience. This study investigates the implementation of UDP Ethernet communication in VR systems, focusing on its impact on network performance. Experiments were conducted to analyze how factors such as cable length, data rate, and packet processing rate (PPR) influence system performance. A series of tests were performed, and the results were visualized through detailed graphs. The findings reveal how variations in these parameters affect communication speed and stability, providing insights for optimizing VR system design. By leveraging the high-speed, low-overhead advantages of UDP Ethernet, this study may contribute understanding of network performance in VR applications, offering practical guidance for developers and engineers in creating responsive and efficient VR environments.</description>

      <title>Simulating Application Behavior for Network Monitoring and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing network simulations often rely on simplistic models that send packets at random intervals, failing to capture the critical role of application-level behaviour. This paper presents a statistical approach that extracts and models application behaviour using probability density functions to generate realistic network simulations. By convolving learned application patterns, the framework produces dynamic, scalable traffic representations that closely mimic real-world networks. The method enables rigorous testing of network monitoring tools and anomaly detection systems by dynamically adjusting application behaviour. It is lightweight, capable of running multiple emulated applications on a single machine, and scalable for analysing large networks where real data collection is impractical. To encourage adoption and further testing, the full code is provided as open-source, allowing researchers and practitioners to replicate and extend the framework for diverse network environments.</description>

      <title>SigN: SIMBox Activity Detection Through Latency Anomalies at the Cellular Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their widespread adoption, cellular networks face growing vulnerabilities due to their inherent complexity and the integration of advanced technologies. One of the major threats in this landscape is Voice over IP (VoIP) to GSM gateways, known as SIMBox devices. These devices use multiple SIM cards to route VoIP traffic through cellular networks, enabling international bypass fraud with losses of up to $3.11 billion annually. Beyond financial impact, SIMBox activity degrades network performance, threatens national security, and facilitates eavesdropping on communications. Existing detection methods for SIMBox activity are hindered by evolving fraud techniques and implementation complexities, limiting their practical adoption in operator networks.This paper addresses the limitations of current detection methods by introducing SigN , a novel approach to identifying SIMBox activity at the cellular edge. The proposed method focuses on detecting remote SIM card association, a technique used by SIMBox appliances to mimic human mobility patterns. The method detects latency anomalies between SIMBox and standard devices by analyzing cellular signaling during network attachment. Extensive indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that SIMBox devices generate significantly higher attachment latencies, particularly during the authentication phase, where latency is up to 23 times greater than that of standard devices. We attribute part of this overhead to immutable factors such as LTE authentication standards and Internet-based communication protocols. Therefore, our approach offers a robust, scalable, and practical solution to mitigate SIMBox activity risks at the network edge.</description>

      <title>Leveraging InfiniBand Controller to Configure Deadlock-Free Routing Engines for Dragonflies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dragonfly topology is currently one of the most popular network topologies in high-performance parallel systems. The interconnection networks of many of these systems are built from components based on the InfiniBand specification. However, due to some constraints in this specification, the available versions of the InfiniBand network controller (OpenSM) do not include routing engines based on some popular deadlock-free routing algorithms proposed theoretically for Dragonflies, such as the one proposed by Kim and Dally based on Virtual-Channel shifting. In this paper we propose a straightforward method to integrate this routing algorithm in OpenSM as a routing engine, explaining in detail the configuration required to support it. We also provide experiment results, obtained both from a real InfiniBand-based cluster and from simulation, to validate the new routing engine and to compare its performance and requirements against other routing engines currently available in OpenSM.</description>

      <title>MPTCP in Single Radio Access Networks: a Paradox or an Opportunity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the use of MultiPath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) in a single Radio Access Technology (RAT) network. Different from other studies where multiple network access technologies are explored by the MPTCP, in this work we assess and evaluate the capability of MPTCP to operate over a single radio access network environment. With a vehicular network as use case, we show how the IEEE 802.11p interface is shared among the multiple logical links created between the On-Board Unit (OBU) and the several Road Side Units (RSUs) in its range, supporting the different MPTCP subflows. The results, obtained through experimentation with real vehicular networking hardware, show that MPTCP allows for seamless handovers, ensuring continuous, stable and efficient communication in highly mobile environments.</description>

      <title>BYON: Bring Your Own Networks for Digital Agriculture Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital agriculture technologies rely on sensors, drones, robots, and autonomous farm equipment to improve farm yields and incorporate sustainability practices. However, the adoption of such technologies is severely limited by the lack of broadband connectivity in rural areas. We argue that farming applications do not require permanent always-on connectivity. Instead, farming activity and digital agriculture applications follow seasonal rhythms of agriculture. Therefore, the need for connectivity is highly localized in time and space. We introduce BYON, a new connectivity model for high bandwidth agricultural applications that relies on emerging connectivity solutions like citizens broadband radio service (CBRS) and satellite networks. BYON creates an agile connectivity solution that can be moved along a farm to create spatio-temporal connectivity bubbles. BYON incorporates a new gateway design that reacts to the presence of crops and optimizes coverage in agricultural settings. We evaluate BYON in a production farm and demonstrate its benefits.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Optimized VANET Protocols in Real World Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide the communications required to deploy Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In the current state of the art in this field there is a lack of studies on real outdoor experiments to validate thenew VANETs protocols and applications proposed by designers. In this work we have addressed the definition of a testbed in order to study the performance of the Vehicular Data Transfer Protocol (VDTP) in a real urban VANET. The VDTP protocol has been tested by employing six different parameter settings: one defined by human experts and five automatically optimized by means of metaheuristic algorithms (PSO, DE, GA, ES, and SA). As a result, we have been able to confirm the performance improvements when optimized VDTP configurations are used, validating the results previously obtained through simulation.</description>

      <title>FORTE: An Open-Source System for Cost-Effective and Scalable Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forests are an essential part of our biosphere, regulating climate, acting as a sink for greenhouse gases, and providing numerous other ecosystem services. However, they are negatively impacted by climatic stressors such as drought or heat waves. In this paper, we introduce FORTE, an open-source system for environmental monitoring with the aim of understanding how forests react to such stressors. It consists of two key components: (1) a wireless sensor network (WSN) deployed in the forest for data collection, and (2) a Data Infrastructure for data processing, storage, and visualization. The WSN contains a Central Unit capable of transmitting data to the Data Infrastructure via LTE-M and several spatially independent Satellites that collect data over large areas and transmit them wirelessly to the Central Unit. Our prototype deployments show that our solution is cost-effective compared to commercial solutions, energy-efficient with sensor nodes lasting for several months on a single charge, and reliable in terms of data quality. FORTE's flexible architecture makes it suitable for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications beyond forest monitoring. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we describe the high-level requirements necessary for developing an environmental monitoring system. Second, we present an architecture and prototype implementation of the requirements by introducing our FORTE platform and demonstrating its effectiveness through multiple field tests. Lastly, we provide source code, documentation, and hardware design artifacts as part of our open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Simplifying Network Traffic Classification Leveraging RFCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of encryption has significantly enhanced privacy and security while posing challenges for network traffic classification. Recent approaches address these challenges by transforming network traffic into text or image formats to leverage deep-learning models originally designed for natural language processing, and computer vision. However, these transformations often contradict network protocol specifications, introduce noisy features, and result in resource-intensive processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose NetMatrix, a minimalistic tabular representation of network traffic that eliminates noisy attributes and focuses on meaningful features leveraging RFCs (Request for Comments) definitions. By combining NetMatrix with a vanilla XGBoost classifier, we implement a lightweight approach, LiM ("Less is More") that achieves classification performance on par with state-of-the-art methods such as ET-BERT and YaTC. Compared to selected baselines, experimental evaluations demonstrate that LiM improves resource consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, this study underscores the effectiveness of simplicity in traffic representation and machine learning model selection, paving the way towards resource-efficient network traffic classification.</description>

      <title>Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</description>

      <title>CardioLive: Empowering Video Streaming with Online Cardiac Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</description>

      <title>Dismountability in Temporal Cliques Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are available only at certain points in time. It is temporally connected if the nodes can reach each other by paths that traverse the edges chronologically (temporal paths). In general, temporal graphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity (temporal spanners). In the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size $O(n\log n)$ are guaranteed. The original proof by Casteigts et al. [ICALP 2019] combines a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In a recent work, Angrick et al. [ESA 2024] simplified the proof and showed, among other things, that a one-sided version of dismountability can be used to replace the second part of the proof.
  In this paper, we revisit the dismountability principle. We characterizing the structure that a temporal clique has if it is not 1-hop dismountable, then not {1,2}-hop dismountable, and finally not {1,2,3}-hop dismountable.
  It turns out that if a clique is k-hop dismountable for any other k, then it must also be {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. Interestingly, excluding only 1-hop and 2-hop dismountability is already sufficient for reducing the spanner problem from cliques to bi-cliques. Put together with the strategy of Angrick et al., the entire $O(n \log n)$ result can now be recovered using only dismountability. An interesting by-product of our analysis is that any minimal counter-example to the existence of $4n$ spanners must satisfy the properties of non {1,2,3}-hop dismountable cliques.
  In the second part, we discuss connections between dismountability and pivotability. We show that recursively k-hop dismountable cliques are pivotable (and thus admits $2n$ spanners, whatever k). We define a family of labelings (called full-range) which force both dismountability and pivotability and that gives some evidence that large lifetimes could be exploited more generally.</description>

      <title>ForestColl: Throughput-Optimal Collective Communications on Heterogeneous Network Fabrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern DNN models grow ever larger, collective communications between the accelerators (allreduce, etc.) emerge as a significant performance bottleneck. Designing efficient communication schedules is challenging, given today's heterogeneous and diverse network fabrics. We present ForestColl, a tool that generates throughput-optimal schedules for any network topology. ForestColl constructs broadcast/aggregation spanning trees as the communication schedule, achieving theoretical optimality. Its schedule generation runs in strongly polynomial time and is highly scalable. ForestColl supports any network fabrics, including both switching fabrics and direct accelerator connections. We evaluated ForestColl on multi-box AMD MI250 and NVIDIA DGX A100 platforms. ForestColl showed significant improvements over the vendors' own optimized communication libraries, RCCL and NCCL, across various settings and in LLM training. ForestColl also outperformed other state-of-the-art schedule generation techniques with both more efficient generated schedules and substantially faster schedule generation speed.</description>

Abstract: The traditional industrial communication networks may not meet the requirements of the main smart factory applications together, such as Remote control and safety applications (which considered as strict real time applications) and augmented reality (which consumes wide bandwidth). This work suggests an enhanced communication network to serve an optimum case for the smart factory includes heavy data applications and real-time applications in one hand using the concepts of time sensitive networks (TSN) to address the limitation of real-time applications and the edge computing to assimilate the heavy data applications. The current work submits an experimental scenario to exploit H.265 compression method based on edge computing concept to mitigate consuming the capacity on overall network performance for augmented reality application. The results of enhanced communication network indicated that the latency of real time applications was less than 1msec while the packet data delivery of rest applications was 99.999%.</description>

      <title>Learning and Reconstructing Conflicts in O-RAN: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Component Analysis Towards Effective VNF Profiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing concerns of knowledge transfer and data privacy challenge the traditional gather-and-analyse paradigm in networks. Specifically, the intelligent orchestration of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) requires understanding and profiling the resource consumption. However, profiling all kinds of VNFs is time-consuming. It is important to consider transferring the well-profiled VNF knowledge to other lack-profiled VNF types while keeping data private. To this end, this paper proposes a Federated Transfer Component Analysis (FTCA) method between the source and target VNFs. FTCA first trains Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on the source VNF profiling data, and the trained GANs model is sent to the target VNF domain. Then, FTCA realizes federated domain adaptation by using the generated source VNF data and less target VNF profiling data, while keeping the raw data locally. Experiments show that the proposed FTCA can effectively predict the required resources for the target VNF. Specifically, the RMSE index of the regression model decreases by 38.5% and the R-squared metric advances up to 68.6%.</description>

      <title>Robustifying ML-powered Network Classifiers with PANTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple network management tasks, from resource allocation to intrusion detection, rely on some form of ML-based network traffic classification (MNC). Despite their potential, MNCs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which can lead to outages, poor decision-making, and security violations, among other issues. The goal of this paper is to help network operators assess and enhance the robustness of their MNC against adversarial inputs. The most critical step for this is generating inputs that can fool the MNC while being realizable under various threat models. Compared to other ML models, finding adversarial inputs against MNCs is more challenging due to the existence of non-differentiable components e.g., traffic engineering and the need to constrain inputs to preserve semantics and ensure reliability. These factors prevent the direct use of well-established gradient-based methods developed in adversarial ML (AML). To address these challenges, we introduce PANTS, a practical white-box framework that uniquely integrates AML techniques with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to generate adversarial inputs for MNCs. We also embed PANTS into an iterative adversarial training process that enhances the robustness of MNCs against adversarial inputs. PANTS is 70% and 2x more likely in median to find adversarial inputs against target MNCs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, namely Amoeba and BAP. PANTS improves the robustness of the target MNCs by 52.7% (even against attackers outside of what is considered during robustification) without sacrificing their accuracy.</description>
