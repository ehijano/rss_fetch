      <title>The Emergence of the Normal Distribution in Deterministic Chaotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem states that, in the limit of a large number of terms, an appropriately scaled sum of independent random variables yields another random variable whose probability distribution tends to a stable distribution. The condition of independence, however, only holds in real systems as an approximation. To extend the theorem to more general situations, previous studies have derived a version of the Central Limit Theorem that also holds for variables that are not independent. Here, we present numerical results that characterize how convergence is attained when the variables being summed are deterministically related to one another by the recurrent application of an ergodic mapping. In all the explored cases, the convergence to the limit distribution is slower than for random sampling. Yet, the speed at which convergence is attained varies substantially from system to system, and these variations imply differences in the way information about the deterministic nature of the dynamics is progressively lost as the number of summands increases. Some of the identified factors in shaping the convergence process are the strength of mixing induced by the mapping and the shape of the marginal distribution of each variable, most particularly, the presence of divergences or fat tails.</description>

      <title>Sparks in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for the definition of signal regions in searches for new physics at collider experiments, specifically those conducted at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. By leveraging multi-dimensional histograms with precise arithmetic and utilizing the SparkDensityTree library, it is possible to identify high-density regions within the available phase space, potentially improving sensitivity to very small signals. Inspired by an ongoing search for dark mesons at the ATLAS experiment, CMS open data is used for this proof-of-concept intentionally targeting an already excluded signal. Several signal regions are defined based on density estimates of signal and background. These preliminary regions align well with the physical properties of the signal while effectively rejecting background events. While not explored in this work, this method is also scalable, which makes it ideal for large datasets such as those expected at the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Finally, this method is flexible and can be easily extended, promising a boost to the signal region definition process for new physics searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Active Causal Learning for Decoding Chemical Complexities with Targeted Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and enhancing inherent properties based on molecular structures is paramount to design tasks in medicine, materials science, and environmental management. Most of the current machine learning and deep learning approaches have become standard for predictions, but they face challenges when applied across different datasets due to reliance on correlations between molecular representation and target properties. These approaches typically depend on large datasets to capture the diversity within the chemical space, facilitating a more accurate approximation, interpolation, or extrapolation of the chemical behavior of molecules. In our research, we introduce an active learning approach that discerns underlying cause-effect relationships through strategic sampling with the use of a graph loss function. This method identifies the smallest subset of the dataset capable of encoding the most information representative of a much larger chemical space. The identified causal relations are then leveraged to conduct systematic interventions, optimizing the design task within a chemical space that the models have not encountered previously. While our implementation focused on the QM9 quantum-chemical dataset for a specific design task-finding molecules with a large dipole moment-our active causal learning approach, driven by intelligent sampling and interventions, holds potential for broader applications in molecular, materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Degree-corrected distribution-free model for community detection in weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A degree-corrected distribution-free model is proposed for weighted social networks with latent structural information. The model extends the previous distribution-free models by considering variation in node degree to fit real-world weighted networks, and it also extends the classical degree-corrected stochastic block model from un-weighted network to weighted network. We design an algorithm based on the idea of spectral clustering to fit the model. Theoretical framework on consistent estimation for the algorithm is developed under the model. Theoretical results when edge weights are generated from different distributions are analyzed. We also propose a general modularity as an extension of Newman's modularity from un-weighted network to weighted network. Using experiments with simulated and real-world networks, we show that our method significantly outperforms the uncorrected one, and the general modularity is effective.</description>

      <title>Bipartite mixed membership distribution-free model. A novel model for community detection in overlapping bipartite weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling and estimating mixed memberships for overlapping unipartite un-weighted networks has been well studied in recent years. However, to our knowledge, there is no model for a more general case, the overlapping bipartite weighted networks. To close this gap, we introduce a novel model, the Bipartite Mixed Membership Distribution-Free (BiMMDF) model. Our model allows an adjacency matrix to follow any distribution as long as its expectation has a block structure related to node membership. In particular, BiMMDF can model overlapping bipartite signed networks and it is an extension of many previous models, including the popular mixed membership stochastic blcokmodels. An efficient algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of consistent estimation is applied to fit BiMMDF. We then obtain the separation conditions of BiMMDF for different distributions. Furthermore, we also consider missing edges for sparse networks. The advantage of BiMMDF is demonstrated in extensive synthetic networks and eight real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;~ 5% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, in particular, relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>
