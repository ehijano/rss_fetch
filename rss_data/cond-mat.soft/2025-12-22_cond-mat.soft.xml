      <title>Complexity in the medium-range order of gallium as a polyvalent liquid metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicity in chemical composition does not always translate into simplicity in the structures and dynamics of liquids and solids. Some elementary liquid metals, such as gallium, show unusual behaviors in thermodynamic and transport properties as a result of their complex atomic structure and dynamics. In this work, we study the real-space atomic correlation function of liquid gallium by neutron scattering. In the pair-distribution function, there exist two kinds of medium-range order (MRO), characterized by oscillations beyond the first nearest neighbors. On the other hand, the first neighbor shell shows only one kind of bond. The two types of MRO are strongly overlapping in space and fluctuating in time. We propose that they are the basis for anomalous behavior of liquid gallium. This view challenges the current view that liquid gallium consists of fluctuating metallic and insulating domains. These findings shed new light on the interpretation of similar microscopic anomalies observed in other semi-metallic liquids.</description>

      <title>Real-space Atomic Dynamics in Liquid Gallium Studied by Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium is a prototypical liquid metal and has gained renewed attention due to its unique properties. Characterizing and elucidating its atomic dynamics remains elusive despite numerous studies, primarily due to the challenges of quantifying atomic-scale dynamics in liquids. Recent developments in inelastic neutron scattering enable us to measure the Van Hove correlation function that describes the real-space motion of liquid atoms. In this work, we use this approach to reveal the dynamics in gallium liquids and find the co-existence of two dynamical medium-range orders (MROs), which have a dynamical behavior distinct from that of the short-range order (SRO). We propose that these MROs are driven by global forces in the form of two density waves, as a direct consequence of the underlying competition between ionic core repulsion and valence electron cohesion. We suggest that the density wave approach is not only applicable to other metallic liquids exhibiting similar structural anomalies, but also offers a promising direction for elucidating the dynamics of complex liquids and glasses by linking electronic-state fluctuations to atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Selective trapping of bacteria in porous media by cell length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria commonly inhabit porous environments such as host tissues, soil, and marine sediments, where complex geometries constrain and redirect their motion. Although bacterial motility has been studied in porous media, the roles of cell length and pore shape in navigating these environments remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how cell morphology and pore architecture jointly determine bacterial spreading behavior. Using genetically engineered E. coli with tunable cell length, we performed single-cell tracking in microfluidic devices that mimic ordered and disordered porous structures. We find that elongated bacteria traverse ordered pore networks more effectively than short cells, exhibiting straighter paths, greater directional persistence, and enhanced exploration efficiency. In contrast, in disordered porous media, elongated bacteria become trapped in dead-end regions for extended periods, resulting in markedly reduced navigational efficiency. Together, these results reveal how cell shape and environmental geometry interact to govern bacterial transport. Moreover, we suggest a new mechanism for separating antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria from elongated susceptible cells in designer porous media.</description>

      <title>Growth of Dynamic and Static Correlations in the Aging Dynamics of a Glass-Forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we have performed finite-size scaling (FSS) in the aging regime of a model glass-forming liquid to investigate how the length scales associated with amorphous order (static length) and dynamic heterogeneity (dynamic length) evolve with waiting time. The $\alpha$-relaxation time in the aging regime reveals non-monotonic finite-size effects with a peak at an intermediate system size, which, as far as we know, are not found in the equilibrium systems, and the peak position shifts to larger system sizes with decreasing temperature and increasing waiting time, indicating a growth of a characteristic length scale with waiting time. The extracted correlation volume associated with amorphous order increases logarithmically with the waiting time. Detailed analysis of the dependence of the length scale on waiting time allowed us to estimate the static length scale in the deep supercooled liquid regime. The dynamic length scale, obtained from FSS and block analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility, follows a power-law growth with waiting time. The values of the length scales obtained agree well with those obtained from different spatial correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Segregation dynamics in active-passive mixtures of semiflexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the segregation of motile semiflexible filaments from a background of similar but non-motile filaments. Our Langevin dynamics simulations reveal a wide range of emergent structures governed by filament flexibility and activity, i.e., self-propulsion strength. The system segregates at low activities, while at high activities it undergoes remixing which is a characteristic feature of semi-flexible active filaments. We show that collision-induced softening of single filaments is the dominant mode for this remixing. We provide a scaling argument for the lowering of the active polymer stiffness and show that it agrees well with the lowering of the segregation order parameter. We expect that our studies will shed light on the spatial organization of biofilaments within the cell, on the plasma-membrane, and beyond, and help in the design of novel biomaterials whose structure can be tuned via the properties of the active or the passive filaments.</description>

      <title>Reentrant melting of scarred odd crystals by self-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial confinement can induce geometrical frustration in condensed phases, giving rise to topological defects that confer materials with new and exotic properties. Here, we experimentally uncover the remarkable effect of confinement-induced defect strings termed `grain boundary scars' on the behavior of dense two-dimensional assemblies of granular spinners, a canonical odd elastic solid. We show that the spatial arrangement of these scars fundamentally reshapes the flows triggered by chiral activity. Specifically, they cause the topologically protected edge flows - a ubiquitous feature of confined spinner assemblies - to decouple from the bulk. Strikingly, increasing the net chiral activity of the system by tuning the ratio of counterclockwise to clockwise spinners caused spontaneous self-shearing. The resulting odd radial stresses led to a chiral activity-mediated reentrant melting transition at a fixed areal spinner density. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting geometrical frustration to elicit novel responses from odd elastic solids.</description>

      <title>Cooling mechanism controls motility-induced phase separation in inertial active liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a central collective phenomenon in active matter, theoretically established in the overdamped regime. We discover that the dynamical origin of MIPS is fundamentally altered by inertia, which induces a cooling mechanism absent in overdamped active matter. This conclusion is supported by an active variant of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and by a kinetic theory for inertial self-propelled hard spheres derived from the microscopic dynamics. In contrast to the overdamped case, both analyses demonstrate that inertial MIPS does not rely on volume exclusion but on a cooling mechanism involving density, polarization, and temperature fields. This mechanism emerges from the competition between activity and a density dependent collision rate, arising from spatial correlations between colliding particles. These findings open a pathway to fundamentally connect inertial active matter with granular physics.</description>

      <title>Collective Hard Core Interactions Leave Multiscale Signatures in Number Fluctuation Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A full understanding of transport in dense, interacting suspensions requires analysis frameworks sensitive to self and collective dynamics across all relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we introduce a trajectory-free approach to address this problem based on the power spectral density of particle number fluctuations (N-PSD). By combining colloidal experiments and theory we show that the N-PSD naturally probes behaviour across multiple important dynamic regimes and we fully uncover the mechanistic origins of characteristic spectral scalings and timescales. In particular, we demonstrate that while high-frequency scalings link to self-diffusion, low-frequency scalings sensitively capture long-lived correlations and collective dynamics. In this regime, interactions lead to non-trivial spectral signatures, governed by pairwise particle exchange at small length scales and collective rearrangements over large scales. Our findings thus provide important insight into the effect of interactions on microscopic dynamics and fluctuation phenomena and establish a powerful new tool with which to probe dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Internal Waves Control Bulk Flow in Silos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally measure paticle acceleration within the bulk during the discharge of a granular silo. We highlight the existence of a deceleration wave emerging at the outlet level near the dead zone and propagates toward the top of the medium. The wave emission frequency is extracted from spatiotemporal diagrams of the Eulerian instantaneous acceleration profiles. Surprisingly, we find that this frequency decreases with the cohesion of the medium and is independent of the outlet size.</description>

      <title>Condensation dynamics of sticky and anchored flexible biopolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells regulate gene expression in part by forming DNA-protein condensates in the nucleus. While existing theories describe the equilibrium size and stability of such condensates, their dynamics remain less understood. Here, we use coarse-grained 3D Brownian-dynamics simulations to study how long, end-anchored biopolymers condense over time due to transient crosslinking. By tracking how clusters nucleate, merge, and disappear, we identify two dominant dynamical pathways, ripening and merging, that govern the progression from an uncompacted chain to a single condensate. We show how microscopic kinetic parameters, protein density, and mechanical constraints shape these pathways. Using insights from the simulations, we construct a minimal mechanistic free-energy model that captures the observed scaling behavior. Together, these results clarify the dynamical determinants of DNA and chromatin reorganization on timescales relevant to gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Reversible Plasticity in an Amorphous Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local rearrangements are the elements of plastic deformation in an amorphous solid. In oscillatory shear, they can switch reversibly between two distinct configurations. While these repeating relaxations are typically considered in the limit of slow driving, their dynamics is less well understood. We perform experiments on a colloidal amorphous solid at an oil-water interface. The rearrangement timescales we observe span at least 1 decade, with no apparent upper bound. As frequency is increased, individual rearrangements appear faster and more hysteretic, but may disappear entirely above a crossover frequency -- suggesting that in practical experiments, the slowest rearrangements may be latent. We show how to find the effective potential energy that reproduces a particle's frequency-dependent motion. In rare cases, this potential energy has only one minimum. Our results have implications for the energy landscapes and rheology of amorphous or glassy solids, for sound propagation in nonlinear media, and for mechanical memory and history-dependence.</description>

      <title>Impact of Heater Thermal Properties on Nucleate Pool Boiling: Insights from a Multiscale Automata Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of heater material properties on nucleate pool boiling using a comprehensive simulation model. Copper and silicon oxide are selected as reference materials due to their properties as excellent and poor heat conductors, respectively. The model integrates well-known heat transfer mechanisms, allowing for the assessment of the effects of these distinct heater materials. The results show that materials with superior thermal diffusivity, such as copper, significantly enhance cooling efficiency during nucleate boiling. Moreover, the study provides insights into the relationship between bubble growth, microlayer recovery beneath a bubble, temperature fluctuations, and heater properties. Comparisons between copper and silicon oxide underscore variations in bubble frequency, attributed to differences in bubble growth time, microlayer recovery time, and material-dependent behavior. The influence of neighboring boiling sites is especially pronounced in silicon oxide due to its low thermal conductivity and diffusivity values. Temperature variations in this material become highly visible due to its very slow response to temperature changes. Simulation results align well with semi-empirical correlations, confirming the model's success in capturing the intricate phenomena of nucleate pool boiling. In summary, the model reveals that changes in the thermal properties of the heater affect not only boiling performance but also key characteristics of the process, including bubble frequency, boiling patterns, regularity, and cavity reactivation speed.</description>

      <title>Design of a minimal, allosteric, and ATPase-like machine using mechanical linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ATPases cyclically convert chemical energy in the form of ATP gradients into directed motion inside cells. To function, ATPases rely on allosteric communication between at least two binding sites, an internal signaling mechanism that is not well understood. Here, we model an ATPase-like machine by using a system of mechanical linkages to recreate negative allosteric coupling between two binding sites and generate cycles in which the sites alternate occupancy. The ATPase analog has two mechanical degrees of freedom and two discretized binding sites: one for the ATP, Pi and ADP analogs, and one for an allosteric effector analog. The geometry of the ATPase analog allows stepwise binding reactions at each site to capture the two degrees of freedom in a mutually exclusive way. Consequently, the enzyme interconverts between multiple rigid and partially rigid forms, such that neither site can be fully bound when both sites are occupied. Two mechanisms work together to generate an enzymatic cycle: one, in which the tighter-binding ATP analog can bind and displace the effector from the enzyme; and a second, in which flexibility introduced by splitting the ATP analog into two pieces (catalysis) allows the effector to rebind and displace the products (ADP analog). We show that cleavage (forward catalysis) and ligation (reverse catalysis) alter the rigidity of the enzyme complex equivalently to binding and dissociation, respectively, but must do so more slowly for effective cycling to take place. Simple designs for synthetic systems that mimic ATPase monomers can be derived from this work.</description>

      <title>Stability of (Active) Bilayer Skyrmions in Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions are nanoscale composite textures that exhibit high-speed, Hall-free current-driven motion and recently demonstrated self-propulsion. These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems.</description>

      <title>Microstructure of polydisperse colloidal gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use confocal microscopy to image colloidal gels formed from highly polydisperse particles. We suspend our polydisperse particles in a density matched solvent, and let the particles spontaneously aggregate through the van der Waals force. The particle size distribution $P(R)$ is roughly log-normal, with the largest particles more than 15 times the size of the smallest particles. The pairing of nearest neighbor particles is consistent with a null hypothesis that pairings are made randomly, that is, any two particle sizes have a probability of being neighbors consistent with their proportionality in $P(R)$. That being said, as expected, larger particles have more nearest neighbors than small ones. This leads to an over-representation of large particles in tetrahedral structures where four particles are mutually nearest neighbors, showing that large particles help provide rigidity to the gel structure. The tetrahedral structures also suggest that particles are able to rearrange during the gelation process, until their motion is stabilized by the multiple contacts with their neighbors. We discuss the implications of how other size distributions $P(R)$ would affect the gel structure.</description>

      <title>Frenkel's entropy-exchange mechanism in monodisperse, nearly hard-sphere colloids: minimal perturbations to access fluid-crystal coexistence</title>

Abstract: Entropically driven fluid-solid transitions in monodisperse, purely repulsive hard spheres (MPRHS) are well established in theory, simulation, and experiment for atomic and colloidal systems. For MPRHS, however, coexistence is usually located via bulk free-energy calculations; the underlying microscopic balance between configurational and vibrational entropy is left implicit. Frenkel clarified this mechanism explicitly as an exchange of long-range configurational entropy for short-range vibrational entropy, but in the pristine MPRHS limit the nucleation barrier near coexistence is so high that phase separation is predicted only on astronomical time scales. Consistent with this, even unbiased simulations do not show spontaneous, equilibrium fluid-crystal coexistence; transient mixtures are mostly overtaken by a single phase; observed coexistence is still algorithmically-driven. Nearly hard-sphere colloid experiments do observe fluid-crystal coexistence, but always in the presence of unavoidable triggers such as gravity, walls, and polydispersity. We treat the hard-sphere phase diagram as settled and ask how the entropic exchange mechanism can be revealed in nearly hard-sphere colloidal simulations. We probe the mechanism on finite time scales by introducing minimal perturbations that trigger phase separation: small reductions in hardness that increase locally accessible free volume (and thus gently increase vibrational entropy), and 2-4% distributed crystal seeds. These perturbations produce coexisting fluid and crystal domains with crystal fraction, phase envelope and osmotic pressure that, with systematically increasing particle hardness, approach the hard-sphere limit. These results demonstrate that slight enhancements to vibrational entropy provide a dynamically accessible route to realizing the long-range/short-range entropy exchange required for phase separation.</description>

      <title>Elucidation of the Correlation between Molecular Conformation and Shear Viscosity of Polymer Melts under Steady-State Shear Flow</title>

Abstract: The rheological behavior of polymer melts is strongly influenced by parameters such as chain length, chain stiffness, and architecture. In particular, shear thinning, characterized by a power-law decrease in shear viscosity with increasing shear rate, has been widely investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. A central question is the connection between molecular conformation under steady flow and the resulting shear-thinning response. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of linear and ring polymers with varying chain stiffness to examine this relationship, with chain conformations quantified by the gyration tensor. We identified a strong correlation between the velocity-gradient direction component of the gyration tensor and shear viscosity, which exhibits a clear scaling relationship. This indicates that chain extension along the velocity-gradient direction governs the effective frictional force. Notably, this behavior emerges as a general feature, independent of chain architecture and chain stiffness. In addition, shear viscosity was found to correlate with the component of the gyration tensor corresponding to the direction that is not directly influenced by advective effects of shear flow. Because advection is absent in the direction, polymer chains can be regarded as diffusing freely, and the extent of this diffusion appears to be controlled by the shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>

Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>
