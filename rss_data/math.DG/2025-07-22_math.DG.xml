      <title>Spectral bundles on Abelian varieties, complex projective spaces and Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the spectral analysis of Bochner-Kodaira Laplacians on an Abelian variety, complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ and a Grassmannian with a holomorphic line bundle. By imitating the method of creation and annihilation operators in physics, we convert those eigensections (of the \textquotedblleft higher energy" level) into holomorphic sections (of the \textquotedblleft lowest energy" level). This enables us to endow these spectral bundles, which are defined over the dual Abelian variety, with natural holomorphic structure. Using this conversion expressed in a concrete way, all the higher eigensections are explicitly expressible using holomorphic sections formed by theta functions. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the dimension of the space of higher-level eigensections on $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ through vanishing theorems and the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. These give a theoretical study related to some problems newly discussed by string theorists using numerical analysis. Some partial results on Grassmannians are proved and some directions for future research are indicated.</description>

      <title>Exterior differential systems on Lie algebroids and the invariant inverse problem of the calculus of variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of exterior differential systems from manifolds and their tangent bundles to Lie algebroids. In particular, we define the concept of an integral manifold of such an exterior differential system. We support our developments with several examples, including an application to dynamical systems with a symmetry group and to the invariant inverse problem of the calculus of variations.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Standard Locally Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=G/H$ be a homogeneous space, where $G \supset H$ are reductive Lie groups. We ask: in the setting where $\Gamma \backslash G/H$ is a standard quotient, to what extent can the discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ be deformed while preserving the proper discontinuity of the $\Gamma$-action on $X$?
  We provide several classification results, including: conditions under which local rigidity holds for compact standard quotients $\Gamma\backslash X$; criteria for when a standard quotient can be deformed into a nonstandard one; a characterization of the maximal Zariski-closure of discontinuous groups under small deformations; and conditions under which Zariski-dense deformations occur.
  Proofs of the results stated in this paper are provided in detail in arXiv:2507.03476.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the Curvature Operator and Applications to the Hopf Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the interplay between the curvature operator, Weyl curvature, and the Hopf conjecture on compact Riemannian manifolds of even dimension. By decomposing the curvature operator into Hermitian components, we develop eigenvalue criteria for sectional curvature and prove vanishing theorems for Betti numbers under integral bounds on the Weyl tensor. Our results confirm the Hopf conjecture for manifolds with sufficiently small Weyl curvature, including locally conformally flat cases, and provide new rigidity theorems under harmonic Weyl curvature conditions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instantons and harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between toric Ricci-flat metrics in dimension 4 and axisymmetric harmonic maps from the 3-dimensional Euclidean space into the hyperbolic plane. Applications include
  (1). The construction of complete Ricci-flat 4-manifolds that are non-spin, simply-connected, and with arbitrary second Betti number. Our method is non-perturbative and is based on ruling out conical singularities arising from axisymmetric harmonic maps. These metrics also give systematic counterexamples to various versions of the Riemannian black hole uniqueness conjecture.
  (2). A PDE classification result for axisymmetric harmonic maps of degree at most 1, via the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz and the LeBrun-Tod ansatz, in terms of axisymmetric harmonic functions. This is motivated by the study of hyperkahler and conformally Kahler gravitational instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a survey of a number of analytic and geometric results on `fibred cusp spaces'. These results cover topics in spectral geometry, in particular analytic torsion and index theory, and boundary value problems. The underlying tools include a careful microlocal analysis of the resolvent and the heat kernel. We include an exposition of the geometric and analytic foundations and sketch the ideas of the proofs of the main theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the holomorphic parabolic geometries on compact complex manifolds of general type. We accomplish this by bounding the numerical dimension of any smooth projective variety in terms of geometric invariants of the flag variety model of any holomorphic parabolic geometry on that variety. Along the way, we uncover foliations and fibrations on smooth projective varieties that admit holomorphic parabolic geometries.</description>

      <title>Positive curvature conditions on contractible manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to identify curvature conditions that distinguish Euclidean space in the case of open, contractible manifolds and the disk in the case of compact, contractible manifolds with boundary. First, we show that an open manifold that is the interior of a sufficiently connected, compact, contractible 5-manifold with boundary and supports a complete Riemannian metric with uniformly positive scalar curvature is diffeomorphic to Euclidean 5-space. Next, we investigate the analogous question for compact manifolds with boundary: Must a compact, contractible manifold that supports a Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature and mean convex boundary necessarily be the disk? We present examples demonstrating that this curvature condition alone cannot distinguish the disk; on the other hand, we exhibit stronger curvature conditions that allow us to draw such a conclusion.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions in a high codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the isometric immersion problem of Riemannian manifolds in a high codimension. It has recently been demonstrated that any short immersion from an $n$-dimensional smooth compact manifold into $2n$-dimensional Euclidean space can be uniformly approximated by $C^{1,\theta}$ isometric immersions with any $\theta\in(0,1/(n+2))$ in dimensions $n\geq3$. In this paper, we improve the H\"{o}lder regularity of the constructed isometric immersions in the local setting, achieving $C^{1,\theta}$ for all $\theta\in(0,1/n)$ in odd dimensions and all $\theta\in(0,1/(n+1))$ in even dimensions. Moreover, we also establish explicit $C^{1}$ estimates for the isometric immersions, which indicate that the larger the initial metric error is, the greater the $C^{1}$ norms of the resulting isometric maps become, meaning that their slope become steeper.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Lie-Group Formulation for the Second-Order Time Derivatives of the Inverse Dynamics of parallel Kinematic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic arms. Their model-based trajectory tracking control requires the second time derivatives of the inverse dynamics solution, for which algorithms were proposed. Trajectory control of parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) equipped with SEAs has not yet been pursued. Key element for this is the computationally efficient evaluation of the second time derivative of the inverse dynamics solution. This has not been presented in the literature, and is addressed in the present paper for the first time. The special topology of PKM is exploited reusing the recursive algorithms for evaluating the inverse dynamics of serial robots. A Lie group formulation is used and all relations are derived within this framework. Numerical results are presented for a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform (as part of an exoskeleton), and for a planar PKM when a flatness-based control scheme is applied.</description>

      <title>Stability of Gel'fand's inverse interior spectral problem for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gel'fand's inverse interior spectral problem of determining a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a potential function $q$ from the knowledge of the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ of the Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g + q$ and the restriction of the eigenfunctions $\phi_j|_U$ on a given open subset $U\subset M$, where $\Delta_g$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(M,g)$. We prove that an approximation of finitely many spectral data on $U$ determines a finite metric space that is close to $(M,g)$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, and further determines a discrete function that approximates the potential $q$ with uniform estimates. This leads to a quantitative stability estimate for the inverse interior spectral problem for Schr\"odinger operators in the general case.</description>

Abstract: In this third work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with twisted DIrichlet boundary conditions on a finite timelike boundary. The boundary conditions consist of specification of the pointwise conformal class of the boundary metric, together with a scalar density involving a combination of the volume form of the bulk metric restricted to the boundary together with the volume form of the boundary metric itself.</description>

      <title>GeoHNNs: Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric. Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and generalizable models of the physical world.</description>

After proving existence of (possibly degenerate) minimal horizontal triods, we investigate their characterization. We then formulate a horizontal curve shortening flow that deforms any given suitable initial triod into a critical point for the length functional. Numerical experiments based on a stable fully discrete finite element scheme provide useful insights into the rich landscape of this sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantitative marked length spectrum rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ of negative curvature and dimension at least 3 with marked length spectrum sufficiently close (multiplicatively) to that of a locally symmetric space $N$. Using the methods of Hamenst\"adt, we show the volumes of $M$ and $N$ are approximately equal. We then show the Besson-Courtois-Gallot map $F: M \to N$ is a diffeomorphism with derivative bounds close to 1 and depending on the ratio of the two marked length spectrum functions. Thus, we refine the results of Hamenst\"adt and Besson-Courtois-Gallot, which show $M$ and $N$ are isometric if their marked length spectra are equal. We also prove a similar result for compact negatively curved surfaces using the methods of Otal together with a version of the Gromov compactness theorem due to Pugh.</description>

      <title>The universal Euler characteristic and Burnside group for definable groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the universal Euler characteristic of orbit space definable groupoids, a class of groupoids containing cocompact proper Lie groupoids as well as translation groupoids associated to proper definable group actions. We show that every additive and multiplicative invariant of orbit space definable groupoids with an additional local triviality hypothesis arises as a ring homomorphism applied to the universal Euler characteristic. This in particular includes the $\Gamma$-orbifold Euler characteristic introduced by the first and third authors when $\Gamma$ is a finitely presented group.
  For definable groupoids, where the object and arrow spaces as well as the structure maps are definable, we also introduce a Burnside group (which admits a partial multiplication), which generalizes the classical Burnside ring associated to compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Aspherical Complex Surfaces, the Singer Conjecture, and Gromov-L\"uck Inequality $\chi \geq |\sigma|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Singer conjecture and Gromov-L\"uck inequality $\chi \geq |\sigma|$ for aspherical complex surfaces. We give a proof of the Singer conjecture for aspherical complex surface with residually finite fundamental group that does not rely on Gromov's K\"ahler groups theory. Without the residually finiteness assumption, we observe that this conjecture can be proven for all aspherical complex surfaces except possibly those in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$ (a positive answer to the global spherical shell conjecture would rule out the existence of aspherical surfaces in this class). We also sharpen Gromov's inequality for aspherical complex surfaces that are not in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$. This is achieved by connecting the circle of ideas of the Singer conjecture with the study of Reid's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Graded supermanifolds and homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold which is, roughly speaking, a supermanifold equipped with a privileged atlas whose coordinates have certain (real) homogeneity degrees. This defines a sheaf of graded algebras on the supermanifold, which is an additional structure on the supermanifold. The main principle of this approach is that grading is ultimately related to homogeneity. But assigning consistently homogeneity degrees to coordinates is the same as fixing a certain global vector field, the weight vector field. This approach is simple and more general than most of the approaches to graded manifolds present in the literature. In particular, the homogeneity degrees can be arbitrary reals, and the corresponding category includes compact supermanifolds. We systematically study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroup, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, and other related concepts like double homogeneity. The main achievements in this framework are proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma and a homogeneous analog of the Darboux Theorem, which seem to be interesting even for purely even homogeneity manifolds.</description>

      <title>Minimal isometric immersions of flat n-tori into spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1985, Bryant stated that a flat $2$-torus admits a minimal isometric immersion into some round sphere if and only if a certain rationality condition is satisfied. We show that the rationality criterion is no longer a necessary, but a sufficient condition for a flat $n$-torus to admit minimal isometric immersions into spheres. We also derive an upper bound for the algebraic irrationality degree of such immersion. This bound is sharp and equals 4 if $n=3$, and explicit embedded examples are provided respectively for each possible degree. A non-homogeneous example is also presented to show that the minimal isometric immersion of flat $n$-tori is no longer necessarily homogeneous when $n\geq 3$. Moreover, we establish a deformation theorem that every flat n-torus admitting a minimal isometric spherical immersion can be isometrically, minimally and homogeneously immersed into a sphere of dimension at most $n^2+n-1$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a sharp Fenchel-Willmore inequality for closed submanifolds of arbitrary dimension and codimension immersed in a complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative intermediate Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth. In the hypersurface case, this reduces to non-negative Ricci curvature. We also characterize the equality case. This generalizes the recent work of Agostiniani, Fogagnolo, and Mazzieri \cite{Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri}, as well as classical results by Chen, Fenchel, Willmore, and others.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>On the Ubiquity of (Almost) Contact Structures in Hot MQCD at Intermediate Coupling</title>

Abstract: Relevant to top-down ${\cal M}$-theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling, induced by the $G_2$ structure supported by the closed $M_7$ - a warped product of the ${\cal M}$-theory circle and a non-K\"{a}hler six-fold which is the warped product of the thermal circle with a non-Einsteinian deformation of $T^{1,1}$ - we obtain explicitly (Almost) Contact (3) (Metric)Structure(s) and a three-tuple of $SU(3)$ structures along the "transverse" six-fold induced by the AC(3)MS on $M_7$. A novel result in this context is that in the Infra-Red, within the parameter space of AC3S arising from G2 structures, the subspaces of C3S and AC3S are not mutually "N-path connected". Relevance of the results to staying out of the non-supersymmetric swampland, entanglement entropy of eternal black holes, chaos, bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$, paramagnetic plasma EoS and photoproduction in a strong magnetic field, in the context of top-down holographic thermal QCD at intermediate coupling, is highlighted/reiterated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of "hyperbolic directions" in groups acting cocompactly on properly convex domains in real projective space, from three different perspectives simultaneously: the (coarse) metric geometry of the Hilbert metric, the projective geometry of the boundary of the domain, and the singular value gaps of projective automorphisms. We describe the relationship between different definitions of "Morse" and "regular" quasi-geodesics arising in these three different contexts. This generalizes several results of Benoist and Guichard to the non-Gromov hyperbolic setting.</description>

Abstract: We show that, inside the Shilov boundary of any given Hermitian symmetric space of tube type, there is, up to isomorphism, only one proper domain such that every point on its boundary belongs to the closure of an orbit under its automorphism group. This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

Abstract: We prove the transitivity of real Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are Anosov diffeomorphisms where stable and unstable spaces decompose into a continuous sum of invariant one-dimensional sub-spaces with uniform contraction/expansion over the ambient manifold. We prove that if a stable/unstable curve has a well-defined length in a conformal hyperbolic distance, then it has a globally defined holonomy. We exhibit a conformal hyperbolic distance with well-defined length of stable/unstable curves for each real Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \cong M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like' time'. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston and violates the cosmological principle. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic indistinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>
