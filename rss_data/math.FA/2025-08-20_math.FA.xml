      <title>Isometries of James-Schreier and Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the group of surjective linear isometries on certain real Banach sequence spaces using the preservation of extreme points in the closed unit ball. Our main result provides a characterization of the extreme points of the dual unit ball of the James-Schreier space $V_1$. As a consequence, we show that the only isometries on $V_1$ are $\pm Id$. We also obtain a Banach-Stone-type result for Lorentz sequence spaces, analogous to one proved in \cite{CarothersIsometrisLorentz} for Lorentz function spaces.</description>

      <title>Best approximation from the positive cone of an inner product lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a directed (i.e., positively generated) ordered vector space endowed with an inner product. In this note, we prove that the following statements are equivalent:
i) $E$ is a vector lattice and its norm induced by its inner product is a lattice norm.
ii) The metric projection onto the positive cone $E^+$ of $E$ exists and it is both isotone and subadditive.
Moreover, in this case, the best approximation to any $x \in E$ from $E^+$ coincides with its positive part $x^+$. This result extends previous work to the non-complete setting.</description>

      <title>Positive polynomials and the truncated moment problem on plane cubics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The truncated moment problem supported on a given closed set $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ($K$-TMP) asks to characterize conditions for a given linear functional on bivariate polynomials of bounded degree to have an integral representation with respect to a Borel measure $\mu$ with $\text{supp}\mu\subseteq K$. The solutions to the $K$-TMP are known for $K$, which is a line, a quadratic curve, and for some cases of cubic curves. In this paper, we solve the $C$-TMP for every cubic curve $C$. Our first result states that the extreme rays of the cone of polynomials of bounded degree, nonnegative on $C$, have only real zeroes. This result allows us to establish certificates for the positivity of polynomials on $C$ with degree bounds. To obtain concrete forms of these certificates, a case-by-case analysis is required. Up to affine linear change of variables, we divide cubics into 29 cases, 13 irreducible and 16 reducible ones. Using the certificates, we concretely solve the nonsingular $C$-TMP in terms of positive semidefiniteness of two or three localizing moment matrices. In most irreducible cases, we also provide constructive solutions to the nonsingular and singular $C$-TMPs, which can be used to compute a representing measure concretely. Upper bounds for the Carath\'eodory number are also obtained, which in some cases are sharp or differ by at most 1 from the sharp bound.</description>

      <title>The Kaczmarz Algorithm in Hilbert $C^{*}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kaczmarz algorithm in Hilbert spaces is a classical iterative method for stably recovering vectors from inner product data. In this paper, we extend the algorithm to the setting of Hilbert $C^*$-modules and establish analogues of its effectiveness in both finite-dimensional and stationary cases. Consequently, we demonstrate that continuous families of elements in a Hilbert space can be uniformly recovered using the Kaczmarz algorithm. Additionally, we develop a normalized Cauchy transform for continuous families of measures and use it to provide sufficient conditions under which standard frames in Hilbert $C(X)$-modules can be generated by the Kaczmarz algorithm and realized as orbits of bounded operators.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Bounds on the Fourier sampling numbers of Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}^d$ denote the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the problem of optimally recovering a target function $f^*:\mathbb{T}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ from samples of its Fourier coefficients. We make classical smoothness assumptions on $f^*$, specifically that $f^*$ lies in a Besov space $B^s_\infty(L_q)$ with $s &gt; 0$ and $1\leq q\leq \infty$, and measure recovery error in the $L_p$-norm with $1\leq p\leq \infty$. Abstractly, the optimal recovery error is characterized by a `restricted' version of the Gelfand widths, which we call the Fourier sampling numbers. Up to logarithmic factors, we determine the correct asymptotics of the Fourier sampling numbers in the regime $s/d &gt; 1 - 1/p$. We also give a description of nearly optimal Fourier measurements and recovery algorithms in each of these cases. In the other direction, we prove a novel lower bound showing that there is an asymptotic gap between the Fourier sampling numbers and the Gelfand widths when $q = 1$ and $p_0 &lt; p\leq 2$ with $p_0 \approx 1.535$. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results, which imply a sharper recovery of edges, and provide numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every nearly spherical, positively curved surface is the contractive, volume-preserving image of a round sphere. The proof combines three main tools: the Ricci flow on surfaces, the Kim-Milman construction, and a multiscale Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>

      <title>Geodesic convexity and strengthened functional inequalities in submanifolds of Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geodesic convexity of various energy and entropy functionals restricted to (non-geodesically convex) submanifolds of Wasserstein spaces with their induced geometry. We prove a variety of convexity results by means of a simple general principle, which holds in the metric space setting, and which crucially requires no knowledge of the structure of geodesics in the submanifold: If the EVI gradient flow of a functional exists and leaves the submanifold invariant, then the restriction of the functional to the submanifold is geodesically convex. This leads to short new proofs of several known results, such as one of Carlen and Gangbo on strong convexity of entropy on sphere-like submanifolds, and several new results, such as the $\lambda$-convexity of entropy on the space of couplings of $\lambda$-log-concave marginals. Along the way, we develop sufficient conditions for existence of geodesics in Wasserstein submanifolds. Submanifold convexity results lead systematically to improvements of Talagrand and HWI inequalities which we speculate to be closely related to concentration of measure estimates for conditioned empirical measures, and we prove one rigorous result in this direction in the Carlen-Gangbo setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hardy and spectral gap inequalities on special irreversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharpness of various Hardy-type inequalities is well-understood in the reversible Finsler setting; while infinite reversibility implies the failure of these functional inequalities, cf. Krist\'aly, Huang, and Zhao [Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 2020]. However, in the remaining case of irreversible manifolds with finite reversibility, there is no evidence on the sharpness of Hardy-type inequalities. In fact, we are not aware of any particular examples where the sharpness persists. In this paper we present two such examples involving two celebrated inequalities: the classical/weighted Hardy inequality (assuming non-positive flag curvature) and the McKean-type spectral gap estimate (assuming strong negative flag curvature). In both cases, we provide a family of Finsler metric measure manifolds on which these inequalities are sharp. We also establish some sufficient conditions, which guarantee the sharpness of more involved Hardy-type inequalities on these spaces. Our relevant technical tool is a Finslerian extension of the method of Riccati pairs (for proving Hardy inequalities), which also inspires the main ideas of our constructions.</description>

      <title>A few last words on pointwise multipliers of Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will provide a complete description of the space $M(X_F,X_G)$ of pointwise multipliers between two Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces $X_F$ and $X_G$ built upon a rearrangement invariant space $X$ and two Young functions $F$ and $G$. Meeting natural expectations, the space $M(X_F,X_G)$ turns out to be another Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} space $X_{G \ominus F}$ with $G \ominus F$ being the appropriately understood generalized Young conjugate of $G$ with respect to $F$. Nevertheless, our argument is not a mere transplantation of existing techniques and requires a rather delicate analysis of the interplay between the space $X$ and functions $F$ and $G$. Furthermore, as an example to illustrate applications, we will solve the factorization problem for Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces. All this not only complements and improves earlier results (basically giving them the final touch), but also confirms the conjecture formulated by Kolwicz, Le\'snik and Maligranda in [Pointwise multipliers of Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces, Math. Nachr. 286 (2012), no. 8-9, 876--907]. We will close this work by formulating a number of open questions that outline a promising panorama for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Toeplitz operators are norm dense in the Toeplitz algebra $\mathfrak{T}(L^\infty)$ over the weighted Bergman space $\mathcal{A}^2_\nu(\Omega)$ of a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$. Our methods use representation theory, quantum harmonic analysis, and weakly-localized operators. Additionally, we note that the set of all $\alpha$-weakly-localized operators form a self-adjoint algebra, containing the set of all Toeplitz operators, whose norm closure coincides with the Toeplitz algebra.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study the Rhaly operator on K\"othe spaces, with a primary focus on understanding its well-definedness, continuity, and compactness. We especially examine operators acting on power series spaces of both infinite and finite type. In the sequel, we provide integral representations for the Rhaly operator on the space of entire functions $H(\mathbb{C})$ and the space of holomorphic functions on the unit disc $H(\mathbb{D})$. We also investigate the topologizability and power boundedness of the Rhaly operators, which leads to findings about their mean ergodicity, uniform mean ergodicity, and Ces\`aro boundedness.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting, we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [44], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [50].</description>

      <title>Frechet and Mordukhovich Derivative (Coderivative) and Covering Constant for Single-Valued Mapping in Euclidean Space with Applications (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (or coderivatives) of single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces. At first, we prove the guideline for calculating the Frechet derivatives of single-valued mappings by their partial derivatives. Then, by using the connections between Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (or coderivatives) of single-valued mappings in Banach spaces, we derive the useful rules for calculating the Mordukhovich derivatives of single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces. For practicing these rules, we find the precise solutions of the Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives for some single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces (in R^2, it can be extended to R^n). By using these solutions, we will find the covering constants for the considered mappings. As applications of the results about the covering constants and by applying the Arutyunov Mordukhovich and Zhukovskiy Parameterized Coincidence Point Theorem, we solve some parameterized equations.</description>

Abstract: We continue the study in part I for calculating the Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (coderivatives) and covering constants for single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces (It is part I). In this paper, we particularly consider a norm-reserved mapping f: R^2 to R^2 that is defined by (1.1) in Section 1. We will find the precise solutions of Frechet derivative and Mordukhovich derivative at every point in R^2. By using these solutions, we will find the covering constant for this mapping f is exact 1 at every point in R^2 except the origin. Then we extend this mapping to R^4. Finally, by using the covering constant for f and by applying the Arutyunov Mordukhovich and Zhukovskiy Parameterized Coincidence Point Theorem, we will solve some parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>Langevin Monte-Carlo Provably Learns Depth Two Neural Nets at Any Size and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>

      <title>Affine Logarithmic HLS and Beckner-Type Logarithmic Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two limiting cases ($\alpha\rightarrow n$ and $\alpha\rightarrow 0 $) of the recent affine HLS inequalities by Haddad and Ludwig. As $\alpha\rightarrow n$, the affine logarithmic HLS inequality is established, which is stronger than the logarithmic HLS inequality by Carlen and Loss from 1992 and Beckner from 1993. As $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, an affine version of Beckner's logarithmic Sobolev inequality is established, which is also a limiting case of the affine fractional $L^2$ Sobolev inequalities. The affine logarithmic Sobolev inequality is stronger than the original version by Beckner from 1995.</description>
