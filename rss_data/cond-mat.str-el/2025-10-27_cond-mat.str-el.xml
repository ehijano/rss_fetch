      <title>A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we consider the lattice with sites at the vertices, edges and facets of the triangulation. Borrowing from mathematics literature, we introduce on this lattice a pair of tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of finite simplicial manifolds. These Hamiltonians have been proved to have clean topological spectral gaps carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.</description>

      <title>The generic Mott transition in the sine-Gordon model through an embedded worm algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic Mott transition in one-dimensional quantum systems can be described by the sine-Gordon model with a tilt via bosonization. Because the configuration space of the sine-Gordon model separates into distinct topological sectors, standard local Monte Carlo schemes are limited to very small system sizes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the smooth worm (SmoWo) Monte Carlo algorithm which enlarges the configuration space to allow smooth transitions between topological sectors. The method combines worm updates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity and quantify its performance. Thanks to the substantial acceleration achieved by the SmoWo algorithm, we are able to simulate large system sizes, providing a precise picture of the different phases and critical behaviour of the sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Metal-to-Insulator Transitions in 2D Moir\'e Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcitation has been utilized to control quantum matter and to uncover metastable phases far from equilibrium. Among demonstrations to date, the most common is the photo-induced transition from correlated insulators to metallic states; however, the reverse process without initial orders has not been observed. Here, we show ultrafast metal-to-insulator transition in gate-doped WS2/WSe2 and WSe2/WSe2 moir\'e devices using photo-thermionic hole injection from graphite gates. The resulting correlated insulators are metastable, with lifetimes exceeding microseconds. These findings establish an effective mechanism for the ultrafast control of correlated electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge-Doping via Photo-Thermionic Injection in van der Waals Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from the target layers, such as moir\'e interfaces, but also to additional device functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical excitation in a prototypical moir\'e device of dual-gated twisted WSe2 bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moir\'e bilayer from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by: (i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy, fluence, and gate bias.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic electron-nuclear spin entanglement in HoCo2Zn20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated electron-nuclear spin entanglement in the paramagnetic ground state of the Ho-based cubic compound HoCo2Zn20. From analyses of magnetization and specific heat data, we determined the cubic crystalline electric field (CEF) parameters, the magnetic exchange constant, and the hyperfine coupling constant between the 4f magnetic moment and the 165Ho nuclear spin. Our results show that the Gamma5 CEF ground state is split by the hyperfine coupling, with an energy width of 1.3 K at 0 T, and that the true paramagnetic ground state is a quasi-sextet arising primarily from entanglement between the f-electron effective spin S = 1 and the 165Ho nuclear spin I = 7/2. We further demonstrate that, depending on the CEF parameters, the paramagnetic ground state can switch to an electron-nuclear coupled dectet. These findings underscore the importance of accurately identifying the electron-nuclear level scheme for understanding the low-temperature properties of rare-earth compounds containing spin-active nuclei.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in an interacting model of Kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice is a widely used interacting model for describing the electronic properties of various transition metal-based Kagome materials. We find altermagnetism driven by Coulomb interaction in the Kagome Hubbard model at Dirac filling with no spin-orbit coupling nor explicit spatial symmetry breaking present. We show how this insulating altermagnet is relevant to other lattices with larger unit cells such as the Lieb-Kagome lattice. The ALM found displays a characteristic magnon splitting which can be detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on interacting Kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the crystal electric-field splitting under magnetic field and uncovering field-induced magnetic phase transition in triangular rare-earth magnet CsErSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interaction in rare-earth magnets is the determination of spatially anisotropic single-ion properties resulting from the crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian exhibits a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of independent parameters that reflect the site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters for magnetic ions at low-symmetry sites has been proven highly challenging. In this study, we directly measured the CEF level splitting under magnetic fields (B) using optical spectroscopy and extracted both CEF parameters and the exchange energies of a triangular insulating magnet CsErSe$_2$ as a model system. With increasing field, we find many CEF levels undergo level-crossing, which accompanies switching of the eigenstate. Particularly, such a crossing occurring at the ground state results in a step-like increase in magnetization that we captured with the low-temperature AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our work demonstrates that the accurately determined CEF Hamiltonian parameters enable uncovering the rich physics of field-induced collective magnetic phenomena, and potentially lead to a new route to magnetic frustration.</description>

Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</description>

      <title>Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Local-to-Global Entanglement Dynamics by Periodically Driving Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T&gt;T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T&lt;T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <title>Optimal superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band $t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced nematic and stripe orders within the charge density wave state of TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theory to address conflicting experimental claims regarding the charge density wave (CDW) state in TiSe$_2$, including whether there is a single or multiple CDW transitions and whether threefold rotation symmetry ($C_3$) is broken. Using a continuum $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ model coupled to the CDW order parameter, we show how commonplace conduction band doping induces a nematic transition from a $C_3$-symmetric $3Q$ CDW to a $C_3$-breaking $3Q$ CDW, which is favored by the large ellipticity of the conduction bands of TiSe$_2$. We also find that a $1Q$ stripe CDW is generically stabilized for sufficiently high electron doping. We then show how both stripe and nematic CDW states emerge self-consistently from a minimal interacting tight-binding model, for both positive and negative initial gaps. Our theory provides a new scenario in which, as temperature is lowered, a second $C_3$-breaking transition may occur or not depending on the doping level, potentially explaining the experimental variability. These predictions can be further verified with a variety of probes including transport, photoemission and tunneling.</description>

      <title>Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.</description>

      <title>Developments in the applications of density functional theory to fractional quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, which manifests as fractionalized excitations and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion theory. This paper systematically evaluates how density functional theory approaches have addressed fundamental challenges in fractional quantum Hall systems, including ground state and low-energy excitations. Special attention is given to the insights provided by density functional theory regarding composite fermion behavior, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. The discussion critically examines both the advantages and limitations of these approaches, while highlighting the productive interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. Future directions are explored, particularly the promising potential of time-dependent density functional theory for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum spin ice to matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy physics of quantum spin ice is known to support an emergent form of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where magnetic monopoles exist and the fine structure constant is material dependent. In this article, we show how this QED is modified via a coupling to dynamical matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice, a structure which has recently been synthesized using metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, we study the low-energy properties of the $S = 1/2$ quantum XXZ model on the centered pyrochlore lattice, with a focus on the sign-problem free region. At fourth order in degenerate perturbation theory this model hosts a quantum spin liquid distinct from the well-known U(1) quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore due to the presence of dynamical matter in the ground state. Exact diagonalization results are consistent with this quantum spin liquid over an extended region of the ground state phase diagram although potential quantum critical points within this region could indicate a richer phase structure. Our work thus expands the physics of quantum spin ice in an experimentally motivated geometry, showing how the emergent QED can be coupled to dynamical matter at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>From Confinement to Chaos in AdS/CFT Correspondence via Non-equilibrium Local States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to local operator quenches in a free bulk scalar theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual CFT states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff (hard-wall), creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators, the spacing-ratio statistics of peaks in temporal dynamics are closest to those of the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Finally, we extend the analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and to its hard-wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar trends.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of Flat-Band and All-Bands-Flat Dynamics for Tunable Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.</description>
