      <title>The relationship between the structural transitions of DMPG membranes and the melting process, and their interaction with water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the melting transition of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), the order of the lipid chains and the three-dimensional, vesicular structural arrangement change simultaneously. These changes result in peculiar heat capacity profiles extended over a broad temperature range with seven $c_p$-maxima. Here, we present calorimetric, viscosity, and volume expansion coefficient data at various ionic strengths and charges. We propose a simple theory that explains the calorimetric data in terms of the coexistence of two membrane geometries, both of which can melt. During the transition, the equilibrium between these two geometries changes cooperatively. This equilibrium depends on the interactions between the membranes and the solvent, on the membrane's charge and the ionic strength of the buffer. Solvent interactions also contribute to the volume change of the membrane phases. Unlike uncharged membranes, we find that enthalpy changes are no longer proportional to volume changes. Therefore, the pressure dependence of the calorimetric profiles differs from that of uncharged membranes. Our theory explains the pressure dependence of calorimetric profiles qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same theory can be used to describe pretransition and ripple formation in phosphatidylcholines. A key takeaway from this article is that solvent molecules (e.g., H2O) are part of the membrane and, in the case of DMPG, water cannot be considered a separate phase.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature, yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. At high densities, this suppression generates an active nematic state, sustained by continuous defect creation and annihilation but lacking global order. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, which reduce the effective persistence length and enlarge the effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>

      <title>Coarsening of biomimetic condensates in a self-stirring active fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarsening, the process where larger structures grow at the expense of smaller ones, is a fundamental aspect of multiphase systems. The cell cytoplasm exemplifies an out-of-equilibrium multiphase system, where phase-separated condensates nucleate and expand within an active fluid made of biopolymers and energy-dependent enzymes. In this study, we explore how condensates grow in a self-stirring active fluid by examining the coarsening of biomimetic condensates embedded in a 3D reconstituted cytoskeleton composed of microtubules and molecular motors. The strong agreement among experiments, an active hydrodynamic model, and computer simulations offers a comprehensive framework that explains why self-similarity is absent in active coarsening and identifies the origins of the continuously changing coarsening exponents for both active and passive condensates. The dynamics of coarsening are primarily determined by the statistics of binary droplet collisions, which depend on their size-dependent motility, regardless of whether they are active or passive. These results reveal a unifying control parameter for the coarsening process and size distribution of active condensates, broadening our understanding of phase separation in out-of-equilibrium systems and potentially impacting materials science and biology.</description>

      <title>Emulating microbial run-and-tumble and tactic motion by stochastically reorienting synthetic active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicating efficient and adaptable microbial navigation strategies, such as run and tumble (RnT) and tactic motions to synthetic active agents has been an enduring quest. To this end, we introduce a stochastic orientational reset (SOR) protocol, in which the propulsion direction of an active Brownian particle (ABP) is reassigned to a random orientation within a defined reset-cone. When the reset-cone is aligned with the instantaneous propulsion direction, ABPs reproduce the RnT dynamics of E. coli; when set along an attractant gradient, they exhibit taxis - with extensive adaptability in persistence through the angular width of the reset-cone and reset rate. We establish the robustness of this protocol across a broad range of swimming speeds using experiments, simulations, and analytical theory.</description>

      <title>Introduction of modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Toward a Physics of Deep Learning and Brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks and brains both learn and share superficial similarities: processing nodes are likened to neurons and adjustable weights are likened to modifiable synapses. But can a unified theoretical framework be found to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describe neuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of activity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from non-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn best when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Cockroaches adjust body and appendages to traverse cluttered large obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To traverse complex natural terrain, animals often transition between locomotor modes. It is well known that locomotor transitions can be induced by switching in neural control circuits or be driven by a need to minimize metabolic energetic cost. Recent work discovered that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain cluttered with large obstacles can also emerge from physical interaction with the environment controlled by the nervous system. To traverse cluttered, stiff grass-like beams, the discoid cockroach often transitions from using a strenuous pitch mode to push across to using a less strenuous roll mode to maneuver through the gaps, during which a potential energy barrier must be overcome. Although previous robotic physical modeling demonstrated that kinetic energy fluctuation from body oscillation generated by leg propulsion can help overcome the barrier and facilitate this transition, the animal was observed to transition even when the barrier still exceeds kinetic energy fluctuation. Here, we further studied whether and how the cockroach makes active adjustments to facilitate this locomotor transition to traverse cluttered beams. We observed that the animal flexed its head and abdomen, reduced hind leg sprawl, and used both hind legs differentially during the pitch-to-roll transition, which were absent when running on a flat ground. Using a refined potential energy landscape with additional degrees of freedom modeling these adjustments, we found that head flexion did not substantially reduce the transition barrier, whereas the leg sprawl reduction did so dramatically. We discussed likely functions of the observed adjustments and suggested future directions.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>From spirals to flagellar beating: How pivot-like defects control semiflexible filament dynamics in motility assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that internal pivot-like defects, arising from rigor mutant motor proteins that bind without stepping, fundamentally reshape the dynamics of semiflexible filaments in two-dimensional motility assays. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we show that such internal pivots establish a previously unrecognized boundary condition, intermediate between free and clamped filaments, that decisively governs filament behavior. Strikingly, by tuning the pivot position, motor activity, and processivity, filaments undergo sharp transitions from tightly wound spiral states to extended, flagella-like beating. Spiral formation is stabilized by a balance between motor-driven forces and bending rigidity, with intermediate stiffness yielding the most robust spirals. Unlike generic active polymer models, our framework isolates the distinct role of rigor-bound motor proteins, revealing how they function as internal control elements governing the transition between spiral and flagellar dynamics. This minimal yet physically grounded model yields experimentally testable predictions and reveals how localized defects can act as key regulators of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics.</description>

      <title>The need for and feasibility of alternative ground robots to traverse sandy and rocky extraterrestrial terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic spacecraft have helped expand our reach for many planetary exploration missions. Most ground mobile planetary exploration robots use wheeled or modified wheeled platforms. Although extraordinarily successful at completing intended mission goals, because of the limitations of wheeled locomotion, they have been largely limited to benign, solid terrain and avoided extreme terrain with loose soil/sand and large rocks. Unfortunately, such challenging terrain is often scientifically interesting for planetary geology. Although many animals traverse such terrain at ease, robots have not matched their performance and robustness. This is in major part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how effective locomotion can be generated from controlled interaction with complex terrain on the same level of flight aerodynamics and underwater vehicle hydrodynamics. Early fundamental understanding of legged and limbless locomotor-ground interaction has already enabled stable and efficient bio-inspired robot locomotion on relatively flat ground with small obstacles. Recent progress in the new field of terradynamics of locomotor-terrain interaction begins to reveal the principles of bio-inspired locomotion on loose soil/sand and over large obstacles. Multi-legged and limbless platforms using terradynamics insights hold the promise for serving as robust alternative platforms for traversing extreme extraterrestrial terrain and expanding our reach in planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Simulation of snakes using vertical body bending to traverse terrain with large height variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snake moves across various terrains by bending its elongated body. Recent studies discovered that snakes can use vertical bending to traverse terrain of large height variation, such as horizontally oriented cylinders, a wedge (Jurestovsky, Usher, Astley, 2021, J. Exp. Biol.), and uneven terrain (Fu &amp; Li, 2020, Roy. Soc. Open Sci.; Fu, Astley, Li, 2022 Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics). Here, to understand how vertical bending generates propulsion, we developed a dynamic simulation of a snake traversing a wedge (height = 0.05 body length, slope = 27 degrees) and a half cylindrical obstacle (height = 0.1 body length). By propagating down the body an internal torque profile with a maximum around the obstacle, the simulated snake moved forward as observed in the animal. Remarkably, even when frictional drag is low (snake-terrain kinetic friction coefficient of 0.20), the body must push against the wedge with a pressure 5 times that from body weight to generate sufficient forward propulsion to move forward. This indicated that snakes are highly capable of bending vertically to push against the environment to generate propulsion. Testing different controllers revealed that contact force feedback further helps generate and maintain propulsion effectively under unknown terrain perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>
