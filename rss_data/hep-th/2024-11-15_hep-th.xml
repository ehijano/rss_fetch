      <title>Thermal Pseudo-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of quantum field theory in de Sitter: the C, F and A theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the irreversibility of the renormalization group for quantum field theory in de Sitter space in $d=2$, $3$ and $4$ space-time dimensions. The proof is based on strong subadditivity of the entanglement entropy, de Sitter invariance, and the Markov property of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Does decoherence violate decoupling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent calculations in both flat and de Sitter spacetimes have highlighted a tension between the decoupling of high-energy physics from low-energy degrees of freedom and the expectation that quantum systems decohere due to interactions with unknown environments. In effective field theory (EFT), integrating out heavy fields should lead to Hamiltonian time evolution, which preserves the purity of low-energy states. This is consistent with the fact that we never observe isolated quantum states spontaneously decohering in the vacuum due to unknown high-energy physics. However, when a heavy scalar of mass $M$ is traced out, the resulting purity of a light scalar with mass $m$ typically appears to scale as a power of $1/M$ (when $m\ll M$), an effect that cannot be captured by a local effective Hamiltonian. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the purity depends on the resolution scale of the EFT and how the environment is traced out. We provide a practical method for diagnosing the purity of low-energy states consistent with EFT expectations, and briefly discuss some of the implications these observations have for how ultraviolet divergences can appear in decoherence calculations.</description>

      <title>Perturbatively exact supersymmetric partition functions of ABJM theory on Seifert manifolds and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive analysis of the supersymmetric partition function of the $\text{U}(N)_k\times\text{U}(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory on a Seifert manifold, evaluating it to all orders in the $1/N$-perturbative expansion up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Through holographic duality, our perturbatively exact result is successfully matched with the regularized on-shell action of a dual Euclidean AdS$_4$-Taub-Bolt background incorporating 4-derivative corrections, and also provides valuable insights into the logarithmic corrections that emerge from the 1-loop calculations in M-theory path integrals. In this process, we revisit the Euclidean AdS$_4$-Taub-Bolt background carefully, elucidating the flat connection in the background graviphoton field. This analysis umambiguously determines the U(1)$_R$ holonomy along the Seifert fiber, thereby solidifying the holographic comparison regarding the partition function on a large class of Seifert manifolds.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and Uniqueness of Duality Cascades in Three Dimensions for Affine Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three-dimensional circular-quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories, the questions, whether duality cascades always terminate and whether the endpoint is unique, were rephrased into the question whether a polytope defined in the parameter space of relative ranks for duality cascades is a parallelotope, filling the space by discrete translations. By regarding circular quivers as affine Dynkin diagrams, we generalize the arguments into other affine quivers. We find that, after rewriting properties into the group-theoretical language, most arguments work in the generalizations. Especially, we find that, instead of the original relation to parallelotopes, the corresponding polytope still fills the parameter space but with some gaps. This indicates that, under certain restrictions, duality cascades still terminate uniquely.</description>

      <title>Cancelling mod-2 anomalies by Green-Schwarz mechanism with $B_{\mu\nu}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study if and when mod-2 anomalies can be canceled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism with the introduction of an antisymmetric tensor field $B_{\mu\nu}$. As explicit examples, we examine $SU(2)$ and more general $Sp(n)$ gauge theories in four and eight dimensions. We find that the mod-2 anomalies of 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(n)$ gauge theory can be canceled, as expected from it having a string theory realization, while the mod-2 Witten anomaly of 4d $SU(2)$ and $Sp(n)$ gauge theory cannot be canceled in this manner.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of Lorentz-Violating Yang-Mills theories: Gauge invariance and non-perturbative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous investigations on the renormalizability properties of Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills (LVYM) theories in the Landau gauge have pointed out the necessity of the inclusion of a mass-like term for the gauge fields. If one aims at generalizing the theory to a more complicated gauge, such a mass-like term can bring severe issues regarding gauge-dependence of correlation functions of observables. We propose a Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills theory supplemented by a gauge-invariant mass term which generalizes the model in the Landau gauge. We discuss the foundational aspects of the model and highlight how it simplifies in the Landau gauge. Following the recent literature in pure Yang-Mills theories, we remark how the proposed massive extension of LVYM theories can be used as an effective model to access infrared properties within perturbation theory. Finally, we present a BRST-invariant formulation of the so-called Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in the presence of Lorentz-violating terms in linear covariant gauges and the underlying tree-level gauge-field propagator which is enriched by the non-perturbative information carried by the elimination of Gribov copies.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Relativistic Quantum Information from Effective Field Theory Approach with Implications to Contextual Meanings of Locality and Quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work \cite{biggs2024comparing}, the effective field theory (EFT) is adopted to consider the quantum decoherence of a near-horizon Unrhu-DeWitt (UDW) charged qubit in a macroscopic cat state. We generalize this EFT approach to study the relativistic quantum information (RQI) of two static UDW-charged qubits with or without a black hole. This EFT is obtained by integrating out a massless mediator field, yielding the direct Coulombic interactions among intrinsic multipole moments of UDW detectors and the induced one on the black hole. The RQI of the quantum state of the mediator field can be probed by the reduced final states of UDW detectors by tracing out the induced internal states of the black hole. From the reduced final state, we find the patterns of entanglement harvesting agree with the ones obtained by the conventional approach based on master theory. However, the more detailed study suggests that the contextual meanings of (non-)locality may or may not be the same in quantum field theory (QFT) and RQI. To explore the contextual meanings of quantumness and locality more, we also calculate quantum discord and locality bound of the Bell-type experiments, with the former characterizing the non-classical correlations and the latter the (non-)locality in the hidden-variable context of RQI. We find that QFT and RQI agree on quantumness based on different physical reasons but may not agree on locality.</description>

      <title>The Instability of Low-Temperature Black Holes in Gauged $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the static planar black hole solutions in the STU model of the gauged $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity in four dimensions. We give a straightforward derivation of the equation of state of the purely electric and purely magnetic solutions with four charges. Then we give a simple proof that the determinant of the Hessian of the energy is always negative below some critical finite temperature for the purely electric solutions. We compute the spinodal line for the usual planar Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in four dimensions. Inspired by the magnetic superalgebra we show that the supersymmetric solutions are metastable if the energy is restricted to satisfy the topological twist condition ab initio and it is shifted to be zero on the BPS solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on previous works, in this article we systematically analyze the implications of the explicit normal modes of a probe scalar sector in a BTZ background with a Dirichlet wall, in an asymptotically AdS-background. This is a Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We demonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut along the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this approximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and the corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator, associated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the right-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically, that the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: {\it e.g.}~there is an emergent {\it strong thermalization} due to these modes, adding further support to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We explicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that the one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary condition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This provides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global quench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the horizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient features of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This also provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics emerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical account of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Replica wormhole and AMPS firewall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for generating an AMPS firewall from the replica wormhole topology, which describes the post-Page time spacetime in the evaporation process of a black hole. Our analysis reveals that this topology gives rise to a Dirac delta force experienced by infalling particles at the event horizon, consistent with the AMPS firewall hypothesis. This force, proportional to the particle's total energy squared, is a direct consequence of the inherent Dirac delta in the Ricci scalar of the replica wormhole. We provide a regularization scheme for this force, which is crucial for obtaining physically meaningful results. Notably, our approach suggests that considering the replica wormhole resolves both the information paradox and the AMPS argument regarding the monogamy of entanglement simultaneously, yielding a more coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Islands for black holes in a hybrid quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous work on hybrid quantum states in the RST model, we study its most interesting solution representing a completely regular spacetime with the structure of causal diamond, containing an apparent horizon and radiation at infinity. Adapting recent computations of radiation entropy in terms of the entropy of entanglement, we find that this entropy follows a Page curve. This confirms our previous result [1], which was obtained by directly calculating the thermodynamic entropy of radiation at infinity. We also investigate the presence of a possible island in these systems, and find that it does not seem to play a role in contributing to the generalized black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Non-Locality induces Isometry and Factorisation in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holography, two manifestations of the black hole information paradox are given by the non-isometric nature of the bulk-boundary map and by the factorisation puzzle. By considering time-shifted microstates of the eternal black hole, we demonstrate that both these puzzles may be simultaneously resolved by taking into account non-local quantum corrections that correspond to wormholes arising from state averaging. This is achieved by showing, using a resolvent technique, that the resulting Hilbert space for an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space is finite-dimensional with a discrete energy spectrum. The latter gives rise to a transition to a type I von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Differential Representation for Carrollian Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential representation of AdS correlators offers a framework to express exchange Witten diagrams as functions of non-local differential operators applied to contact Witten diagrams. In this paper, we develop the differential representation for scalar Carrollian correlators. We first construct this representation using the recently formulated Carrollian limit of AdS Witten diagrams. We then provide an alternate intrinsic analysis that leverages the properties of the Carrollian bulk-to-boundary propagator. Using the differential representation, we also obtain differential Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations for Carrollian correlators.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Particularly, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via the shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that the result matches the one obtained from shockwave analysis. Furthermore, we analyze in detail, the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent (z), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), charge (Q) and the horizon radius ($r_{h}$). We interestingly find non-monotonic behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to z (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of $\theta$, Q and $r_{h}$) and $\theta$ (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of z, Q and $r_{h}$). Moreover, $v_{B}$ is found to monotonically decrease with an increase in charge (for all permissible, fixed values of z, $\theta$ and $r_{h}$), whereas it is found to monotonically increase with $r_{h}$ (for all fixed, permissible values of z, $\theta$ and Q). Unpacking these features can offer some valuable insights into the chaotic nature of HVL theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetries in 6d from Green-Schwarz Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct non-invertible symmetries in 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal field theories that arise from Green-Schwarz (GS) automorphisms, which form abelian or non-abelian groups. Applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $S_3$ GS automorphisms, gives rise to non-invertible duality, triality and $S_3$-ality defects, respectively, once combined with stacking symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs) and gauging 2-form symmetries. We derive the defects and their fusion rules from two distinct perspectives: from half-space gauging as well as from the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This is the first concrete construction of symmetry defects in 6d forming a fusion 5-category whose fusions are intrinsically non-invertible and non-abelian.</description>

      <title>The Higher Structure of Symmetries of Axion-Maxwell Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries of quantum field theories are characterized by topological defects/operators organized into a higher category. In this paper we consider the Axion-Maxwell field theory in four dimensions and, building on the construction of its topological defects by Choi, Lam, Shao, Hidaka, Nitta and Yokokura, we discuss field theoretical methods to compute some aspects of the higher structure of such category. In particular, we determine explicitly the generalized $F$-symbols for the non-invertible electric 1-form symmetry of the theory. Along the way we clarify various aspects of the bottom-up worldvolume approach towards the calculus of defects.</description>

      <title>A physical basis for cosmological correlators from cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Perturbative gravitational wave predictions for the real-scalar extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a state-of-the-art study of the cosmological phase transitions of the real-scalar extended Standard Model. We carry out a broad scan of the parameter space of this model at next-to-next-to-leading order in powers of couplings. We use effective field theory to account for the necessary higher-order resummations, and to construct consistent real and gauge-invariant gravitational wave predictions. Our results provide a comprehensive account of the convergence of perturbative predictions for the gravitational wave signals in this model. For the majority of the parameter points in our study, we observe apparent convergence. While leading and next-to-leading order predictions of the gravitational wave amplitude typically suffer from relative errors between $10$ and $10^4$, at next-to-next-to-leading order the typical relative errors are reduced to between $0.5$ and $50$. Nevertheless, for those parameter points predicting the largest signals, potentially observable by future gravitational wave observatories, the validity of the perturbative expansion is in doubt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct static axisymmetric multisolitons in the Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This theory features a complex scalar field which gains mass through its interaction with a real scalar field that has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. By performing three-dimensional numerical relativity simulations, we identify stable dipolar boson stars in specific regions of the parameter space. Based on the dipole results, non-rotating odd parity chains with and without gravity can also be constructed when the mass of the real scalar field is sufficiently small. However, chains beyond the dipole case are found to be unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Categorical Symmetries are a powerful new tool for analyzing quantum field theories. This volume compiles lecture notes from the 2022 and 2023 summer schools on Global Categorical Symmetries, held at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and at the Swiss Map Research Station in Les Diableret. Specifically, this volume collects the lectures:
  * An introduction to symmetries in quantum field theory, Kantaro Ohmori
  * Introduction to anomalies in quantum field theory, Clay C\'ordova
  * Symmetry Categories 101, Michele Del Zotto
  * Applied Cobordism Hypothesis, David Jordan
  * Finite symmetry in QFT, Daniel S. Freed
  These volumes are devoted to interested newcomers: we only assume (basic) knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and some relevant maths. We try to give appropriate references for non-standard materials that are not covered. Our aim in this first volume is to illustrate some of the main questions and ideas together with some of the methods and the techniques necessary to begin exploring global categorical symmetries of QFTs.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD Critical End Point with Finite-Size Scaling of Net-Baryon Cumulant Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central focus in heavy-ion physics, as it provides insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. Finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to explore the critical behavior of cumulant ratios \( C_2/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), \( C_4/C_2 \), \( C_3/C_1 \), and \( C_4/C_1 \), measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of 7.7 to 200 GeV. The scaling functions for these ratios reveal non-monotonic patterns near the CEP, where critical fluctuations appear in distinct scaling behavior. A consistent scaling pattern emerges at \(\sqrt{s}_{\text{CEP}} = 31.0 \, \text{GeV}\), corresponding to \( \mu_{B,\text{CEP}} \approx 134.3 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( T_{\text{CEP}} \approx 155 \, \text{MeV}\), derived from the freeze-out curve. The FSS analysis shows upward divergence of \( C_2/C_1 \) and \( C_4/C_1 \), and downward divergence of \( C_3/C_2 \) and \( C_4/C_2 \), consistent with theoretical expectations for critical dynamics. These findings validate the robustness of these cumulant ratios as probes for the CEP, offering structured evidence for critical behavior in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, Birkhoff's theorem asserts that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution must be static and asymptotically flat. In this paper, we study the validity of Birkhoff's theorem for a broad class of modified gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions, including quadratic and higher-order gravity models. We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild spacetime remains the unique Einstein branch solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration of these theories. Consequently, unlike black holes, the breakdown of junction conditions at the surface of the star further implies that the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in these modified theories cannot simultaneously be spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch. This insight offers a unique observational probe for theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A\"inou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a $R=0$ spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features {\em vis-a-vis} the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.</description>

Abstract: We identify a new critical parameter in Choptuik's gravitational collapse: the angle at which null energy condition (NEC) saturation lines intersect at the center of the critical spacetime. These NEC lines coincide with regions of vanishing curvature, dividing spacetime into stripes of positive and negative curvature. By numerically solving Choptuik's original system we find the NEC angle to be $\alpha\approx0.64$ ($\approx37^\circ$) and analytically derive $\alpha=2$arccot$(D-1)$ for any spacetime dimension $D&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Statistics and Complexity of Wavefunction Spreading in Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the statistics of the results of a measurement of the spreading operator in the Krylov basis generated by the Hamiltonian of a quantum system starting from a specified initial pure state. We first obtain the probability distribution of the results of measurements of this spreading operator at a certain instant of time, and compute the characteristic function of this distribution. We show that the moments of this characteristic function are related to the so-called generalised spread complexities, and obtain expressions for them in several cases when the Hamiltonian is an element of a Lie algebra. Furthermore, by considering a continuum limit of the Krylov basis, we show that the generalised spread complexities of higher orders have a peak in the time evolution for a random matrix Hamiltonian belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble. We also obtain an upper bound in the change in generalised spread complexity at an arbitrary time in terms of the operator norm of the Hamiltonian and discuss the significance of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge and the choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black hole let us suspect that similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model is proposed, where the Higgs field is valued in the complex projective plane ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, rather than ${\mathbb{C}}^2$. Its geometry is consistent with $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry. The leading terms in the Lagrangian, beyond those of the Standard Model, are much more tightly constrained than in general SMEFTs, and the $SO(4)$ residual symmetry of the Higgs sector is mildly broken.</description>

Abstract: A Skyrme type energy functional for maps $\varphi$ from an oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $M$ to a contact 3-manifold $N$ is defined, generalizing the BPS Skyrme energy of Ferreira and Zakrzewski. This energy has a topological lower bound, attained by solutions of a first order self-duality equation which we call (strong) Beltrami maps. In the case where $N$ is the 3-sphere, we show that the original Ferreira-Zakrzewski model (which has $N=S^3$ with the standard contact structure) can have no BPS solutions on $M=S^3$ with $|\mathrm{deg}(\varphi)|&gt;1$ if the coupling constant has the lowest admissible value.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Black Holes: Assessing Resummation Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in post-Minkowksian (PM) calculations have led to a fast-growing body of weak-field perturbative information. As such, there is major interest within the gravitational wave community as to how this information can be used to improve the accuracy of theoretical waveform models. In this work, we build on recent efforts to validate high-order PM calculations using numerical relativity simulations. We present a new set of high-energy scattering simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes, further expanding the existing suite of NR simulations. We outline the basic features of three recently proposed resummation schemes (the $\mathscr{L}$-resummed model, the $w^\mathrm{eob}$ model and the SEOB-PM model) and compare the analytical predictions to our NR data. Each model is shown to demonstrate pathological behaviour at high energies, with common features such as PM hierarchical shifts and divergences. The NR data can also be used to calibrate pseudo-5PM corrections to the scattering angle or EOB radial potentials. In each case, we argue that including higher-order information improves the agreement between the analytical models and NR, though the extent of improvement depends on how this information is incorporated and the choice of analytical baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that further resummation of the EOB radial potentials could be an effective strategy to improving the model agreement.</description>

      <title>Reggeization in Color</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the high energy limit, $s\gg -t$, amplitudes in planar gauge theories Reggeize, with power law behavior $\big( \frac{s}{-t} \big)^{\alpha(t)}$ governed by the Regge trajectory $\alpha(t)$. Beyond the planar limit this simplicity is violated by "Regge cuts", for which practical organizational principles are still being developed. We use a top-down effective field theory organization based on color projection in the $t$ channel and rapidity evolution equations for collinear impact factors, to sum large $s\gg -t$ logarithms for Regge cut contributions. The results are matrix equations which are closed within a given color channel. To illustrate the method we derive in QCD with $SU(N_c)$ for the first time a closed 6$\times$6 evolution equation for the "decupletons" in the $\text{10}\oplus\overline{\text{10}}$ Regge color channel, a 2$\times$2 evolution equation for the "triantapentons" in the $\text{35}\oplus\overline{\text{35}}$ color channel, and a scalar evolution equation for the "tetrahexaconton" in the 64 color channel. More broadly, our approach allows us to describe generic Reggeization phenomena in non-planar gauge theories, providing valuable data for the all loop structure of amplitudes beyond the planar limit.</description>

      <title>Subregion-subalgebra duality: emergence of space and time in holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holographic duality, a higher dimensional quantum gravity system emerges from a lower dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with a large number of degrees of freedom. We propose a formulation of duality for a general causally complete bulk spacetime region, called subregion-subalgebra duality, which provides a framework to describe how geometric notions in the gravity system, such as spacetime subregions, different notions of times, and causal structure, emerge from the dual CFT. Subregion-subalgebra duality generalizes and brings new insights into subregion-subregion duality (or equivalently entanglement wedge reconstruction). It provides a mathematically precise definition of subregion-subregion duality and gives an independent definition of entanglement wedges without using entropy. Geometric properties of entanglement wedges, including those that play a crucial role in interpreting the bulk as a quantum error correcting code, can be understood from the duality as the geometrization of the superadditivity of certain algebras. Using general boundary subalgebras rather than those associated with geometric subregions makes it possible to find duals for general bulk spacetime regions, including those not touching the boundary. Applying subregion-subalgebra duality to a boundary state describing a single-sided black hole also provides a precise way to define mirror operators.</description>

Abstract: The theory of symplectic scalar fermion of LeClair and Neubert is studied. The theory evades the conventional spin-statistics theorem because its Hamiltonian is pseudo Hermitian. Here, we clarify the derivation of the symplectic currents and charges. By demanding the currents and charges to be pseudo Hermitian, the global symmetry of the free Lagrangian density reduces from Sp(2,C) to SU(2). By explicit calculations, we show that the LeClair-Neubert model of N quartic self-interacting scalar fermions admits generalized unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>SUSY QED with Lorentz-asymmetric fermionic matter and a glance at the electron's EDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution sets out to pursue the investigation of a supersymmetric electrodynamics model with Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) manifested by a space-time unbalance in the propagation of the fermionic charged matter. Despite violation of Lorentz symmetry, the supersymmetry algebra is kept untouched. A superspace approach is then adopted to build up an $\mathcal{N}=1$-supersymmetric Abelian gauge theory in presence of a Lorentz-violating background supermultiplet that accommodates the space-time asymmetry parameter of the charged matter. It is described, in this scenario, how the particular Lorentz-symmetry breaking, brought about by the fermionic matter, affects its (matter) scalar partners and the photon/photino that minimally couple to charged matter. From the (modified) Dirac, Klein-Gordon and Maxwell field equations, the corresponding dispersion relations are worked out to inspect and discuss the physical effects of the LSV Majorana fermion condensates that naturally emerge from the background supermultiplet. Finally, efforts are targeted to investigate the Gordon decomposition of the charged lepton electromagnetic current. This is carried out by iterating the (fermion and scalar) matter field equations, which points to an effective contribution to the electron's electric dipole moment. This result allows us to attain an estimate of the pseudo-vector condensate of the (LSV) Majorana background fermion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Not all complete set of spinors can be used as expansion coefficients of a quantum field. In fact, Steven Weinberg established the uniqueness of Dirac spinors for this purpose provided: (a) one paid due attention to the multiplicative phases for each of the spinors, and (b) one paired these to creation and annihilation operators in a specific manner. This is implicit in his implementation of the rotational symmetry for the spin half quantum field. Among the numerous complete set of spinors that are available to a physicist, Elko occupies a unique status that allows it to enter as expansion coefficients of a quantum field without violating Weinberg's no go theorem. How this paradigm changing claim arises is the primary subject of this communication. Weinberg's no go theorem is evaded by exploiting a uniquely special feature of Elko that allows us to introduce a doubling of the particle-antiparticle degrees of freedom from four to eight. Weinberg had dismissed this degeneracy on the ground that, "no examples are known of particles that furnish unconventional representations of inversions." Here we will find that this degeneracy, once envisioned by Eugene Wigner, in fact gives rise to a quantum field that has all the theoretical properties required of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: In the Lounesto classification, there are three types of regular spinors. They are classified by the condition that at least one of the scalar or pseudo scalar norms are non-vanishing. The Dirac spinors are regular spinors because their scalar and pseudo scalar norms are non-zero and zero respectively. We construct local and Lorentz-covariant fermionic fields from all three classes of regular spinors. By computing the invariants and bilinear covariants of the regular spinor fields, we show that they are physically equivalent to the Dirac fields in the sense that whatever interactions one writes down using the regular spinor fields, they can always be expressed in terms of the Dirac fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization flow of generic actions that depend on the invariants of the field strength tensor of an abelian gauge field. While the Maxwell action defines a Gaussian fixed point, we search for further non-Gaussian fixed points or rather fixed functions, i.e., globally existing Lagrangians of the invariants. Using standard small-field expansion techniques for the resulting functional flow equation, a large number of fixed points is obtained, which - in analogy to recent findings for a shift-symmetric scalar field - we consider as approximation artifacts. For the construction of a globally existing fixed function, we pay attention to the use of proper initial conditions. Parametrizing the latter by the photon anomalous dimension, both the coefficients of the weak-field expansion are fully determined and those of the large-field expansion can be matched such that a global fixed function can be constructed for magnetic fields. The anomalous dimension also governs the strong-field limit. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a continuum of non-Gaussian fixed points parametrized by a small positive anomalous dimension below a critical value. We discuss the implications of this result within various scenarios with and without additional matter. For the strong-field limit of the 1PI QED effective action, where the anomalous dimension is determined by electronic fluctuations, our result suggests the existence of a singularity free strong-field limit, circumventing the standard conclusions connected to the perturbative Landau pole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a cutoff scale of quantum gravity, the species scale can be defined by the scale at which the perturbativity of the non-renormalizable gravitational interaction begins to break down. Since it is determined by the number of species in the effective field theory, we can find the close connection to the distance conjecture, which predicts the lowering of the cutoff at the asymptotic limit of the moduli space caused by the descent of a tower of states from UV. Meanwhile, the same kind of the cutoff scale can be obtained from any non-renormalizable interaction, in particular the interaction between the axion and the gauge field through the $\theta F\wedge F$ term. Demanding this `axion species scale' not to exceed the gravitational species scale, we obtain the bound $(8\pi^2/g^2)f \lesssim M_{\rm Pl}$. This is quite similar to the axion weak gravity conjecture bound, but can be applied to any gauge as well as the string interactions which are relevant to towers of states. We also investigate the implications of the (axion) species scale and the axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound by considering the Peccei-Quinn charge reduction of black hole through the interaction between black hole and the string or wormhole.</description>

Abstract: When spacetime is considered as a subspace of a wider complex spacetime manifold, there is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups, the real and complex Poincar\'{e} groups. In particular, no spinors are allowed for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on principal bundles in complex spacetime, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure analogous to the one of the standard model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Defects with Degrees of Freedom in Free Scalar CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories are interesting objects to study from both formal and applied points of view. In this paper, we construct conformal defects in free scalar field CFTs in diverse dimensions. After discussing the possible quadratic defects, we explore interacting setups. These are realized by coupling the bulk free scalar to lower-dimensional theories, including the unitary family of minimal models $\mathcal{M}(p, p+1)$. Another example involves coupling to a two-dimensional free scalar field, from which we construct surface defects for the bulk dimensions three and five. Additionally, we consider monodromy defects associated with a global $U(1)$ flavour symmetry. In these theories, we study both self-defect interactions and couplings to Minimal Models, finding new IR defect fixed points. For all our examples, we provide results for correlation functions, such as those involving the bulk stress tensor and the displacement operator, and for the defect central charges.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD, in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-type theory and in softly broken ${\cal N}=2\rightarrow {\cal N}=1$ SQCD. And problems with the ${\cal N}=1$ Seiberg duality</title>

Abstract: Mass spectra are calculated for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD and SQCD-type theories and for softly broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD in vacua with unbroken $Z_{(2N_c-N_F)\geq 2}$ symmetry. It is shown that the Seiberg ${\cal N}=1$ duality works, at best, for massless quarks within the conformal window only.
  Besides: a) the gauge invariant order parameter for scalar quarks is introduced which distinguishes confinement and higgs phases, b) the phase transition are described in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-type and broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD theories between confinement and higgs phases, c) the confinement mechanism is proposed for the ordinary YM and ${\cal N}=1$ SYM theories.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU$(N$) ${\cal N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theories with conformal matter in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$. These operators are special examples of loops consisting of two meridians on the two-sphere separated by an arbitrary opening angle. We conjecture an exact expression for the observable based on Pestun's matrix model and show that it perfectly reproduces the perturbative calculations at three loops in the theories under examination and at four loops in special setups characterized by hypermultiplets in the (rank-2) symmetric and antisymmetric representation of the gauge group. Moreover, we show that our conjecture is consistent with the known expression for the Bremsstrahlung function of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories. Finally, exploiting the matrix model representation of these Wilson loops, we study the large-$N$ limit at strong coupling of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal QCD, finding a surprising transition in the vacuum expectation value for a critical opening angle.</description>

      <title>Diving into a multi-band holographic superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the interior structure of a multi-band holographic superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. With two s-wave order parameters, the boundary system has more interesting behaviors which can also be reflected in black hole interior structure. We find the Einstein-Rosen bridge collapse and Josephson oscillations of two scalar fields inside the horizon. For the region near the singularity, we find that the metric still presents Kasner form and there is also Kasner transition behavior. However, when two scalar fields coexist, the Kasner exponents and Kasner transition formula will be different from the single scalar field case. The different interior structures between multi-band holographic superconductor and single-band holographic superconductor we find in this work further confirms that the black hole interior is important to reflect the properties of dual condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper begins with a brief survey of the period prior to and soon after the creation of the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOAs). This survey is intended to highlight some of the important developments leading to the creation of VOA theory. The paper then proceeds to describe progress made in the field of VOAs in the last 15 years which is based on fruitful analogies and connections between VOAs and commutative algebras. First, there are several functors from VOAs to commutative algebras that allow methods from commutative algebra to be used to solve VOA problems. To illustrate this, we present a method for describing orbifolds and cosets using methods of classical invariant theory. This was essential in the recent solution of a conjecture of Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak that is of current interest in physics. We also recast some old conjectures in the subject in terms of commutative algebra and give some generalizations of these conjectures. We also give an overview of the theory of topological VOAs (TVOAs), with applications to BRST cohomology theory and conformal string theory, based on work in the 90's. We construct a functor from TVOAs to Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras -- supercommutative algebras equipped with a certain odd Poisson structure realized by a second order differential operator -- and present a number of interesting applications. This paper is based in part on the lecture given by the first author at the Harvard CMSA Math-Science Literature Lecture Series on May 22, 2020.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes induced by Stress Energy Conservation: combining Casimir Energy with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate possible manifolds characterizing traversable wormholes in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, which has both kinetic and potential energy. The feature of traversability requires the violation of the null energy condition, which, in turn, signals the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density. To achieve this, we introduce a hypothetical Casimir apparatus with plates positioned either at a parametrically fixed or radially varying distance. A consistent set of field equations requires the introduction of an auxiliary field composed solely of pressure terms, which we interpret as the gravitational back-reaction of the traversable wormhole to the original source. Interestingly, the only case that appears to avoid the need for such an auxiliary field involves a scalar field with potential energy, combined with a Casimir device with fixed plates.</description>

      <title>Gapless non-hydrodynamic modes in relativistic kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide rigorous criteria to determine whether the non-hydrodynamic sector of a relativistic kinetic theory is gapless. These general criteria apply to both Boltzmann's equation and approximate models thereof, provided that the latter are consistent with thermodynamic principles. As an application of these criteria, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless whenever the scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. Physically, this happens because, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this paper is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in our recent paper [T. Koide and F. Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper [1] suggested that a gravitational wave generated by flyby would merely displace the particles. We confirm their prediction numerically by fine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then analytically for its approximation by a P\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We have calculated the one-loop scattering amplitude of an electron by an external Coulomb potential in QED free of infrared divergences. This feature is achieved by applying the Faddeev-Kulish formalism, which implies a redefinition of both the asymptotic electronic states and of the $S$ matrix. Additionally, we have also derived the infrared-finite one-loop partial-wave amplitudes for this process by applying a recent method in the literature. Next, these partial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by employing three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method, the Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have studied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones to look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound state in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail. This is a wide-ranging method for calculating nonperturbative partial-wave amplitudes for infinite-range interactions that could be applied to many other systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Quantum Gravity: Black Holes Evaporating into Macroscopic Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, metrics that describe regular black holes, extreme black holes, or traversable wormholes have been widely discussed. These spacetimes, appearing in scenarios such as the brane world, are contingent on the values of the parameters, with each metric encompassing all three objects. We are considering various known models for these black hole/wormhole interpolating spacetimes and showing that, starting from the macroscopic black holes, all of them must evaporate into macroscopic wormholes, thus avoiding existential problems related to the final stages of black hole evaporation and issues of quantum gravity and black hole remnants. For this purpose, we are calculating the energy emission rates of black holes and the appropriate lifetimes. We argue that some of our conclusions should hold regardless of the specific model, as long as it permits an extremal black hole state with zero temperature at a particular value of the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Horndeski gravity and the ultra slowly evaporating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evaporation behaviors of asymptotically flat charged black holes in the Einstein-Horndeski gravity theory. Based on the thermodynamics of the Horndeski black hole, we present a physical understanding of the scalar charge of the Horndeski black hole and also clarify its connection to the Einstein vector theory. As the presence of non-minimal coupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly different from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case. Due to the different spacetime and electric field structures, the evaporation rate of the Horndeski black hole will slow down at the late stage of evaporation and thus gain a lifetime much longer than the RN black hole. These results illuminate the effect of non-minimally coupled matters on the black hole evaporation and provide clues to search for these matter fields in future observations.</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: chances and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>
