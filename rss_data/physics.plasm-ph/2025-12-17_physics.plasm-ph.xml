      <title>Diagnosing symplecticity in simulations of high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrals of the Liouville $1$-form, known as the first Poincar\'e integral invariant, provide a computable figure of merit for monitoring the conservation of symplecticity in the numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems. These integrals may be approximated with spectral convergence in the number of sample points, limited only by the regularity of the Hamiltonian. We devise a numerical integral invariant diagnostic for checking preservation of symplecticity in particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic plasma simulation codes. As a first application of this diagnostic tool, we check the preservation of symplecticity in symplectic electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Surprisingly, such PIC methods fail to have symplectic time-advance maps if the charge is interpolated to the grid using linear shape functions, as is commonly done in practice. It is found that at least quadratic interpolation is needed for a structure-preserving PIC method to truly be symplectic.</description>

      <title>Influence of ion motion in a resonantly driven wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several different schemes for plasma wakefield acceleration using a train of drivers have been pursued, based on the resonant excitation of a plasma wave. Since these schemes rely on the plasma electron wave surviving for many periods, the motion of the plasma ions can have a significant impact on the beam--plasma interaction. In this work, simulations are used to study the impact of this ion motion on the development of the self-modulation of a long beam, directly applicable to recent experiments. It is shown that two related but distinct effects contribute to the suppression of the wakefield excitation: the loss of resonance between the drive beam and the plasma wave it excites, and phase mixing due to transverse wavebreaking. Although only the latter has previously been investigated, we show that the two effects follow the same scaling with ion mass.</description>

      <title>Generalized relativistic second order magnetohydrodynamics: A correlation function approach using Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Electron Heating in Electron-Only Reconnection in a Laboratory Mini-Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of electron heating in electron-only magnetic reconnection in laser-driven laboratory mini-magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.</description>

      <title>Microbubble implosions in finite hollow spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microbubble implosion (MBI) is a recently proposed novel mechanism with many interesting and exciting potential applications. MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an electron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code. The simulation demonstrates that MBI occurs even for finite spheres, and high-density compression is still achievable with this setup. It also shows the optimal target structure, which maximizes ion flashing.</description>

      <title>Positron Bunch Radiation in the System of Tightly Packed Nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.08282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation emitted by a bunch of positrons channeled in nanotubes at zero emission angle is studied taking into account medium polarization. The formation of radiation is characterized by an energy threshold that depends on the oscillation amplitude of each positron. When the bunch energy reaches the maximum value of the threshold energy, radiation is produced by all positrons in the bunch. The nanotube potential barrier is described using a harmonic model. The spectral line shape of the radiation from the positron bunch, the fundamental radiation frequency, and the number of emitted photons are determined. It is shown that a system of tightly packed carbon nanotubes can generate an intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed beam of circularly polarized soft X-ray photons with an energy of about $3$~\SI{}{\kilo\electronvolt} (wavelength $4.1$~\SI{}{\angstrom}).</description>

      <title>Direct Forcing of the Collisional Auroral Ionosphere by Kinetic Alfv\'en Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of the auroral ionosphere is ascribed to local plasma instabilities. However, we report turbulence extending below 90 km altitude, where particle collisions act to stabilize the plasma. Using a composite radar-GPS spectrum, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade in the 80 km-120 km altitude layer. We identify a characteristic kinetic Alfv\'enic k^{-8/3} scaling, spanning four orders of magnitude in k, that tracks precipitating energy flux. This reveals a chemical and electric imprint of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, seeding and driving local instability processes.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration up to the synchrotron burn-off limit in relativistic magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\sigma \approx 1 $ and amplitude $\delta B/B_0\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}\gamma\propto \gamma^{-s}$ with $s\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\delta u_E \gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.
