      <title>On scheduling coupled tasks with exact delays to minimize maximum lateness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies scheduling coupled tasks with exact delays to minimize maximum lateness. The first task has processing time $p&gt;0$ and the second $b_i\geq 0$, also the second needs to start exactly $p$ units of time after the completion of the first. The couple has due date $d_i$. The tasks are scheduled on a single machine to minimize maximum lateness. The problem has been left open in the literature which offer hardly any results on scheduling coupled tasks with exact delays to minimize maximum lateness. The paper shows polynomial time algorithms for \emph{agreeable} ($d_i\geq d_j$ implies $b_i\geq b_j$) and \emph{disagreeable} ($d_i\geq d_j$ implies $b_i\leq b_j$) cases. The complexity of the general problem remains open.</description>

      <title>Schemes of Propagation Models and Source Estimators for Rumor Source Detection in Online Social Networks: A Short Survey of a Decade of Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen various rumor diffusion models being assumed in detection of rumor source research of the online social network. Diffusion model is arguably considered as a very important and challengeable factor for source detection in networks but it is less studied. This paper provides an overview of three representative schemes of Independent Cascade-based, Epidemic-based, and Learning-based to model the patterns of rumor propagation as well as three major schemes of estimators for rumor sources since its inception a decade ago.</description>

      <title>One Color Makes All the Difference in the Tractability of Partial Coloring in Semi-Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semi-streaming complexity of \textit{$k$-partial coloring}, a generalization of proper graph coloring. For $k \geq 1$, a $k$-partial coloring requires that each vertex $v$ in an $n$-node graph is assigned a color such that at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ of its neighbors are assigned colors different from its own. This framework naturally extends classical coloring problems: specifically, $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring and $k$-partial $k$-coloring generalize $(\Delta+1)$-proper coloring and $\Delta$-proper coloring, respectively.
  Prior works of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna [SODA~2019] and Assadi, Kumar, and Mittal [TheoretiCS~2023] show that both $(\Delta+1)$-proper coloring and $\Delta$-proper coloring admit one-pass randomized semi-streaming algorithms. We explore whether these efficiency gains extend to their partial coloring generalizations and reveal a sharp computational threshold : while $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits a one-pass randomized semi-streaming algorithm, the $k$-partial $k$-coloring remains semi-streaming intractable, effectively demonstrating a ``dichotomy of one color'' in the streaming model.</description>

      <title>Constrained graph generation: Preserving diameter and clustering coefficient simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating graphs subject to strict structural constraints is a fundamental computational challenge in network science. Simultaneously preserving interacting properties-such as the diameter and the clustering coefficient- is particularly demanding. Simple constructive algorithms often fail to locate vanishingly small sets of feasible graphs, while traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers suffer from severe ergodicity breaking. In this paper, we propose a two-step hybrid framework combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and MCMC sampling. First, we design a layered ACO heuristic to perform a guided global search, effectively locating valid graphs with prescribed diameter and clustering coefficient. Second, we use these ACO-designed graphs as structurally distinct seed states for an MCMC rewiring algorithm. We evaluate this framework across a wide range of graph edge densities and varying diameter-clustering-coefficient constraint regimes. Using the spectral distance of the normalized Laplacian to quantify structural diversity of the resulting graphs, our experiments reveal a sharp contrast between the methods. Standard MCMC samplers remain rigidly trapped in an isolated subset of feasible graphs around their initial seeds. Conversely, our hybrid ACO-MCMC approach successfully bridges disconnected configuration landscapes, generating a vastly richer and structurally diverse set of valid graphs.</description>

      <title>Placing Green Bridges Optimally for Robust Habitat Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robustly reconnecting habitats via the placement of green bridges at minimum total cost. Habitats are fragmented into patches and we seek to reconnect each habitat such that it remains connected even if any of its patches becomes unavailable. Formally, we are given an undirected graph with edge costs, a set of fixed green bridges represented as a subset of the graph's edges, a set of habitats represented as vertex subsets, and some budget. We decide whether there exists a subset of the graph's edges containing all fixed green bridges such that, for each habitat, the induced subgraph on the solution edges is 2-vertex-connected, and the total cost does not exceed the budget. We also study the 2-edge-connectivity variant, modeling the case where any single reconnecting green bridge may fail. We analyze the computational complexity of these problems, focusing on the boundary between NP-hardness and polynomial-time solvability when the maximum habitat size and maximum vertex degree are bounded by constants. We prove that for each constant maximum habitat size of at least four there exists a small constant maximum degree for which the problems are NP-hard, and complement this with polynomial-time algorithms yielding partial dichotomies for bounded habitat size and degree.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, but for $r=2$ it was estimated only to be $O(n^2)$. We apply a new approach based on the explicit basis expansion and summation of weighted rectangles, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$. We work in the multi-tape Turing machine model with non-constant-time arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of Minion Tests for PCSPs through Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework to study hierarchies of relaxations for Constraint Satisfaction Problems and their Promise variant. The idea is to split the description of a hierarchy into an algebraic part, depending on a minion capturing the "base level", and a geometric part - which we call tensorisation - inspired by multilinear algebra. We exploit the geometry of the tensor spaces arising from our construction to prove general properties of hierarchies. We identify certain classes of minions, which we call linear and conic, whose corresponding hierarchies have particularly fine features. We establish that the (combinatorial) bounded width, Sherali-Adams LP, affine IP, Sum-of-Squares SDP, and combined "LP + affine IP" hierarchies are all captured by this framework. In particular, in order to analyse the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy, we also characterise the solvability of the standard SDP relaxation through a new minion.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer using Markovian quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Perfect State Transfer (PST) is a fundamental tool of quantum communication in a network. It is not easy to achieve in practice. The original idea of PST depends on the fundamentals of the continuous-time quantum walk. A path graph with at most three vertices allows PST based on continuous-time quantum walk. Based on the Markovian quantum walk, we introduce a significantly powerful method for PST in this article. We establish PST between the extreme vertices of a path graph of arbitrary length. Moreover, any pair of symmetric vertices in a path graph allows PST under Markovian quantum walks. We extend our investigations for the cycle graphs. The cycle graphs with more than $4$ vertices do not allow the PST based on the continuous-time quantum walk. In contrast, a cycle graph with $2m$ vertices exhibits PST based on Markovian quantum walk between the vertices $j$ and $j + m$ for $j = 0, 1, \dots (m - 1)$, where $m &gt; 0$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraph conceptual modeling methods can be generalized as EDVW hypergraphs without information loss. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to the spectral theories for graphs, its formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and the hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is not well-defined. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our proposed HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of both NCut and conductance. Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective. Code of HyperClus-G is available at https://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/HyperClus-G.</description>

      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results for the case where even cycles are included.</description>

      <title>Advancing Uncertain Combinatorics through Graphization, Hyperization, and Uncertainization: Fuzzy, Neutrosophic, Soft, Rough, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorics studies how discrete objects can be counted, arranged, and combined under specified rules. Motivated by uncertainty in real-world data and decisions, modern set-theoretic formalisms such as fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets have been developed. In particular, neutrosophic sets model uncertainty by assigning to each element degrees of truth, indeterminacy, and falsity. In parallel, these uncertainty frameworks are increasingly investigated in graphized and hyperized forms, where generalized graph models encompass classical graphs, hypergraphs, and higher-order "superhyper" structures; related hyper- and superhyper-concepts also arise beyond graph theory.
  This book (Edition 2.0) surveys and consolidates recent developments at the intersection of combinatorics, uncertain sets, uncertain graphs, and hyper/superhyper frameworks, while introducing several new graph and set concepts. As representative contributions, we extend graph-theoretic notions via Neutrosophic Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard Real Set. The second edition adds newly introduced concepts, corrects typographical issues, and re-examines mathematical consistency, aiming to serve as a compact reference and a source of inspiration for further research.</description>

      <title>GraphOmni: A Comprehensive and Extensible Benchmark Framework for Large Language Models on Graph-theoretic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces GraphOmni, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on graph-theoretic tasks articulated in natural language. GraphOmni encompasses diverse graph types, serialization formats, and prompting schemes, significantly exceeding prior efforts in both scope and depth. Through extensive systematic evaluation, we identify critical interactions among these dimensions, demonstrating their substantial impact on model performance. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.5 and o4-mini consistently outperform other models, yet even these leading models exhibit substantial room for improvement. Performance variability is evident depending on the specific combinations of factors we considered, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive evaluations across these interconnected dimensions. Additionally, we observe distinct impacts of serialization and prompting strategies between open-source and closed-source models, encouraging the development of tailored approaches. Motivated by the findings, we also propose a reinforcement learning-inspired framework that adaptively selects the optimal factors influencing LLM reasoning capabilities. This flexible and extendable benchmark not only deepens our understanding of LLM performance on structured tasks but also provides a robust foundation for advancing research in LLM-based graph reasoning. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/GAI-Community/GraphOmni.</description>

Abstract: For a bridgeless cubic graph $G$, $m_3(G)$ is the ratio of the maximum number of edges of $G$ covered by the union of $3$ perfect matchings to $|E(G)|$. We prove that for any $r\in [4/5, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cubic graphs $G$ such that $m_3(G) = r$. For any $r\in [9/10, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cyclically $4$-connected cubic graphs $G$ with $m_3(G) = r$.</description>
