      <title>Scattered Data Histopolation in Averaging Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel-based methods offer a powerful and flexible mathematical framework for addressing histopolation problems. In histopolation, the available input data does not consist of pointwise function samples but of averages taken over intervals or higher-dimensional regions, and these mean values serve as a basis for reconstructing or approximating the target function. While classical interpolation requires continuity of the underlying function, histopolation can be performed in larger function spaces. In the framework of kernel methods, we will introduce and study the so-called averaging kernel Hilbert spaces (AKHS's) for this purpose. Within this setting, we develop systematic construction principles for averaging kernels and provide characterizations based on the Fourier-Plancherel transform. In addition, we analyze several representative histopolation scenarios in order to highlight properties of this approximation method, including conditions for unisolvence and possible error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments that shed some light on the convergence behavior of the presented approach and demonstrate its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Operator learning for models of tear film breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tear film (TF) breakup is a key driver of understanding dry eye disease, yet estimating TF thickness and osmolarity from fluorescence (FL) imaging typically requires solving computationally expensive inverse problems. We propose an operator learning framework that replaces traditional inverse solvers with neural operators trained on simulated TF dynamics. This approach offers a scalable path toward rapid, data-driven analysis of tear film dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Penalization Method for the Single-species Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck (RFP) equation describes Coulomb collisional dynamics within and across species in plasmas. It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples.</description>

      <title>Reliable eigenspace error estimation using source error estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for repurposing error estimators for source problems to compute an estimator for the gap between eigenspaces and their discretizations. Of interest are eigenspaces of finite clusters of eigenvalues of unbounded nonselfadjoint linear operators with compact resolvent. Eigenspaces and eigenvalues of rational functions of such operators are studied as a first step. Under an assumption of convergence of resolvent approximations in the operator norm and an assumption on global reliability of source problem error estimators, we show that the gap in eigenspace approximations can be bounded by a globally reliable and computable error estimator. Also included are applications of the theoretical framework to first-order system least squares (FOSLS) discretizations and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) discretizations, both yielding new estimators for the error gap. Numerical experiments with a selfadjoint model problem and with a leaky nonselfadjoint waveguide eigenproblem show that adaptive algorithms using the new estimators give refinement patterns that target the cluster as a whole instead of individual eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of spatiotemporal high-index saddle dynamics for finding multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous numerical framework for computing multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic problems by spatiotemporal high-index saddle dynamics (HiSD), which extends the traditional HiSD to the continuous-in-space setting, explicitly incorporating spatial differential operators. To enforce the Stiefel manifold constraint without introducing the analytical complications of retraction-based updates, we design a fully discrete retraction-free orthonormality-preserving scheme for spatiotemporal HiSD. This scheme exhibits favorable structural properties that substantially reduce the difficulties arising from coupling and gradient nonlinearities in spatiotemporal HiSD. Exploiting these properties, we establish gradient stability and error estimates, which consequently ensure the preservation of the Morse index for the computed saddle points. The framework is further extended to the semilinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in finding multiple solutions and constructing the solution landscape of semilinear elliptic problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first rigorous full space--time accuracy analysis of the HiSD system. It reveals intrinsic connections between saddle-search algorithms and numerical methods for PDEs, enhancing their mutual compatibility for a broad range of problems.</description>

      <title>Second-Generation Wavelet-inspired Tensor Product with Applications in Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $w$-product, a novel wavelet-based tensor multiplication scheme leveraging second-generation wavelet transforms to achieve linear transformation complexity while preserving essential algebraic properties. The $w$-product outperforms existing tensor multiplication approaches by enabling fast and numerically stable tensor decompositions by proposing ``$w$-svd'' and its sparse variant ``sp-$w$-svd'', for efficient low-rank approximations with significantly reduced computational costs. Experiments on low-rank hyperspectral image reconstruction demonstrate up to a $92.21$ times speedup compared to state-of-the-art ``$t$-svd'', with comparable PSNR and SSIM metrics. We discuss the Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors based on the $w$-product and examine its essential properties. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results. Then, hyperspectral image deblurring experiments demonstrate up to $27.88$ times speedup with improved image quality. In particular, the $w$-product and the sp-$w$-product exhibit exponentially increasing acceleration with the decomposition level compared to the traditional approach of the $t$-product. This work provides a scalable framework for multidimensional data analysis, with future research directions including adaptive wavelet designs, higher-order tensor extensions, and real-time implementations.</description>

      <title>A multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is found that the wave functions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) often vary significantly in different spatial regions, with some components exhibiting sharp variations while others remain smooth. Solving the GPE on a single mesh, even with adaptive refinement, can lead to excessive computational costs due to the need to accommodate the most oscillatory solution. To address this issue, we present a multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the GPE. To this end, we first convert it into a time-dependent equation through the imaginary time propagation method. Then the equation is discretized by the backward Euler method temporally and the multi-mesh adaptive finite element method spatially. The proposed method is compared with the single-mesh adaptive method through a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the multi-mesh adaptive method can achieve the same numerical accuracy with less computational consumption.</description>

      <title>A whole-brain model of amyloid beta accumulation and cerebral hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the "two-hit vascular hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.</description>

      <title>A Structure Preserving Finite Volume Scheme for the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-discrete finite volume scheme for the local NavierStokes-Korteweg and Euler-Korteweg systems. Our scheme is applicable for equidistant Cartesian meshes in one and two space dimensions. In contrast to other works, which employ, for example, hyperbolic approximations of the equations or auxiliary-variable approaches leading to extended systems, our scheme operates directly on the original system. We prove that it conserves mass and momentum and is energy stable. Numerical experiments complement our theoretical findings, showing that the scheme is convergent of order one if employed with explicit or implicit time discretisation.</description>

      <title>Sampling via Stochastic Interpolants by Langevin-based Velocity and Initialization Estimation in Flow ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann densities based on a probability-flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived from linear stochastic interpolants. The key innovation of our approach is the use of a sequence of Langevin samplers to enable efficient simulation of the flow. Specifically, these Langevin samplers are employed (i) to generate samples from the interpolant distribution at intermediate times and (ii) to construct, starting from these intermediate times, a robust estimator of the velocity field governing the flow ODE. For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the condition number for the generalized inverse C^{\ddag}_A. We first present the explicit expression of normwise mixed and componentwise condition numbers. Then, we derive the explicit expression of normwise condition number without Kronecker product using the classical method for condition numbers. With the intermediate result, i.e., the derivative of C^{\ddag}_A, we can recover the explicit expressions of condition numbers for solution of Indefinite least squares problem with equality constraint. To estimate these condition numbers with high reliability, we choose the probabilistic spectral norm estimator and the small-sample statistical condition estimation method and devise three algorithms. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the obtained results</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery on classes defined by integral operators and sparse approximation with adaptive dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to develop the following general approach. We study asymptotic behavior of the errors of sampling recovery not for an individual smoothness class, how it is usually done, but for the collection of classes, which are defined by integral operators with kernels coming from a given class of functions. Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths and very recently for the entropy numbers. It turns out that the above problem is closely related to the sparse approximation problem with respect to different redundant dictionaries. Specifically, the problem of sampling recovery is connected with sparse nonlinear approximation with respect to adaptive dictionaries, which means that the dictionary depends on the function under approximation.</description>

      <title>Differentiating through Stochastic Differential Equations: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems are essential to model various phenomena in physics, finance, economics, and are also of current interest in machine learning. A central modeling task is investigating parameter sensitivity, whether tuning atmospheric coefficients, computing financial Greeks, or optimizing neural networks. These sensitivities are mathematically expressed as derivatives of an objective function with respect to parameters of interest and are rarely available analytically, necessitating numerical methods for approximating them. While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require.
  This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative. Tale 1 demonstrates differentiating through discretized SDEs, known the discretize-optimize approach, is reliable for both It\^{o} and Stratonovich calculus. Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients. Our aim is to equip readers with a clear guide on the numerical differentiation of SDEs: computing gradients correctly in both It\^{o} and Stratonovich settings, understanding when discretize-optimize and optimize-discretize agree or diverge, and developing intuition for reasoning about stochastic differentiation beyond the cases explicitly covered.</description>

      <title>Multi-Preconditioned LBFGS for Training Finite-Basis PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-preconditioned LBFGS (MP-LBFGS) algorithm is introduced for training finite-basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs). The algorithm is motivated by the nonlinear additive Schwarz method and exploits the domain-decomposition-inspired additive architecture of FBPINNs, in which local neural networks are defined on subdomains, thereby localizing the network representation. Parallel, subdomain-local quasi-Newton corrections are then constructed on the corresponding local parts of the architecture. A key feature is a novel nonlinear multi-preconditioning mechanism, in which subdomain corrections are optimally combined through the solution of a low-dimensional subspace minimization problem. Numerical experiments indicate that MP-LBFGS can improve convergence speed, as well as model accuracy over standard LBFGS while incurring lower communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis and adaptive computation of a Banach-space mixed finite element method for generalized bioconvective flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyse an adaptive fully mixed finite element method for stationary generalized bioconvective flows, where the Navier--Stokes equations with concentration-dependent viscosity are coupled with a conservation law for swimming microorganisms. The formulation introduces auxiliary variables including the trace-free velocity gradient, a symmetric pseudo-stress tensor, the concentration gradient, and a semi-advective microorganism flux, which also allows for a consistent treatment of Robin-type boundary condition. The variational problem is posed within a Banach space framework and reformulated as a fixed-point operator. Existence of solutions follows from Schauder's theorem, while uniqueness is obtained under suitable data assumptions. The discrete problem is constructed using Raviart--Thomas finite element spaces together with piecewise polynomial approximations on macroelement-structured meshes, and existence of discrete solutions is established via Brouwer's theorem. An a priori error analysis yields optimal convergence rates. We further derive a residual-based a posteriori error estimator and prove its reliability using global inf-sup conditions, Helmholtz decompositions, and suitable projection operators, while efficiency is ensured through localization techniques and bubble functions. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the theoretical results, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive refinement for singular solutions and complex geometries with inclusions, and illustrate the robustness of the method for a bioconvective benchmark with plume formation governed by an Einstein--Batchelor-type viscosity law.</description>

      <title>A survey on sampling recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of unknown functions from a finite number of samples is a fundamental challenge in pure and applied mathematics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in sampling recovery, focusing on the accuracy of various algorithms and the relationship between optimal recovery errors, nonlinear approximation, and the Kolmogorov widths of function classes. A central theme is the synergy between the theory of universal sampling discretization and Lebesgue-type inequalities for greedy algorithms. We discuss three primary algorithmic frameworks: weighted least squares and $\ell_p$ minimization, sparse approximation methods, and greedy algorithms such as the Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (WOMP) in Hilbert spaces and the Weak Tchebychev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in Banach spaces. These methods are applied to function classes defined by structural conditions, like the $A_\beta^r$ and Wiener-type classes, as well as classical Sobolev-type classes with dominated mixed derivatives. Notably, we highlight recent findings showing that nonlinear sampling recovery can provide superior error guarantees compared to linear methods for certain multivariate function classes.</description>

      <title>Coupling Deep Learning with Full Waveform Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) aims to reconstruct unknown physical coefficients in wave equations using the wavefield data generated from multiple incoming sources. In this work, we propose an offline-online computational strategy for coupling classical least-squares-based computational inversion with modern learning-based approaches for FWI to achieve advantages that can not be achieved with only one of the components. \RED{In brief, we develop an offline learning strategy to construct a robust approximation of the inverse operator through weighted optimization and utilize it to design a new objective function for approximate online inversion with new datasets. The approximate online inversion then serves as a warm start for the true online inversion.} We demonstrate through numerical simulations that our coupling strategy improves the computational efficiency of FWI with reliable offline training on moderate computational resources (in terms of both the size of the training dataset and the computational cost needed).</description>

      <title>An A Posteriori Error Estimator for Electrically Coupled Liquid Crystal Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives an a posteriori error estimator for the nonlinear first-order optimality conditions associated with the electrically and flexoelectrically coupled Frank-Oseen model of liquid crystals, building on previous results for elastic systems. The estimator is proposed for a penalty approach to imposing the unit-length constraint required by the model. Moreover, theory is proven establishing that the estimator provides a reliable estimate of global approximation error and an efficient measure of local error, suitable for use in adaptive refinement. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency with adaptive refinement guided by the proposed estimator in a multilevel, nested-iteration framework and superior physical properties for challenging electrically coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Certified Model Order Reduction for parametric Hermitian eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the efficient and certified numerical approximation of the smallest eigenvalue and the associated eigenspace of a large-scale parametric Hermitian matrix. For this aim, we rely on projection-based model order reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by projecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller dimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type strategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for source problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation error related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since the difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the so-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate, we propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues and for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR approximation of the spectral gap. Based on that, a second subspace is then generated for the MOR approximation of the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. We also provide efficiently computable conditions to ensure that the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue is fully captured in the reduced space. This work is motivated by a specific application: the repeated identifications of the states with minimal energy, the so-called ground states, of parametric quantum spin system models.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving space discretization of differential and nonlocal constitutive relations for port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure-preserving space discretization of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems defined with differential constitutive relations. Using the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a structure-preserving Finite Element Method.
  To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports naturally occur.
  Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system. Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.</description>

      <title>Neural Correction Operator: A Reliable and Fast Approach for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that reconstructs electrical conductivity mediums from boundary voltage-current measurements, but its severe ill-posedness renders direct operator learning with neural networks unreliable. We propose the neural correction operator framework, which learns the inverse map as a composition of two operators: a reconstruction operator using L-BFGS optimization with limited iterations to obtain an initial estimate from measurement data and a correction operator implemented with deep learning models to reconstruct the true media from this initial guess. We explore convolutional neural network architectures and conditional diffusion models as alternative choices for the correction operator. We evaluate the neural correction operator by comparing with L-BFGS methods as well as neural operators and conditional diffusion models that directly learn the inverse map over several benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better reconstruction quality compared to both iterative methods and direct neural operator learning methods with the same architecture. The proposed framework also exhibits robustness to measurement noise while achieving substantial computational speedup compared to conventional methods. The neural correction operator provides a general paradigm for approaching neural operator learning in severely ill-posed inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Implicit-Explicit Scheme with Multiscale Vanka Two-Grid Solver for Heterogeneous Unsaturated Poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a coupled nonlinear system of equations that describe unsaturated flow in heterogeneous poroelastic media. For the numerical solution, we use a finite element approximation in space and present an efficient multiscale two-grid solver for solving the coupled system of equations. The proposed two-grid solver contains two main parts: (i) accurate coarse grid approximation based on local spectral spaces and (ii) coupled smoothing iterations based on an overlapping multiscale Vanka method. A Vanka smoother and local spectral coarse grids come with significant computational cost in the setup phase. To avoid constructing a new solver for each time step and/or nonlinear iteration, we utilize an implicit-explicit integration scheme in time, where we partition the nonlinear operator as a sum of linear and nonlinear parts. In particular, we construct an implicit linear approximation of the stiff components that remains fixed across all time, while treating the remaining nonlinear residual explicitly. This allows us to construct a robust two-grid solver offline and utilize it for fast and efficient online time integration. A linear stability analysis of the proposed novel coupled scheme is presented based on the representation of the system as a two-step scheme. We show that the careful decomposition of linear and nonlinear parts guarantees a linearly stable scheme. A numerical study is presented for a two-dimensional nonlinear coupled test problem of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous poroelastic media. We demonstrate the robustness of the two-grid solver, particularly the efficacy of block smoothing compared with simple pointwise smoothing, and illustrate the accuracy and stability of implicit-explicit time integration.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation for the wave equation in heterogeneous media: Numerical investigation of stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity. Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far more demanding than in the homogeneous case.</description>

      <title>Numerical Error Analysis of the Poisson Equation under RHS Inaccuracies in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations rely on accurate solutions of the electrostatic Poisson equation, yet accuracy often deteriorates near irregular Dirichlet boundaries on Cartesian meshes. While much research has addressed discretization errors on the left-hand side (LHS) of the Poisson equation, the impact of right-hand-side (RHS) inaccuracies - arising from charge density sampling near boundaries in PIC methods - remains largely unexplored. This study analyzes the numerical errors induced by underestimated RHS values at near-boundary nodes when solving the Poisson equation using embedded boundary finite difference schemes with linear and quadratic treatments. Analytical derivations in one dimension and truncation error analyses in two dimensions reveal that such RHS inaccuracies modify local truncation behavior differently: they reduce the dominant truncation error in the linear scheme but introduce a zeroth-order term in the quadratic scheme, leading to larger global errors. Numerical experiments in one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains confirm these findings. Contrary to expectations, the linear scheme yields superior overall accuracy under typical PIC-induced RHS inaccuracies. A simple RHS calibration strategy is further proposed to restore the accuracy of the quadratic scheme. These results offer new insight into the interplay between boundary-induced RHS errors and discretization accuracy in Poisson-type problems.</description>

      <title>Macro-element Refinement schemes for THB-Splines: Applications to B\'ezier Projection and Structure-Preserving Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive refinement strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) using Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). The proposed strategy enhances locally-refined meshes for specific applications, simplifying implementation. We focus on two key applications: an $L^2$-stable local projector for THB-splines via B\'ezier projection [Dijkstra and Toshniwal (2023)], and structure-preserving discretizations using THB-splines [Evans et al. (2020), Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024)]. Previous methods required mesh modifications to retain crucial properties like local linear independence and the exactness of discrete de Rham complexes. Our approach introduces a macro-element-based refinement technique, refining $\vec{q} = q_1\times\cdots\times q_n$ blocks of elements, termed $\vec{q}$-boxes, where the block size $\vec{q}$ is determined by the spline degree and application. For the B\'ezier projection, we refine $\vec{p}$-boxes (i.e., $\vec{q} = \vec{p}$), ensuring THB-splines are locally linearly independent in these boxes, which enables a straightforward extension of the B\'ezier projection algorithm, greatly improving upon Dijkstra and Toshniwal (2023). For structure-preserving discretizations, we refine $(\vec{p+1})$-boxes (i.e., $\vec{q} = \vec{p}+\vec{1}$), demonstrating that this choice meets the sufficient conditions for ensuring the exactness of the THB-spline de Rham complex, as outlined by Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024), in any dimension. This critical aspect allows for adaptive simulations without additional mesh modifications. The effectiveness of our framework is supported by theoretical proofs and numerical experiments, including optimal convergence for adaptive approximation and simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

Abstract: We propose one finite element method for both second order linear uniformly elliptic PDE in non-divergence form and the uniformly elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. For both linear elliptic PDE in non-divergence form and the HJB equation, we prove the well-posedness of strong solution in $W^{2,p}(\Omega)$ and optimal convergence in discrete $W^{2,p}$-norm of the finite element approximation to the strong solution for $1&lt;p\leq 2$ on convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d=2,3$). If the domain is a two dimensional non-convex polygon, $p$ is valid in a more restricted region. Furthermore, we relax the assumptions on the continuity of coefficients of the HJB equation, which have been widely used in literature.</description>

      <title>A note on the space-time variational formulation for the wave equation with source term in $L^2(Q)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a variational formulation for the scalar wave equation in the second-order formulation on bounded Lipschitz domains and homogeneous initial conditions. We investigate a variational framework in a bounded space-time cylinder $Q$ with a new solution space and the test space $L^2(Q)$ for source terms in $L^2(Q)$. Using existence and uniqueness results in $H^1(Q)$, we prove that this variational setting fits the inf-sup theory, including an isomorphism as solution operator. Moreover, we show that the new solution space is not a subspace of $H^2(Q)$. This new uniqueness and solvability result is not only crucial for discretizations using space-time methods, including least-squares approaches, but also important for regularity results and the analysis of related space-time boundary integral equations, which form the basis for space-time boundary element methods.</description>

      <title>Free-RBF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Adaptive Radial Basis Functions for Efficient Function Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.</description>
