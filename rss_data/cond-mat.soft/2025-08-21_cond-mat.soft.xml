      <title>Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14047v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>

      <title>A framework for finite-strain viscoelasticity based on rheological representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new constitutive and computational framework based on strain-like internal variables belonging to Sym(3) and two representative rheological configurations. The generalized Maxwell and generalized Kelvin-Voigt models are considered as prototypes for parallelly and serially connected rheological devices, respectively. For each configuration, distinct kinematic assumptions are introduced. The constitutive theory is derived based on thermomechanical principles, where the free energies capture recoverable elastic responses and dissipation potentials govern irreversible mechanisms. The evolution equations for the internal variables arise from the principle of maximum dissipation. A key insight is the structural distinction in the constitutive laws resulted from the two rheological architectures. In particular, the Kelvin-Voigt model leads to evolution equations with non-equilibrium processes coupled, which pose computational challenges for the constitutive integration. To address this, we exploit the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to design an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that strategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula, and the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of non-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and computational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple non-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite strain.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Emergent Self-propulsion of Skyrmionic Matter in Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propulsion plays a crucial role in biological processes and nanorobotics, enabling small systems to move autonomously in noisy environments. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a bound skyrmion-skyrmion pair in a synthetic antiferromagnetic bilayer can function as a self-propelled topological object, reaching speeds of up to a hundred million body lengths per second--far exceeding those of any known synthetic or biological self-propelled particles. The propulsion mechanism is triggered by the excitation of back-and-forth relative motion of the skyrmions, which generates nonreciprocal gyrotropic forces, driving the skyrmion pair in a direction perpendicular to their bond. Remarkably, thermal noise induces spontaneous reorientations of the pair and momentary reversals of the propulsion, mimicking behaviors observed in motile bacteria and microalgae.</description>

      <title>Lattice elasticity of blue phases in cholesteric liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New theoretical approaches have been developed for studying and quantitatively describing the elastic properties of cubic blue phases in cholesteric liquid crystals. Within the framework of the Landau-de Gennes theory, using the simplest blue phase with spatial group $O^5$ ($I432$) as an example, calculations of the bulk modulus and two shear moduli were performed depending on the chirality strength and temperature below the crystallization point from isotropic liquid. It is shown that the used approximations of rigid tensors and free helicoids give qualitatively similar results but differ noticeably quantitatively, therefore further experimental studies and numerical modeling of blue phase elasticity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Equipartition and the temperature of maximum density of TIP4/2005 water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate TIP4P/2005 water in the temperature range of 257 K to 318 K with time steps of $\delta =$ 0.25, 0.50, and 2.0 fs. Within the computed statistical uncertainties, the density-temperature behavior obtained using 0.25 fs and 0.50 fs are in excellent agreement with each other but differ from those obtained using $\delta t = 2.0$ fs, a choice that leads to a breakdown of equipartition. The temperature of maximum density (TMD) is 277.15 K with $\delta t = $0.25 fs or 0.50 fs, but is shifted to 273.15 K for simulations with $\delta t = 2.0$ fs. This shift is comparable in magnitude to the shift in TMD due to nuclear quantum effects, emphasizing the care required in the parameterization and classical statistical mechanical simulation of a fluid that displays nontrivial nuclear quantum effects under ambient conditions. Enhancing the water-water dispersion interaction, as has been recommended for modeling disordered solvated proteins, degrades the description of the liquid-vapor phase envelope.</description>

      <title>Delayed transitions, promoted states and multistability in a pressure-driven nematic under an electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effects of an applied pressure gradient on the classical Freedericksz transition, finding a delayed transition, the promotion of particular director configurations and even pressure-induced multistability. Using the theoretical framework developed by Ericksen and Leslie, we find that the applied pressure gradient adapts the normal pitchfork bifurcation at critical applied voltage, leading to both a delayed bifurcation to higher voltages and a transformation from a supercritical to a subcritical bifurcation so that within a range of voltages there are at least two possible steady states. This range of voltages grows with increasing pressure gradient and eventually includes the zero voltage state so that, for sufficiently strong flow, there are at least two steady states at zero applied voltage. For sufficiently high pressure gradients, we also find that flow-alignment can create a completely new attracting steady state, one that is unstable without flow. We provide a flow-strength-electric field parameter plane that summarises the parameter ranges for which there are multiple steady states and suggest realistic mechanisms to move between these states, as well as an analytical model for the delayed Freedericksz transition effect. The novel steady states found in this work give the possibility of director and flow hysteresis in microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Universal winding properties of chiral active motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the area swept $A(t)$ and the winding angle $\Omega(t)$ as the key observables to characterize chiral active motion. We find that the distributions of the scaled area and the scaled winding angle are described by universal scaling functions across all well-known models of active particles, parametrized by the chirality $\omega$, along with a self-propulsion speed $v_0$, and the persistence time $\tau$. In particular, we show that, at late times, the average winding angle grows logarithmically with time $\la\Omega \ra\sim(\omega\tau/2)\,\ln t$, while the average area swept has a linear temporal growth $\la A(t)\ra\simeq(\omega\tau D_{\text{eff}})\,t$, where $D_{\text{eff}}=v_0^2 \tau /[2(1+ \omega^2 \tau^2)]$ is the effective diffusion coefficient. Moreover, we find that the distribution of the scaled area $z=[A-\la A\ra]/(2D_{\text{eff}}t)$ is described by the universal scaling function $F_{\text{ch}}(z)=\text{sech}(\pi z)$. From extensive numerical evidence, we conjecture the emergence of a new universal scaling function $G_{\text{ch}}(z)=\mathcal {N}/[e^{\alpha z} + e^{-\beta z}]$ for the distribution of the scaled winding angle $z=\Omega/[\ln t]$, where the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model-dependent and $\mathcal{N}$ is the normalization constant. In the absence of chirality, i.e., $\omega=0$, the scaling function becomes $G_{\text{ch}}(z)=(\alpha/\pi)\,\mathrm{sech}(\alpha z)$.</description>
