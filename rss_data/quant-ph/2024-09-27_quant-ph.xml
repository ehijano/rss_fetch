      <title>Characterizing the set of quantum correlations in prepare-and-measure quantum chain-shaped networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchy of tests satisfied by any probability distribution $P$ that represents the quantum correlations generated in prepare-and-measure (P\&amp;M) quantum chain-shaped networks, assuming only the inner-product information of the non-orthogonal quantum states. The P\&amp;M quantum chain-shaped networks involve multiple measurement parties, each measurement party potentially having multiple sequential receivers. Specifically, we adapt the original NPA-hierarchy by incorporating a finite number of linear and positive semi-definite constraints to characterize the quantum correlations in P\&amp;M quantum chain-shaped networks. These constraints in each hierarchy are derived from sequential measurement operators and the inner-product matrix of the non-orthogonal quantum states. We apply the adapted NPA-hierarchy to tackle some quantum information tasks, including sequential quantum random access codes (QRACs) and randomness certification. First, we derive the optimal trade-off between the two sequential receivers in the $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Furthermore, we have investigated semi-device-independent randomness certification in the double violation region of $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Second, considering the presence of eavesdropper (Eve) in actual communication, we show how much global and local randomness can be certified using the optimal trade-off of $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Additionally, we quantify the amount of local and global randomness that can be certified from the complete probabilities generated by the two sequential receivers. We conclude that utilizing the complete set of probabilities certifies more local and global randomness than relying solely on the optimal trade-off relationship.</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. This is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Measurable No-signalling Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study no-signalling correlations, defined over a quadruple of second countable compact Hausdorff spaces. Using operator-valued information channels over abstract alphabets, we define the subclasses of local, quantum spatial and quantum commuting measurable no-signalling correlations. En route, we establish measurable versions of the Stinespring's Dilation Theorem. We define values of measurable non-local games of local, quantum spatial and quantum commuting type, as well as inner versions thereof, and show how the asymptotic values of a finite non-local game can be viewed as special cases of the corresponding inner values of a measurable game, canonically associated with the given finite game.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and outof-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Critical spin models from holographic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>Measuring Entanglement by Exploiting its Anti-symmetric Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in experimental quantum sciences, measuring entanglement entropy remains challenging. Through a geometric perspective, we reveal the intrinsic anti-symmetric nature of entanglement. We prove that most entanglement measures, such as von Neumann and Renyi entropies, can be expressed in terms of exterior products, which are fundamentally anti-symmetric. Leveraging this, we propose utilizing the anti-symmetric nature of fermions to measure entanglement entropy efficiently, offering a resource-efficient approach to probing bipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps of local quantum channels in the weak-dissipation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of generic chaotic quantum many-body systems with no conservation laws, subject to weak bulk dissipation. It was recently observed [T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] that the generator of these dissipative dynamics, a quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$, retains a nonzero gap as the dissipation strength $\gamma \to 0$ if the thermodynamic limit is taken first. We use a hydrodynamic description of operator spreading in the presence of dissipation to estimate the gap of $\mathcal{E}$ as $\gamma \to 0$; to calculate the operator-size distribution of the low-lying eigenmodes of $\mathcal{E}$; and to relate the gap to the long-time decay rates of autocorrelation functions under unitary dynamics. We provide a microscopic derivation of this hydrodynamic perspective for random unitary circuits. We argue that the gap in the $\gamma \to 0$ limit can change nonanalytically as one tunes the parameters of the unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Bell inequalities in a many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proving the completeness of quantum mechanics has been a fundamental task since its foundation. After the formulation of the Bell inequalities, violated by quantum physics, it is nowadays believed that the theory is complete and non-local. While more general Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties choose at random two measurements to perform at causally-disconnected space-times, one could formulate temporal inequalities in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected parties, these extensions are compatible with local hidden-variable theories, so that no quantum nature appears in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. The chain constitutes a medium for the spreading of quantum information, which prevents the immediate signaling and thus the deterministic time evolution after the first measurement. Our result suggests that, as expected in a many-body setup, the Lieb-Robinson bound substitutes the speed of light as the fundamental limit for the spreading of information.</description>

      <title>Zeeman polaritons as a platform for probing Dicke physics in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of an ensemble of two-level atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field, described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, is an extensively studied problem in quantum optics. However, experimental efforts to explore similar physics in condensed matter typically employ bosonic matter modes (e.g., phonons, magnons, and plasmons) that are describable as simple harmonic oscillators, i.e., an infinite ladder of equally spaced energy levels. Here, we examine ultrastrong coupling between a coherent light mode and an ensemble of paramagnetic spins, a finite-multilevel system, in Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$. The electron paramagnetic resonance of Gd$^{3+}$ ions is tuned by a magnetic field into resonance with a Fabry--P\'erot cavity mode, resulting in the formation of spin--photon hybrid states, or Zeeman polaritons. We observe that the light--matter coupling strength, measured through the vacuum Rabi splitting, decreases with increasing temperature, which can be explained by the temperature-dependent population difference between the lower and higher-energy states, a trait of a finite-level system. This finding demonstrates that a spin--boson system is more compatible with the Dicke model and has advantages over boson--boson systems for pursuing experimental realizations of phenomena predicted for ultrastrongly coupled light--matter hybrids.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin squeezing with contact interactions in one- and three-dimensional easy-plane magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement in a many-particle system can enable measurement sensitivities beyond that achievable by only classical correlations. For an ensemble of spins, all-to-all interactions are known to reshape the quantum projection noise, leading to a form of entanglement known as spin squeezing. Here, we demonstrate spin squeezing with strictly short-range contact interactions. In particular, working with ultracold lithium atoms in optical lattices, we utilize superexchange interactions to realize a nearest-neighbor anisotropic Heisenberg model. We investigate the resulting quench dynamics from an initial product state in both one and three dimensions. In 1D, we observe $1.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ dB of spin squeezing in quantitative agreement with theory. However, in 3D, we observe a maximum of $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ dB of squeezing, over an order of magnitude smaller than that expected. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from the presence of a finite density of holes; both the motion of the holes as well as direct coupling between spin and density qualitatively alter the spin dynamics. Our observations point to the importance of understanding the complex interplay between motional and spin degrees of freedom in quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal energy of individual subsystems is not well defined in interacting quantum systems, leading to ambiguities in the definition of thermodynamic quantities. Applying the Schmidt basis formalism to general bipartite autonomous quantum systems, we demonstrate that the master equation describing subsystem evolution adheres to the principle of minimal dissipation. This enables to define internal energy of each subsystem in a consistent way. Moreover, by utilizing general aspects of open quantum systems, we show that this master equation is unique. We analyze heat and work for each subsystem as derived from this formalism, providing deeper insights into the thermodynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optically Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in HPHT Treated Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a point defect with unique spin and optical properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attracted much attention in the fields of quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and quantum networks. The optical properties of an NV center are crucial for all these quantum applications. However, NV centers fabricated by destructive methods such as electron irradiation or ion implantation usually exhibit poor optical coherence. In this work, we demonstrate a non-destructive method to fabricate optically coherent NV centers. High-purity single crystal diamonds are annealed under high pressure and high temperature (1700 $^{\circ}$C, 5.5 GPa), and individually resolvable NV centers with narrow PLE linewidth (&lt;100 MHz) are produced. The high-pressure condition prevents the conversion of diamond to graphite during high-temperature annealing, significantly expanding the parameter space for creating high-performance artificial defects for quantum information science. These findings deepen our understanding of NV center formation in diamond and have implications for the optimization of color centers in solids, including silicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

Abstract: Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\text{eff}} \simeq 70$ $\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\mathrm{\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error-correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of entanglement distribution over 155 km metropolitan fiber using a silicon nanophotonic chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitting an entangled state over an extended distance is crucial for the development of quantum networks. Previous demonstrations of transmitting entangled photons over long distance using satellites or fibers have use entangled photon pairs generated from bulk crystal arrangements. An alternative approach would be to generate photon pairs using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chips. Despite numerous proof-of-concept studies, no long range distribution has been achieved using this platform because of the challenge of getting sufficient off-chip brightness. We report a SOI platform that provides an off-chip entangled photon pair brightness of between 8,000 to 460,000 pairs per second. This exceeds previous reports by three orders of magnitude in brightness. The entanglement fidelity is 99.85(6)% and 97.90(3)% respectively. Measuring one photon locally, and transmitting the other over 93 km of deployed fiber (link loss of 40 dB), achieves a count rate of 132 pairs per second with an entanglement fidelity of 93.3(3)%, after solving the additional challenges of chromatic dispersion. The source can be pumped harder to enable transmission of entangled photons over 155 km of deployed fiber (link loss of 66 dB) at a rate of 0.7 pairs per second, with an entanglement fidelity of 87.6(5)%. These results demonstrate that SOI nanophotonic chips can perform competitively with bulk crystal sources and represent an important step toward building quantum networks using integrated nanophotonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Incomplete quantum oblivious transfer with perfect one-sided security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer is a fundamental cryptographic primitive which is useful for secure multiparty computation. There are several variants of oblivious transfer. We consider 1 out of 2 oblivious transfer, where a sender sends two bits of information to a receiver. The receiver only receives one of the two bits, while the sender does not know which bit the receiver has received. Perfect quantum oblivious transfer with information theoretic security is known to be impossible. We aim to find the lowest possible cheating probabilities. Bounds on cheating probabilities have been investigated for complete protocols, where if both parties follow the protocol, the bit value obtained by the receiver matches the sender bit value. We instead investigate incomplete protocols, where the receiver obtains an incorrect bit value with probability pf. We present optimal non interactive protocols where Alice bit values are encoded in four symmetric pure quantum states, and where she cannot cheat better than with a random guess. We find the protocols such that for a given pf, Bob cheating probability pr is as low as possible, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that non-interactive quantum protocols can outperform non-interactive classical protocols, and give a lower bound on Bob cheating probability in interactive quantum protocols. Importantly for optical implementations, our protocols do not require entanglement nor quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Ultradecoherence model of the measurement process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements remain as an interesting topic of research since the formulation of quantum theory. Attempts to model quantum measurements by unitary processes are prone to various foundational issues. Here, it is proposed that measurement devices can be modelled to have an open decoherence dynamics that is faster than any other relevant timescale, which is referred to as the ultradecoherence limit. In this limit, it is shown that the clicking rate of measurement devices can be derived from its underlying parameters, not only for the von Neumann ideal measurement devices but also for photon detectors in equal footing. This study offers a glimpse into the intriguing physics of measurement processes in quantum mechanics, with many aspects open for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Let the Quantum Creep In: Designing Quantum Neural Network Models by Gradually Swapping Out Classical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its multiplier effect and wide applications in multiple areas, could potentially be an important application of quantum computing. Since modern AI systems are often built on neural networks, the design of quantum neural networks becomes a key challenge in integrating quantum computing into AI. To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model. We start with a simple three-layer classical neural network without any normalisation layers or activation functions, and gradually change the classical layers to the corresponding quantum versions. We conduct numerical experiments on image classification datasets such as the MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate the change of performance brought by the systematic introduction of quantum components. Through this framework, our research sheds new light on the design of future quantum neural network models where it could be more favourable to search for methods and frameworks that harness the advantages from both the classical and quantum worlds.</description>

      <title>Magic state cultivation: growing T states as cheap as CNOT gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine ideas from Knill 1996, Jones 2016, Chamberland 2020, Gidney 2023+2024, Bombin 2024, and Hirano 2024 to efficiently prepare good $|T\rangle$ states. We call our construction "magic state cultivation" because it gradually grows the size and reliability of one state. Cultivation fits inside a surface code patch and uses roughly the same number of physical gates as a lattice surgery CNOT gate of equivalent reliability. We estimate the infidelity of cultivation (from injection to idling at distance 15) using a mix of state vector simulation, stabilizer simulation, error enumeration, and Monte Carlo sampling. Compared to prior work, cultivation uses an order of magnitude fewer qubit-rounds to reach logical error rates as low as $2 \cdot 10^{-9}$ when subjected to $10^{-3}$ uniform depolarizing circuit noise. Halving the circuit noise to $5 \cdot 10^{-4}$ improves the achievable logical error rate to $4 \cdot 10^{-11}$. Cultivation's efficiency and strong response to improvements in physical noise suggest that further magic state distillation may never be needed in practice.</description>

      <title>Digital simulation of zero-temperature spontaneous symmetry breaking in a superconducting lattice processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators are ideal platforms to investigate quantum phenomena that are inaccessible through conventional means, such as the limited resources of classical computers to address large quantum systems or due to constraints imposed by fundamental laws of nature. Here, through a digitized adiabatic evolution, we report an experimental simulation of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phase formation induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in a three-generation Cayley tree-like superconducting lattice. We develop a digital quantum annealing algorithm to mimic the system dynamics, and observe the emergence of signatures of SSB-induced phase transition through a connected correlation function. We demonstrate that the signature of phase transition from classical AFM to quantum FM happens in systems undergoing zero-temperature adiabatic evolution with only nearest-neighbor interacting systems, the shortest range of interaction possible. By harnessing properties of the bipartite Renyi entropy as an entanglement witness, we observe the formation of entangled quantum FM and AFM phases. Our results open perspectives for new advances in condensed matter physics and digitized quantum annealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Boolean algebra underlies the quantum logic as an important tool for quantum contextuality. We propose the notion \textit{atom graphs} to reveal the graph structure of partial Boolean algebra for quantum systems by proving that (i) the partial Boolean algebras for quantum systems are determined by their atom graphs; (ii) the states on atom graphs can be extended uniquely to the partial Boolean algebras, and (iii) each exclusivity graph is an induced graph of an atom graph. (i) and (ii) show that the quantum systems are uniquely determined by their atom graphs. which proves the reasonability of graphs as the models of quantum experiments. (iii) establishes a connection between partial Boolean algebra and exclusivity graphs, and introduces a method to express the exclusivity experiments more precisely. We also present a general and parametric description for Kochen-Specker theorem based on graphs, which gives a type of non-contextuality inequality for KS contextuality.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a class of entanglement witnesses where each witness is formulated as a difference of two product observables. These observables are decomposable into positive semidefinite local operators that obey a partial ordering rule defined over all their possible expectation values. We provide a framework to construct these entanglement witnesses along with some examples. We also discuss methods to improve them both linearly and nonlinearly.</description>

      <title>Surface Scattering Expansion for the Casimir-Polder Interaction of a Dielectric Wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic scattering amplitude of a dielectric wedge is not known in closed form. This makes the computation of the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between a polarizable particle and a dielectric wedge challenging. This geometry is a prototype for the effect of edges on fluctuation-induced interactions, and hence it is important to employ new methods for this problem. Using a recently developed multiple scattering expansion [T. Emig and G. Bimonte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 200401 (2023)], here we implement a basis-free numerical evaluation of this expansion to obtain precise estimates of the CP potential for a wedge over a wide range of dielectric constants. A remarkable finding is that the CP potential for a dielectric wedge with a smoothed edge is closely related to the potential of a sharp wedge made of a perfect electric conductor. The latter potential is known exactly, making this relation particularly useful in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing with qudits, an extension of qubits to multiple levels, is a research field less mature than qubit-based quantum computing. However, qudits can offer some advantages over qubits, by representing information with fewer separated components. In this article, we present QuForge, a Python-based library designed to simulate quantum circuits with qudits. This library provides the necessary quantum gates for implementing quantum algorithms, tailored to any chosen qudit dimension. Built on top of differentiable frameworks, QuForge supports execution on accelerating devices such as GPUs and TPUs, significantly speeding up simulations. It also supports sparse operations, leading to a reduction in memory consumption compared to other libraries. Additionally, by constructing quantum circuits as differentiable graphs, QuForge facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms, enhancing the capabilities and flexibility of quantum computing research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) offers potential advantages over classical reservoir computing, including inherent processing of quantum inputs and a vast Hilbert space for state exploration. Yet, the relation between the performance of reservoirs based on complex and many-body quantum systems and non-classical state features is not established. Through an extensive analysis of QRC based on a transverse-field Ising model we show how different quantum effects, such as quantum coherence and correlations, contribute to improving the performance in temporal tasks, as measured by the Information Processing Capacity. Additionally, we critically assess the impact of finite measurement resources and noise on the reservoir's dynamics in different regimes, quantifying the limited ability to exploit quantum effects for increasing damping and noise strengths. Our results reveal a monotonic relationship between reservoir performance and coherence, along with the importance of quantum effects in the ergodic regime.</description>

      <title>Pure state entanglement and von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem to arbitrary factors. As in the matrix algebra case, the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is connected to the majorization of their restrictions. Our theorem implies that, in a bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite one-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of entanglement monotones carries over using majorization theory. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider an open quantum system undergoing Markovian dynamics, the latter being modelled by a discrete-time quantum Markov semigroup $\{\Phi^n\}_{n \in {\mathbb{N}}}$, resulting from the action of sequential uses of a quantum channel $\Phi$, with $n \in {\mathbb{N}}$ being the discrete time parameter. We find upper and lower bounds on the one-shot $\epsilon$-error information transmission capacities of $\Phi^n$ for a finite time $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon \in [0,1)$ in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the channel $\Phi$. We consider transmission of $(i)$ classical information (both in the unassisted and entanglement-assisted settings); $(ii)$ quantum information and $(iii)$ private classical information.</description>

Abstract: While commonly used entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems are based on quadrature measurements, here we study entanglement detection from measurements of the Wigner function. These are routinely performed in platforms such as trapped ions and circuit QED, where homodyne measurements are difficult to be implemented. We provide complementary criteria which we show to be tight for a variety of experimentally relevant Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Our results show novel approaches to detect entanglement in continuous variable systems and shed light on interesting connections between known criteria and the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Codesigned counterdiabatic quantum optimization on a photonic quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codesign, an integral part of computer architecture referring to the information interaction in hardware-software stack, is able to boost the algorithm mapping and execution in the computer hardware. This well applies to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where quantum algorithms and quantum processors both need to be shaped to allow for advantages in experimental implementations. The state-of-the-art quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm faces challenges for scaling up, where the deteriorating optimization performance is not necessarily alleviated by increasing the circuit depth given the noise in the hardware. The counterdiabatic term can be introduced to accelerate the convergence, but decomposing the unitary operator corresponding to the counterdiabatic terms into one and two-qubit gates may add additional burden to the digital circuit depth. In this work, we focus on the counterdiabatic protocol with a codesigned approach to implement this algorithm on a photonic quantum processor. The tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh provides rich programmable parameters for local and global manipulation, making it able to perform arbitrary unitary evolutions. Accordingly, we directly implement the unitary operation associated to the counterdiabatic quantum optimization on our processor without prior digitization. Furthermore, we develop and implement an optimized counterdiabatic method by tackling the higher-order many-body interaction terms. Moreover, we benchmark the performance in the case of factorization, by comparing the final success probability and the convergence speed. In conclusion, we experimentally demonstrate the advantages of a codesigned mapping of counterdiabatic quantum dynamics for quantum computing on photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale on-demand photon polarization manipulation with high-efficiency for integrated photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to overcome the challenge of lacking polarization encoding in integrated quantum photonic circuits, we propose a scheme to realize arbitrary polarization manipulation of a single photon by integrating a single quantum emitter in a photonic waveguide. In our scheme, one transition path of the three-level emitter is designed to simultaneously couples with two orthogonal polarization degenerate modes in the waveguide with adjustable coupling strengths, and the other transition path of the three-level emitter is driven by an external coherent field. The proposed polarization converter has several advantages, including arbitrary polarization conversion for any input polarization, tunable working frequency, excellent anti-dissipation ability with high conversion efficiency, and atomic-scale size. Our work provides an effective solution to enable the polarization encoding of photons which can be applied in the integrated quantum photonic circuits, and will boost quantum photonic chip.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum (tensor product) expanders from unitary designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).</description>

      <title>Ecosystem-Agnostic Standardization of Quantum Runtime Architecture: Accelerating Utility in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault tolerance is a long-term objective driving many companies and research organizations to compete in making current, imperfect quantum computers useful - Quantum Utility (QU). It looks promising to achieve this by leveraging software optimization approaches primarily driven by AI techniques. This aggressive research covers all layers of Quantum Computing Optimization Middleware (QCOM) and requires execution on real quantum hardware (QH). Due to the nascent nature of the technology domain and the proprietary strategies of both large and small players, popular runtimes for executing quantum workloads lack flexibility in programming models, scheduling, and hardware access patterns, including queuing, which creates roadblocks for researchers and slows innovation. These problems are further exacerbated by emerging hybrid operating models that place Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) supercomputing and Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) at the heart of real-time computations across quantum and distributed resources. There is a need for a widely adopted runtime platform (RP) driven by the open-source community that can be easily deployed to work in a distributed manner between Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), GPU, control hardware, external compute resources and provide required flexibility in terms of programming &amp; configuration models.</description>

      <title>Stability of saddles and choices of contour in the Euclidean path integral for linearized gravity: Dependence on the DeWitt Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the conformal factor problem, the definition of the Euclidean gravitational path integral requires a non-trivial choice of contour. The present work examines a generalization of a recently proposed rule-of-thumb \cite{Marolf:2022ntb} for selecting this contour at quadratic order about a saddle. The original proposal depended on the choice of an indefinite-signature metric on the space of perturbations, which was taken to be a DeWitt metric with parameter $\alpha =-1$. This choice was made to match previous results, but was otherwise admittedly {\it ad hoc}. To begin to investigate the physics associated with the choice of such a metric, we now explore contours defined using analogous prescriptions for $\alpha \neq -1$. We study such contours for Euclidean gravity linearized about AdS-Schwarzschild black holes in reflecting cavities with thermal (canonical ensemble) boundary conditions, and we compare path-integral stability of the associated saddles with thermodynamic stability of the classical spacetimes. While the contour generally depends on the choice of DeWitt parameter $\alpha$, the precise agreement between these two notions of stability found at $\alpha =-1$ continues to hold over the finite interval $(-2,-2/d)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the bulk spacetime. This agreement manifestly fails for $\alpha &gt; -2/d$ when the DeWitt metric becomes positive definite. However, we also find dramatic failures for $\alpha&lt; -2$ that correlate with breakdowns of the de Donder-like gauge condition defined by $\alpha$, and at which the relevant fluctuation operator fails to be diagonalizable. This provides criteria that may be useful in predicting metrics on the space of perturbations that give physically-useful contours in more general settings. Along the way, we also identify an interesting error in \cite{Marolf:2022ntb}, though we show this error to be harmless.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mechanisms of qubit representations and introducing a new category system for visual representations: Results from expert ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum physics (QP) education, the use of representations such as diagrams and visual aids that connect to mathematical concepts is crucial. Research in representation theory indicates that combining symbolic-mathematical elements (e.g. formulae) with visual-graphical representations enhances conceptual understanding more effectively than representations that merely depict phenomena. However, common representations vary widely, and existing categorisation systems do not adequately distinguish between them in QP. To address this, we developed a new set of differentiation criteria based on insights from representation research, QP education, and specific aspects of the quantum sciences. We created a comprehensive category system for evaluating visual QP representations for educational use, grounded in Ainsworths (2006) DeFT Framework. Twenty-one experts from four countries evaluated this category system using four qubit representations: the Bloch sphere, Circle Notation, Quantum Bead, and the pie chart (Qake) model. This evaluation enabled us to assess the discriminative power of our criteria and the effectiveness of each representation in supporting the learning of QP concepts. It evaluated how well each representation conveyed quantum concepts such as quantum state, measurement, superposition, entanglement, and quantum technologies (X-, Z-, and H-gates) across 16 criteria. The results showed significant differences in the effectiveness of these representations, particularly in conveying key concepts like superposition and measurement. Additionally, expert ratings indicated notable variations in the potential of each representation to induce misconceptions, linked to differences in shape, measurement behaviour, and requirements for understanding entanglement. We also discuss considerations for developing new representations and suggest directions for future empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays today offer powerful platforms for studying strongly correlated phases of quantum matter. Here, we employ the projective symmetry group framework to describe the symmetry fractionalization patterns in a topologically ordered $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) synthesized in such a Rydberg array on the ruby lattice. By systematically comparing the static structure factors of $\textit{all}$ possible mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ against density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a promising candidate for the precise $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ QSL realized microscopically. We also present detailed analyses of the dynamical structure factors as a reference for future experiments and showcase how these spin correlations can differentiate between varied QSL $\textit{Ans\"atze}$.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and the Noncrossing Partition Lattice in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate details of the chaotic dynamics of dual-unitary quantum circuits by evaluating all $2k$-point out-of-time-ordered correlators. For the generic class of circuits, by writing the correlators as contractions of a class of quantum channels, we prove their exponential decay. This implies that local operators separated in time approach free independence. Along the way, we develop a replica trick for dual-unitary circuits, which may be useful and of interest in its own right. We classify the relevant eigenstates of the replica transfer matrix by paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, combinatorial objects central to free probability theory. Interestingly, the noncrossing lattice emerges even for systems without randomness and with small onsite Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.</description>

Abstract: We present an algebraic method to derive the structure at the basis of the mapping of bosonic algebras of creation and annihilation operators into fermionic algebras, and vice versa, introducing a suitable identification between bosonic and fermionic generators. The algebraic structure thus obtained corresponds to a deformed Grassmann algebra, involving anticommuting Grassmann-type variables. The role played by the latter in the implementation of gauge invariance in second quantization within our procedure is then discussed, together with the application of the mapping to the case of the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities and prove the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

Since it has a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it can be used for testing quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory at nonzero baryon density.

      <description>arXiv:2409.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an external cavity laser with intrinsic linewidth below 100 Hz around an operating wavelength of 852 nm, selected for its relevance to laser cooling and manipulation of cesium atoms. This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

      <title>Zak Phase Induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological physics provides novel insights for designing functional photonic devices, such as magnetic-free optical diodes, which are important in optical engineering and quantum information processing. Past efforts mostly focus on the topological edge modes in two-dimensional (2D) photonic Chern lattices, which, however, require delicate fabrication and temporal modulation. In particular, the 1D nonreciprocal edge mode needs to be embedded in a 2D lattice, contradicting with the compactness of integrated photonics. To address these challenges, we investigate the optical nonreciprocity of the 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) superradiance lattices in room-temperature atoms. The probe fields propagating in two opposite directions perceive two different SSH topological phases, which have different absorption spectra due to the interplay between the Zak phase and the thermal motion of atoms, resulting in optical nonreciprocity. Our findings reveal the relationship between 1D topological matter and optical nonreciprocity, simplifying the design of topologically resilient nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear Magnetism at Ultralow and Zero Field using SQUIDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs), where empirical data on how nuclear magnetism behaves is lacking. The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a hyperpolarization reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Afterwards, we were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the results of the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4%, a signal enhancement of ~100 000 000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field (~50 $\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 7.44$\pm$0.91 pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for the first direct detection of nuclear magnetism without system perturbation.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits many systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3~kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

      <title>Formal verification of higher dimensional quantum protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal methods have been a successful approach for modelling and verifying the correctness of complex technologies like microprocessor chip design, biological systems and others. This is the main motivation of developing quantum formal techniques which is to describe and analyse quantum information processing systems. Our previous work demonstrates the possibility of using a quantum process calculus called Communicating Quantum Processes (CQP) to model and describe higher dimensional quantum systems. By developing the theory to generalise the fundamental gates and Bell states, we have modelled quantum qudit protocols like teleportation and superdense coding in CQP. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of CQP to analyse higher dimensional quantum protocols. The main idea is to define two processes, one modelling the real protocol and the other expressing a specification, and prove that they are behaviourally equivalent. This is a work-in-progress and we present our preliminary results in extending the theory of behavioural equivalence in CQP to verify higher dimensional quantum protocols using qudits.</description>

      <title>Low Photon Number Non-Invasive Imaging Through Time-Varying Diffusers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering poses a significant challenge in optical imaging. In microscopy, it leads to progressive degradation of image quality preventing sample examination at increasing depths. As the thickness of the sample increases, the number of photons that can successfully pass through it decreases, leading to a reduced signal and preventing us from obtaining clear images. Imaging becomes even more difficult with dynamic scatterers like biological tissues that change over time. We demonstrate non-invasive imaging of fluorescent objects hidden behind dynamic diffusers. Our reconstruction uses a stack of images recorded for different diffuser realizations and works even when individual camera frames contain small photon numbers.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-belt magneto-optical trapping of molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is used to produce ultracold atoms and molecules for quantum science and precision measurement applications. Molecules are more challenging to cool than atoms due to their vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom. Molecular rotations lead to the use of type-II transitions ($F \geq F'$) for magneto-optical trapping (MOT). When typical red detuned light frequencies are applied to these transitions, sub-Doppler heating is induced, resulting in higher temperatures and larger molecular cloud sizes than realized with the type-I MOTs most often used with atoms. To improve type-II MOTs, Jarvis et al. PRL 120, 083201 (2018) proposed a blue-detuned MOT to be applied after initial cooling and capture with a red-detuned MOT. This was successfully implemented (Burau et al. PRL 130, 193401 (2023), Jorapur et al. PRL 132, 163403 (2024), Li et al. PRL 132, 233402 (2024)), realizing colder and denser molecular samples. Very recently, Hallas et al. arXiv:2404.03636 (2024) demonstrated a blue-detuned MOT with a "1+2" configuration that resulted in even stronger compression of the molecular cloud. Here, we describe and characterize theoretically the conveyor-belt mechanism that underlies this observed enhanced compression. We perform numerical simulations of the conveyor-belt mechanism using both stochastic Schr\"odinger equation (SSE) and optical Bloch equation (OBE) approaches. We investigate the conveyor-belt MOT characteristics in relation to laser parameters, g-factors, and the structure of the molecular system.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove that any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$, i.e., the singular part of the ratio of thermal expansion to the specific heat, has been broadly employed to explore both finite-$T$ and quantum critical points (QCPs). For a genuine quantum phase transition (QPT), thermal fluctuations are absent and thus the thermodynamic $\Gamma$ cannot be employed. We propose a quantum analogue to $\Gamma$ that computes entanglement as a function of a tuning parameter $\lambda$ and show that QPTs take place only for systems in which the ground-state energy depends on $\lambda$ non-linearly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the breakdown of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem in the thermodynamic limit at any QCP. We showcase our approach using the quantum 1D Ising model with transverse field and Kane's quantum computer. The slowing down of the dynamics and thus the "creation of mass" close to any QCP/QPT is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of the interconnections between single-mode, phaseinsensitive Gaussian Bosonic Channels resulting from channel concatenation. This characterization enables us to identify, in the parameter space of these maps, two distinct regions: low-ground and high-ground. In the low-ground region, the information capacities are smaller than a designated reference value, while in the high-ground region, they are provably greater. As a direct consequence, we systematically outline an explicit set of upper bounds for the quantum and private capacity of these maps, which combine known upper bounds and composition rules, improving upon existing results.</description>

      <title>High fidelity macroscopic superposition states via shortcut to adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shortcut to an adiabatic scheme is proposed for preparing a massive object in a macroscopic spatial superposition state. In this scheme we propose to employ counterdiabatic driving to maintain the system in the ground state of its instantaneous Hamiltonian while the trap potential is tuned from a parabola to a double well. This, in turn, is performed by properly ramping a control parameter. We show that a few counterdiabatic drives are enough for most practical cases. A hybrid electromechanical setup in superconducting circuits is proposed for the implementation. The efficiency of our scheme is benchmarked by numerically solving the system dynamics in the presence of noises and imperfections. The results show that a mechanical resonator with very-high-fidelity spatially distinguishable cat states can be prepared with our protocol. Furthermore, the protocol is robust against noises and imperfections. We also discuss a method for verifying the final state via spectroscopy of a coupled circuit electrodynamical cavity mode. Our work can serve as the ground work to feasibly realize and verify macroscopic superposition states in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze and bound the effect of modeling errors on the stabilization of pure states or subspaces for quantum stochastic evolutions. Different approaches are used for open-loop and feedback control protocols. For both, we highlight the key role of dynamical invariance of the target: if the perturbation preserves invariance, it is possible to prove that it also preserves its attractivity, under some additional assumptions. In addition, we prove boundedness in mean of the solutions of perturbed systems under open-loop protocols. For the feedback strategies, in the general case without assumptions on invariance, we provide bounds on the perturbation effect in expectation and in probability, as well as specific bounds for non-demolition nominal systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Number of States via the Rodeo Algorithm for Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of statistical physics, the number of states in which a system can be realized with a given energy is a key concept that bridges the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems. For quantum systems, many approaches rely on the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate how the recently developed rodeo algorithm can be utilized to determine the number of states associated with all energy levels without any prior knowledge of the eigenstates. Quantum computers, with their innate ability to address the intricacies of quantum systems, make this approach particularly promising for the study of the thermodynamics of those systems. To illustrate the procedure's effectiveness, we apply it to compute the number of states of the 1D transverse-field Ising model and, consequently, its specific heat, proving the reliability of the method presented here.</description>

      <title>Towards determining the presence of barren plateaus in some chemically inspired variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for molecular simulations on near-term quantum computers. However, VQEs using hardware-efficient circuits face scaling challenges due to the barren plateau problem. This raises the question of whether chemically inspired circuits from unitary coupled cluster (UCC) methods can avoid this issue. Here we provide theoretical evidence indicating they may not. By examining alternated dUCC ans\"atze and relaxed Trotterized UCC ans\"atze, we find that in the infinite depth limit, a separation occurs between particle-hole one- and two-body unitary operators. While one-body terms yield a polynomially concentrated energy landscape, adding two-body terms leads to exponential concentration. Numerical simulations support these findings, suggesting that popular 1-step Trotterized unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ans\"atze may not scale. Our results emphasize the link between trainability and circuit expressiveness, raising doubts about VQEs' ability to surpass classical methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory assisted entangled state verification with local measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum memory assisted quantum state verification task, where an adversary prepare independent multipartite entangled states and send to the local verifiers, who then store several copies in the quantum memory and measure them collectively to make decision. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy state verification, where the verifiers store two copies, and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for multi-qubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. When the verifiers can store arbitrarily many copies, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient verification strategies for this case, showcasing its application to efficiently verifying GHZ-like states. These strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources, ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that quantum memories enhance state verification efficiency, sheding light on error-resistant strategies and practical applications of large-scale quantum memory-assisted verification.</description>

      <title>Fast multicomponent cat-state generation under resonant or strong-dressing Rydberg-Kerr interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cat states are maximally entangled states with applications in metrology and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The experiments have revealed that Rydberg collective avalanche decoherence acts as the bottleneck for cat creation with Rydberg atoms. This process initiates after the black body radiation (BBR-)induced decay of Rydberg atoms and sets a strong limit on the cat creation time. These findings necessitate the exploration of new ideas to accelerate current Rydberg cat schemes. To enhance the interaction-to-loss ratio, this paper delves into cat state formation in the strong Rydberg dressing regime, uncovering the emergence of cat states despite the presence of complex orders of nonlinearities. This unexplored regime demonstrates the potential for rapid cat state formation, particularly beneficial for operation in typical 2D lattices in Rydberg Labs. In an extreme case, this article demonstrates that second-order nonlinearity could be isolated under resonant Rydberg driving if a large number of atoms are accommodated inside the blockade volume. The resonant model significantly enhances the interaction-to-loss ratio while circumventing the adiabaticity condition, allowing fast switching of lasers. In addition, the paper presents a method for generating multi-component cat states, which are superpositions of $m$ coherent spin states ($|m-\text{CSS}\rangle$). The maximum value of $m$ is determined by the number of atoms within the blockade radius, where $m=\sqrt{N}$. The states with larger $m$ are more robust against the presence of multiple orders of nonlinearity in the strong dressing Hamiltonian and are accessible in a much shorter time compared to traditional 2-component cat states.</description>

Abstract: Recent no-go theorems on interpretations of quantum theory featuring an assumption of `Absoluteness of Observed Events' (AOE) are shown to have an unexpectedly strong corollary: one cannot reject AOE and at the same time assume that the `observed events' in question can all be embedded within a single background space-time common to all observers. Consequently, interpretations that reject AOE appear incompatible with a `block universe' view of space-time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiple Eigenvalue Gaussian filtered Search: an efficient and versatile quantum phase estimation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the most powerful quantum primitives. This work proposes a new approach for the problem of multiple eigenvalue estimation: Quantum Multiple Eigenvalue Gaussian filtered Search (QMEGS). QMEGS leverages the Hadamard test circuit structure and only requires simple classical postprocessing. QMEGS is the first algorithm to simultaneously satisfy the following two properties: (1) It can achieve the Heisenberg-limited scaling without relying on any spectral gap assumption. (2) With a positive energy gap and additional assumptions on the initial state, QMEGS can estimate all dominant eigenvalues to $\epsilon$ accuracy utilizing a significantly reduced circuit depth compared to the standard quantum phase estimation algorithm. In the most favorable scenario, the maximal runtime can be reduced to as low as $\log(1/\epsilon)$. This implies that QMEGS serves as an efficient and versatile approach, achieving the best-known results for both gapped and gapless systems. Numerical results validate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm in various regimes.</description>

      <title>Image Denoising with Machine Learning: A Novel Approach to Improve Quantum Image Processing Quality and Reliability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Image Processing (QIP) is a field that aims to utilize the benefits of quantum computing for manipulating and analyzing images. However, QIP faces two challenges: the limitation of qubits and the presence of noise in a quantum machine. In this research, we propose a novel approach to address the issue of noise in QIP. By training and employing a machine learning model that identifies and corrects the noise in quantum-processed images, we can compensate for the noisiness caused by the machine and retrieve a processing result similar to that performed by a classical computer with higher efficiency. The model is trained by learning a dataset consisting of both existing processed images and quantum-processed images from open-access datasets. This model will be capable of providing us with the confidence level for each pixel and its potential original value. To assess the model's accuracy in compensating for loss and decoherence in QIP, we evaluate it using three metrics: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Additionally, we discuss the applicability of our model across domains well as its cost effectiveness compared to alternative methods.</description>

Abstract: We present a general driving protocol for many-body systems to generate a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries. This imprints emergent quasi-conservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure: recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small amount of entanglement, thus deviating from the "maximum-entropy principle" that underpins thermodynamics. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp pseudothermalization transitions.</description>

      <title>Protocols and Trade-Offs of Quantum State Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state purification is crucial in quantum communication and computation, aiming to recover a purified state from multiple copies of an unknown noisy state. This work introduces a general state purification framework designed to achieve the highest fidelity with a specified probability and characterize the associated trade-offs. For i.i.d. quantum states under depolarizing noise, our framework can replicate the purification protocol proposed by [Barenco et al., SIAM Journal on Computing, 26(5), 1997] and further provide exact formulas for the purification fidelity and probability with explicit trade-offs. We prove the protocols' optimality for two copies of noisy states with any dimension and confirm its optimality for higher numbers of copies and dimensions through numerical analysis. Our methodological approach paves the way for proving the protocol's optimality in more general scenarios and leads to optimal protocols for other noise models. Furthermore, we present a systematic implementation method via block encoding and parameterized quantum circuits, providing explicit circuits for purifying three-copy and four-copy states under depolarizing noise. Finally, we estimate the sample complexity and generalize the protocol to a recursive form, demonstrating its practicality for quantum computers with limited memory.</description>

      <title>Progressive Quantum Algorithm for Maximum Independent Set with Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Hadfield et al. proposed the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) to tackle Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CCOPs). This paper proposes a Progressive Quantum Algorithm (PQA) to reduce the required qubits in solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem using QAOA+ ansatz. PQA constructs a subgraph that contains the MIS solution of the target graph $G$ and then solves the MIS problem on this subgraph to obtain the solution for $G$. To induce such a subgraph, PQA starts with a small-scale initial subgraph and progressively expands its graph size utilizing designed expansion rules. After each expansion, PQA solves the MIS problem on the current subgraph using QAOA+. In each run, PQA repeats the graph expansion and solving process until a predefined stopping condition is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that to achieve an optimal approximation ratio of 0.95, PQA requires only $5.5565\%$ ($15.4\%$) of the qubits and $10.695\%$ ($7.23\%$) of the runtime compared with QAOA+ on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (regular) graphs, highlighting the efficiency of PQA.</description>

      <title>Information revival without backflow: non-causal explanations for non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of information revivals, witnessing the violation of certain data-processing inequalities, has provided an important paradigm in the study of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes. Although often used interchangeably, we argue here that the notions of "revivals" and "backflows", i.e., flows of information from the environment back into the system, are distinct: an information revival can occur without any backflow ever taking place. In this paper, we examine in detail the phenomenon of non-causal revivals and relate them to the theory of short Markov chains and squashed non-Markovianity. We also provide an operational condition, in terms of system-only degrees of freedom, to witness the presence of genuine backflow that cannot be explained by non-causal revivals. As a byproduct, we demonstrate that focusing on processes with genuine backflows, while excluding those with only non-causal revivals, resolves the issue of non-convexity of Markovianity, thus enabling the construction of a convex resource theory of genuine quantum non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>On computing quantum waves and spin from classical and relativistic action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schroedinger equation of quantum physics can be solved using a generalized form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi least action equation, extending a key result of Feynman applicable only to quadratic actions. The results, which extend to the relativistic setting, build on two developments.
  The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical least action problem. This leads to multi-valued least action solutions where each local action is its own set element. The multiple solutions replace in part the probabilistic setting by the non-uniqueness of solutions of the constrained problem. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create impulsive constraint forces, which lead to multiple path solutions.
  Second, an approximate mapping $ \ \Psi \approx e^{\frac{i }{\hbar} \Phi } \ $ between action $\Phi$ and wave function $\Psi$ has been known since Dirac and even Schroedinger. We show that this mapping can be made exact by introducing a compression ratio of the proposed multi-valued action, which can in turn be interpreted as a probability density on classical trajectories of a fluid flow field. Branch points of the multi-valued least action imply a quantum wave collapse.
  These developments leave the results of associated Feynman path integrals unchanged, but the computation can be greatly simplified as only multi-valued least actions are used, avoiding time-slicing and zig-zag trajectories altogether. They also suggest a smooth transition between physics across scales, with the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism extending to general relativity, in a coordinate-invariant framework. In particular, the Klein-Gordon equation may have a natural extension to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is the best probe for multiparameter estimation of independent local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of local quantum fields is a crucial aspect of quantum metrology applications, and often also forms the test-bed to analyze the utility of quantum resources, like entanglement. However, so far, this has been analyzed using the same local field for all the probes, and so, although the encoding process utilizes a local Hamiltonian, there is an inherent ``nonlocality" in the encoding process in the form of a common local field applied on all the probes. We show that estimation of even independent multiple field strengths of a local Hamiltonian, i.e., one formed by a sum of single-party terms, necessitates the utility of a highly symmetric genuine multiparty entangled state, viz. the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, as the input probe. The feature depends on the choice of the weight matrix considered, to define a figure of merit in the multiparameter estimation. We obtain this result by providing a lower bound on the precision of multiparameter estimation, optimized over input probes, for an arbitrary weight matrix. We find that the bound can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues of the arbitrary multiparty local encoding Hamiltonian. We show that there exists a weight matrix for which this bound is attainable only when the probe is the GHZ state, up to a relative phase. In particular, no pure product state can achieve this lower bound, and the gap in precision with genuinely multiparty entangled states acting as probes increases with increasing number of parties. We finally prove that using a probe that is in any mixed state provides a precision lower than that for the GHZ. To emphasize the importance of the weight matrix considered, we show that choosing the identity operator as the same - thereby ignoring the ``off-diagonal'' covariances in the precision matrix - leads to a product probe attaining the best precision.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>

Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Machine Learning Decoder for 3D Toric Codes</title>

Abstract: Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors. Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems, error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a $d$-dimensional surface. For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice. The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Methods under Scrutiny: A Benchmarking Study</title>

Abstract: Since the entry of kernel theory in the field of quantum machine learning, quantum kernel methods (QKMs) have gained increasing attention with regard to both probing promising applications and delivering intriguing research insights. Two common approaches for computing the underlying Gram matrix have emerged: fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs). Benchmarking these methods is crucial to gain robust insights and to understand their practical utility. In this work, we present a comprehensive large-scale study examining QKMs based on FQKs and PQKs across a manifold of design choices. Our investigation encompasses both classification and regression tasks for five dataset families and 64 datasets, systematically comparing the use of FQKs and PQKs quantum support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This resulted in over 20,000 models that were trained and optimized using a state-of-the-art hyperparameter search to ensure robust and comprehensive insights. We delve into the importance of hyperparameters on model performance scores and support our findings through rigorous correlation analyses. In this, we also closely inspect two data encoding strategies. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis addressing the design freedom of PQKs and explore the underlying principles responsible for learning. Our goal is not to identify the best-performing model for a specific task but to uncover the mechanisms that lead to effective QKMs and reveal universal patterns.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation: Arbitrary bi-modal Information State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical coherent states are experimentally realizable continuous variable quantum states of which preparation by lasers, as well as its manipulation and monitoring by linear optical gadgets are well established. We propose a strategy to send an arbitrary superposition of four-component bimodal entangled coherent states from a sender to a receiver who, simultaneously, tries to transmit an unknown Schrodinger Cat coherent state to sender via employing a cluster consisting of three superposition of two component bimodal entangled coherent states as the quantum channel and utilizing linear optical gadgets. Heralded detection of photons in laboratories of sender and receiver followed by classical communications of even and odd number of photons and local unitary operations, impeccably, accomplishes simultaneous faithful asymmetric bidirectional quantum teleportation with one eighth of probability of success. It is seen that not all detection events implement the protocol and, therefore, one has to locally apply displacement operator, a necessary evil. We analyze near faithful partial asymmetric bidirectional quantum teleportation and associated probability of success therein. We demonstrated that, for an intense coherent optical field, fidelity approach unity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we approach the structure of the quantum measuring system in the Euclidean regime of the classicalized holographic tensor network from the perspective of integrated information theory. As a result, we obtain the following picture of the Euclidean regime. First, there are complexes, which are independently accompanied by the level and structure of experiences, determined from the full transition probability matrix of the whole particle system. Second, the cause-effect structures of independent complexes would be directly entangled by the physical information propagation in the whole particle system. Finally, distinct full transition probability matrices of the whole particle system that exhibit the maximum cause-effect power may coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A state vector-based quantum circuit simulation can provide accurate results for the development and validation of quantum computing algorithms, without being affected by noise interference. However, existing quantum circuit simulators have consistently underperformed due to inadequate integration with quantum circuits and high-performance computing architectures. To tackle the challenges in quantum computing, we propose QueenV2, which builds upon the design principles of Queen and elevates performance to a new level. Experimental results on the NVIDIA RTX-4090 demonstrate that QueenV2 achieves up to a 40x improvement in gate performance and a 5x improvement in circuit performance compared to hyQuas. Furthermore, QueenV2 realizes a 137x speedup in gate benchmarks and a 14x speedup in circuit performance relative to NVIDIA cuQuantum, enabled by gate fusion via the IBM Qiskit toolkit. By eliminating reliance on third-party libraries, QueenV2 is positioned to significantly accelerate quantum circuit simulation, thus promoting the development of innovative accelerators and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Top Manifold Connectedness of Quantum Control Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of quantum systems has been proven to possess trap-free optimization landscapes under the satisfaction of proper assumptions. However, many details of the landscape geometry and their influence on search efficiency still need to be fully understood. This paper numerically explores the path-connectedness of globally optimal control solutions forming the top manifold of the landscape. We randomly sample a plurality of optimal controls in the top manifold to assess the existence of a continuous path at the top of the landscape that connects two arbitrary optimal solutions. It is shown that for different quantum control objectives including state-to-state transition probabilities, observable expectation values and unitary transformations, such a continuous path can be readily found, implying that these top manifolds are fundamentally path-connected. The significance of the latter conjecture lies in seeking locations in the top manifold where an ancillary objective can also be optimized while maintaining the full optimality of the original objective that defined the landscape.</description>

      <title>Defining a universal sign to strictly probe a phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science 375, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to reveal the multipartite entanglement encoded in the full reduced density matrix of microscopic subregion both in spin and fermionic many-body systems. We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement with our two witnesses in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We further establish the singular scaling of general multipartite entanglement measures at criticality, and present an explicit analysis in the tripartite case. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power-law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Entanglement microscopy opens a rich window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, ``gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of non-modular braided fusion categories.</description>

Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce {\em quantum population dynamics} as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr\"odinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical ``Schr\"odigner cat'' population model on a $d$-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr\"odinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic QED and noise currents in time-varying media</title>

Abstract: Macroscopic QED (MQED) is the field theory for computing quantum electromagnetic effects in dispersive media. Here we extend MQD to treat time-varying, dispersive media. For a time dependent Drude model, we find that the expected replacement ${\epsilon}({\omega}) {\to} {\epsilon}(t,{\omega})$ within standard MQED leads to nonphysical polarization currents, becoming singular in the limit of a step change in the carrier density. We show this singular behaviour can be removed through modifying the reservoir dynamics, quantizing the resulting theory and finding the non-equilibrium, time-varying noise currents, which exhibit extra correlations due to temporal reflections within the material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy, Crystal-Field, and Transition Intensity Analyses of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) Centre in Er$^{3+}$ Doped CaF$_{2}$ Crystals</title>

Abstract: Erbium ions in crystals show considerable promise for the technologies that will form the backbone of future networked quantum information technology. Despite advances in leveraging erbium's fibre-compatible infrared transition for classical and quantum applications, the transitions are, in general, not well understood. We present detailed absorption and laser site-selective spectroscopy of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) centre in CaF$_2$:Er$^{3+}$ as an interesting erbium site case study. The $^{4}$I$_{15/2}$Z$_1 \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{13/2}$Y$_1$ transition has a low-temperature inhomogeneous linewidth of 1 GHz with hyperfine structure observable from the $^{167}$Er isotope. A parametrized crystal-field Hamiltonian is fitted to 34 energy levels and the two ground state magnetic splitting factors. The wavefunctions are used to perform a transition intensity analysis and electric-dipole parameters are fitted to absorption oscillator strengths. Simulated spectra for the $^{4}$I$_{11/2}\rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ and $^{4}$I$_{13/2} \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ inter-multiplet transitions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spectra. The $^{4}$I$_{13/2}$ excited state lifetime is 25.0\,ms and the intensity calculation is in excellent agreement with this value.</description>

      <title>Laser Site-Selective Spectroscopy and Magnetic Hyperfine Splittings of Ho$^{3+}$ doped Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser site-selective spectroscopy and high-resolution absorption measurements have been used to determine 51 crystal-field energy levels for one of the Ho$^{3+}$ centres in Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$. This centre is denoted as Site 2 and has been tentatively assigned as the seven-fold coordinated centre. High resolution absorption measurements reveal complex hyperfine patterns that obey and approximate selection rule. The application of a magnetic field along the three optical axes reveals the presence of avoided crossings below 0.5 Tesla, in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Crystal-Field Analysis of Low -Symmetry Er$^{3+}$ Centres in K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>

Abstract: K$_2$YF$_5$ crystals doped with lanthanide ions have a variety of possible optical applications. Owing to the low symmetry of the system, the crystal structure cannot be unambiguously determined by x-ray diffraction. However, electron-paramagnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that lanthanide ions substitute for yttrium in sites of C$_{\rm s}$ local symmetry. In this work, we use high-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy to determine electronic energy levels for Er$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 39 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 7 multiplets of the Er$^{3+}$ ion, have been assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Er$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Our model is fitted not only to the electronic energy levels, but also to the ground-state g-tensor. This magnetic-splitting data defines the axis system of the calculation, avoiding ambiguities associated with low-symmetry crystal-field fits.</description>
