      <title>kNNSampler: Stochastic Imputations for Recovering Missing Value Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing response given an observed covariate. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in recovering the distribution of missing values. The code for kNNSampler is made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression -- Neural Network Hybrid with Optimized Redundant Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a Gaussian Process Regression - neural network (GPRNN) hybrid machine learning method was proposed, which is based on additive-kernel GPR in redundant coordinates constructed by rules [J. Phys. Chem. A 127 (2023) 7823]. The method combined the expressive power of an NN with the robustness of linear regression, in particular, with respect to overfitting when the number of neurons is increased beyond optimal. We introduce opt-GPRNN, in which the redundant coordinates of GPRNN are optimized with a Monte Carlo algorithm and show that when combined with optimization of redundant coordinates, GPRNN attains the lowest test set error with much fewer terms / neurons and retains the advantage of avoiding overfitting when the number of neurons is increased beyond optimal value. The method, opt-GPRNN possesses an expressive power closer to that of a multilayer NN and could obviate the need for deep NNs in some applications. With optimized redundant coordinates, a dimensionality reduction regime is also possible. Examples of application to machine learning an interatomic potential and materials informatics are given.</description>

      <title>PEHRT: A Common Pipeline for Harmonizing Electronic Health Record data for Translational Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrative analysis of multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data enhances the reliability and generalizability of translational research by leveraging larger, more diverse patient cohorts and incorporating multiple data modalities. However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical entropy method for the delocalization of bias in high-dimensional Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024) identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy (a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Multitype Protected Attributes: Intersectional Fairness through Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however, methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called "fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength, including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset.</description>

      <title>Prescribe-then-Select: Adaptive Policy Selection for Contextual Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings, multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the code to reproduce the results can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Prescribe-then-Select-TMLR.</description>

      <title>Modified Loss of Momentum Gradient Descent: Fine-Grained Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory. Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in $\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics, generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bias in the Loop: How Humans Evaluate AI-Generated Suggestions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries, from medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise efficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these workflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little about the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations succeed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants to examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses to AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated three factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden through required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We collected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four performance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and undercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions about human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI errors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect suggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative outcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest predictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants skeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy, while those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on algorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI collaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who reviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI collaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse evaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>A transport approach to the cutoff phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</description>

      <title>No-Knowledge Alarms for Misaligned LLMs-as-Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be 100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges. The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability requirement.</description>

      <title>Data-driven generative simulation of SDEs using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial analysis and decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS) method and its variant Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting method for solving maximal monotone inclusion problem. We show that BDRS is equivalent to a Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when applied to the dual of the problem. A special case of the Bregman ADMM is an alternating direction version of the exponential multiplier method. To the best of our knowledge, algorithms proposed in this paper are new to the literature. We also discuss how to use our algorithms to solve the discrete optimal transport (OT) problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithms under certain assumptions, though we point out that one assumption does not apply to the OT problem.</description>

      <title>PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>

      <title>Narrative-Guided Reinforcement Learning: A Platform for Studying Language Model Influence on Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a likelihood-free method for comparing two distributions given samples from each, with the goal of assessing the quality of generative models. The proposed approach, PQMass, provides a statistically rigorous method for assessing the performance of a single generative model or the comparison of multiple competing models. PQMass divides the sample space into non-overlapping regions and applies chi-squared tests to the number of data samples that fall within each region, giving a p-value that measures the probability that the bin counts derived from two sets of samples are drawn from the same multinomial distribution. PQMass does not depend on assumptions regarding the density of the true distribution, nor does it rely on training or fitting any auxiliary models. We evaluate PQMass on data of various modalities and dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing the quality, novelty, and diversity of generated samples. We further show that PQMass scales well to moderately high-dimensional data and thus obviates the need for feature extraction in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Computational Trade-offs for Recursive Adaptive Partitioning Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models based on recursive adaptive partitioning such as decision trees and their ensembles are popular for high-dimensional regression as they can potentially avoid the curse of dimensionality. Because empirical risk minimization (ERM) is computationally infeasible, these models are typically trained using greedy algorithms. Although effective in many cases, these algorithms have been empirically observed to get stuck at local optima. We explore this phenomenon in the context of learning sparse regression functions over $d$ binary features, showing that when the true regression function $f^*$ does not satisfy Abbe et al. (2022)'s Merged Staircase Property (MSP), greedy training requires $\exp(\Omega(d))$ to achieve low estimation error. Conversely, when $f^*$ does satisfy MSP, greedy training can attain small estimation error with only $O(\log d)$ samples. This dichotomy mirrors that of two-layer neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the mean-field regime, thereby establishing a head-to-head comparison between SGD-trained neural networks and greedy recursive partitioning estimators. Furthermore, ERM-trained recursive partitioning estimators achieve low estimation error with $O(\log d)$ samples irrespective of whether $f^*$ satisfies MSP, thereby demonstrating a statistical-computational trade-off for greedy training. Our proofs are based on a novel interpretation of greedy recursive partitioning using stochastic process theory and a coupling technique that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference in Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful and accurate method to sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. However, HMC techniques are computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their posterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as variational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to infer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations introduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines inexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify uncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach leverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence of individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a large proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to uncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to significantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed only for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction uncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for posterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator networks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can effectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the operator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in hypersonic flow.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential in probabilistic machine learning models, particularly for assessing the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for estimating both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic models. We focus on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based Gaussian Processes to approximate predictive distributions efficiently. We derive a theoretical formulation for UQ, propose a Monte Carlo sampling-based estimation method, and conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of uncertainty estimation. Our results provide insights into the sources of predictive uncertainty and illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying the confidence in the predictions.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Transformers via Sparse Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have achieved profound success in prediction tasks in a wide range of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision. Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text, images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution robustness and detection.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Set Membership Estimation for Linear Systems with Disturbances Bounded by Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the set membership identification for linear control systems and establishes its convergence rates under relaxed assumptions on (i) the persistent excitation requirement and (ii) the system disturbances. In particular, instead of assuming persistent excitation exactly, this paper adopts the block-martingale small-ball condition enabled by randomly perturbed control policies to establish the convergence rates of SME with high probability. Further, we relax the assumptions on the shape of the bounded disturbance set and the boundary-visiting condition. Our convergence rates hold for disturbances bounded by general convex sets, which bridges the gap between the previous convergence analysis for general convex sets and the existing convergence rate analysis for $\ell_\infty$ balls. Further, we validate our convergence rates by several numerical experiments.

      <title>Generative Example-Based Explanations: Bridging the Gap between Generative Modeling and Explainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several methods have leveraged deep generative modeling to produce example-based explanations of image classifiers. Despite producing visually stunning results, these methods are largely disconnected from classical explainability literature. This conceptual and communication gap leads to misunderstandings and misalignments in goals and expectations. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a probabilistic framework for example-based explanations, formally defining the example-based explanations in a probabilistic manner amenable for modeling via deep generative models while coherent with the critical characteristics and desiderata widely accepted in the explainability community. Our aim is on one hand to provide a constructive framework for the development of well-grounded generative algorithms for example-based explanations and, on the other, to facilitate communication between the generative and explainability research communities, foster rigor and transparency, and improve the quality of peer discussion and research progress in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Simultaneous Equation Models Using Higher-Order Cumulant Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying structural parameters in linear simultaneous-equation models is a longstanding challenge. Recent work exploits information in higher-order moments of non-Gaussian data. In this literature, the structural errors are typically assumed to be uncorrelated so that, after standardizing the covariance matrix of the observables (whitening), the structural parameter matrix becomes orthogonal -- a device that underpins many identification proofs but can be restrictive in econometric applications. We show that neither zero covariance nor whitening is necessary. For any order $h&gt;2$, a simple diagonality condition on the $h$th-order cumulants alone identifies the structural parameter matrix -- up to unknown scaling and permutation -- as the solution to an eigenvector problem; no restrictions on cumulants of other orders are required. This general, single-order result enlarges the class of models covered by our framework and yields a sample-analogue estimator that is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent, asymptotically normal, and easy to compute. Furthermore, when uncorrelatedness is intrinsic -- as in vector autoregressive (VAR) models -- our framework provides a transparent overidentification test. Monte Carlo experiments show favorable finite-sample performance, and two applications -- "Returns to Schooling" and "Uncertainty and the Business Cycle" -- demonstrate its practical value.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Random Features for Operator Learning in Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is the approximation of operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces using machine learning approaches. While most progress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks such as the Deep Operator Network and Fourier Neural Operator, the theoretical guarantees are often in the form of a universal approximation property. However, the existence theorems do not guarantee that an accurate operator network is obtainable in practice. Motivated by the recent kernel-based operator learning framework, we propose a random feature operator learning method with theoretical guarantees and error bounds. The random feature method can be viewed as a randomized approximation of a kernel method, which significantly reduces the computation requirements for training. We provide a generalization error analysis for our proposed random feature operator learning method along with comprehensive numerical results. Compared to kernel-based method and neural network methods, the proposed method can obtain similar or better test errors across benchmarks examples with significantly reduced training times. An additional advantages it that our implementation is simple and does require costly computational resources, such as GPU.</description>

      <title>A Certified Unlearning Approach without Access to Source Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two. \updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in privacy-sensitive settings.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Influence Functions: Accurate Data Attribution in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement. Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with "quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</description>
