      <title>Extreme events in the Lienard system with asymmetric potential: An in-depth exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the dynamics of a forced Lienard oscillator featuring asymmetric potential wells. We provide compelling evidence of extreme events (EE) in the system by manipulating the height of the potential well. In the case of a symmetric well, the system exhibits chaotic behavior, with the trajectory irregularly traversing between the two wells, resulting in frequent large oscillations under specific parameter values. However, the introduction of asymmetry in the potential wells induces a noteworthy transformation. The frequency of jumping between wells is significantly diminished. In essence, the system trajectory displays rare yet recurrent hops to the adjacent well, which we identify as EE. The intricate dynamical behavior observed in the system is elucidated through bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. The emergence of EE in the system, governed by various parameters, is characterized using the threshold height, probability distribution function, and inter-event intervals. We illustrate the regions of EE using phase diagram plots and demonstrate the control of EE by incorporating a damping term into the system.</description>

      <title>Classical and Bohmian trajectories in integrable and non integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the classical and the quantum H\'enon-Heiles systems. In particular we make a comparison between the classical and the quantum trajectories of the integrable and of the non integrable H\'enon Heiles Hamiltonian. From a classical standpoint, we study theoretically and numerically the form of the invariant curves in the Poincar\'e surfaces of section for several values of the coupling parameter of the integrable case and compare them with those of the non integrable case. Then we study the corresponding Bohmian trajectories and we find that they are chaotic in both cases, but chaos emerges at different times.</description>

      <title>Scaling invariance for the diffusion coefficient in a dissipative standard mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unbounded diffusion observed for the standard mapping in a regime of high nonlinearity is suppressed by dissipation due to the violation of Liouville's theorem. The diffusion coefficient becomes important for the description of scaling invariance particularly for the suppression of the unbounded action diffusion. When the dynamics start in the regime of low action, the diffusion coefficient remains constant for a long time, guaranteeing the diffusion for an ensemble of particles. Eventually, it evolves into a regime of decay, marking the suppression of particle action growth. We prove it is scaling invariant for the control parameters and the crossover time identifying the changeover from the constant domain, leading to diffusion, for a regime of decay marking the saturation of the diffusion, scales with the same critical exponent $z=-1$ for a transition from bounded to unbounded diffusion in a dissipative time dependent billiard system.</description>

      <title>Revealing Structure and Symmetry of Nonlinearity in Natural and Engineering Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer across scales is fundamental in fluid dynamics, linking large-scale flow motions to small-scale turbulent structures in engineering and natural environments. Triadic interactions among three wave components form complex networks across scales, challenging understanding and model reduction. We introduce Triadic Orthogonal Decomposition (TOD), a method that identifies coherent flow structures optimally capturing spectral momentum transfer, quantifies their coupling and energy exchange in an energy budget bispectrum, and reveals the regions where they interact. TOD distinguishes three components--a momentum recipient, donor, and catalyst--and recovers laws governing pairwise, six-triad, and global triad conservation. Applied to unsteady cylinder wake and wind turbine wake data, TOD reveals networks of triadic interactions with forward and backward energy transfer across frequencies and scales.</description>

      <title>Trace formula for quantum chaotic systems with geometrical symmetries and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gutzwiller-type trace formula for quantum chaotic systems that accounts for both particle spin precession and discrete geometrical symmetries. This formula generalises previous results that were obtained either for systems with spin [1,2] or for systems with symmetries [3,4], but not for a combination of both. The derivation requires not only a combination of methodologies for these two settings, but also the treatment of new effects in the form of double groups and spin components of symmetry operations. The resulting trace formula expresses the level density of subspectra associated to irreducible representations of the group of unitary symmetries in terms of periodic orbits in the system's fundamental domain. We also derive a corresponding expression for the spectral determinant. In a follow-up paper [5] we will show that our formula allows to study the impact of geometrical symmetries and spin on spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto oscillators in random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of numerical analysis conducted with the aid of the computer, the collective synchronization of coupled phase oscillators in the Kuramoto model in the connected regime of random networks of various sizes is studied. The oscillators synchronize and achieve phase coherence, and this process is not significantly affected by the level of connectivity of the network. If the probability that two oscillators are coupled is around the network connectivity threshold synchronization still occurs, although in a more attenuated way. If the size of the network is sufficiently large the oscillators have a phase transition.</description>
