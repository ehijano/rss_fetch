      <title>Speed of sound peak in two-color dense QCD: confronting effective models with lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice simulations of two-color, two-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite quark chemical potential have revealed a distinctive peak structure in the sound velocity. Although chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model have been employed to explain this phenomenon, neither approach has fully captured the observed behavior. To address this discrepancy, we have extended the NJL framework by incorporating the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS). This approach isolates medium contributions from divergent integrals, allowing for a more accurate treatment of finite-density effects. Our results indicate a clear increase in the diquark gap ($\Delta$) with increasing chemical potential, consistent with what is also seen in perturbative QCD predictions at high densities. {}Furthermore, the MSS-modified NJL model successfully reproduces the observed peak in the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Addressing the $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$ puzzle through New Physics four-fermion operators and their impact on $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow\Lambda_{c}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lepton Flavor Universality ratio $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$ poses a challenge to the Standard Model (SM), as B-factory experiments, BaBar, Belle, and the LHCb show $3.31\sigma$ deviations from their theoretical predictions. Utilizing the latest HFLAV averages and incorporating the branching ratio constraints $60\%$, $30\%$ and $10\%$ from the lifetime of the $B_c$ meson, we determine the values of the Wilson coefficients (WCs) for different New Physics (NP) four-fermion operator with specific Lorentz structures. Our analysis finds that the WC scenario $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$ is the most probable, the maximum pull from the SM, and strongly influenced by branching ratio constraints. Furthermore, we identify three degenerate solutions involving $C_{V_{L}}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, and $C_{S_{R}}^{\prime\prime}$ as the second most probable NP scenarios. We then studied the influence of these NP operators on various physical observables in $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow\Lambda_{c}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decay by using the Lattice QCD form factors. Our results highlighted $C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, $C_{S_{R}}$, $C_{T}$, $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{R}},C_{T}\right)$, and the three degenerate scenarios involving $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{T}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime},C_{T}^{\prime}\right)$ and $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime},C_{T}^{\prime\prime}\right)$ as strong indicators of NP. The correlation of different physical observables shows a direct correlation between $d\Gamma/dq^{2}$ and $P_{L}^{\tau}$ for WC $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$; and between $A_{FB}$ and $P_{L}^{\Lambda_{c}}$ for three degenerate WCs involving $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{T}\right)$. We hope that the measurements of these observables in ongoing and future experiments will help us scrutinize these constraints on the various NP couplings.</description>

      <title>Observation of ballistic plasma and memory in high-energy gauge theory dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The Magic Barrier before Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions - the $\textit{monopoles}$ - proliferate.</description>

      <title>Chimera baryons and mesons on the lattice: a spectral density analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and test a spectral-density analysis method, based on the introduction of smeared energy kernels, to extract physical information from two-point correlation functions computed numerically in lattice field theory. We apply it to a $Sp(4)$ gauge theory and fermion matter fields transforming in distinct representations, with $N_{\rm f}=2$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental and $N_{\rm as}=3$ in the 2-index antisymmetric representation. The corresponding continuum theory provides the minimal candidate model for a composite Higgs boson with partial top compositeness. We consider a broad class of composite operators, that source flavored mesons and (chimera) baryons, for several finite choices of lattice bare parameters. For the chimera baryons, which include candidate top-quark partners, we provide the first measurements, obtained with dynamical fermions, of the ground state and the lowest excited state masses, in all channels of spin, isospin, and parity. We also measure matrix elements and overlap factors, that are important to realize viable models of partial top compositeness, by implementing an innovative way of extracting this information from the spectral densities. For the mesons, among which the pseudoscalars can be reinterpreted to provide an extension of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of particle physics, our measurements of the renormalized matrix elements and decay constants are new results. We complement them with an update of existing measurements of the meson masses, obtained with higher statistics and improved analysis. The analysis software is made publicly available, and can be used in other lattice studies, including application to quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant scalar and vector operators in the $SU\left(2\right)\times U\left(1\right)$ Higgs model: Ward identities and renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach \cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equations used to study $T_{cc}^+$ for a stable $D^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</description>

      <title>Flux tube profile from Holography: finite size and strong coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the holographic correspondence as a tool to study the classical flux tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a $2+1$-dimensional strongly-coupled large $N$ QCD-like theory. The final result extends already known findings in the literature in several ways. First, it is an analytical function of both the space-like boundary coordinates; in other words, we keep track of what happens both along and transversely to the inter-quark axis. Then, we take into account the finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. To the same order, we also confirm the relation between the mass of the lightest glueball in the spectrum and the intrinsic width of the flux tube profile. We conclude by trying to gain some insights about the quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly, our proposal is in agreement with widespread expectations in the literature. En passant, we also derive a semi-analytical formula that gives the first correction to the scalar glueball masses in the strong coupling expansion.</description>
