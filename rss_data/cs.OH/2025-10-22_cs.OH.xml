      <title>STM32-Based IoT Framework for Real-Time Environmental Monitoring and Wireless Node Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fast pace of technological growth has created a heightened need for intelligent, autonomous monitoring systems in a variety of fields, especially in environmental applications. This project shows the design process and implementation of a proper dual node (master-slave) IoT-based monitoring system using STM32F103C8T6 microcontrollers. The structure of the wireless monitoring system studies the environmental conditions in real-time and can measure parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, raindrop detection and obstacle distance. The relay of information occurs between the primary master node (designated as the Green House) to the slave node (the Red House) employing the HC-05 Bluetooth module for information transmission. Each node displays the sensor data on OLED screens and a visual or auditory alert is triggered based on predetermined thresholds. A comparative analysis of STM32 (ARM Cortex-M3) and Arduino (AVR) is presented to justify the STM32 used in this work for greater processing power, less energy use, and better peripherals. Practical challenges in this project arise from power distribution and Bluetooth configuration limits. Future work will explore the transition of a Wi-Fi communication protocol and develop a mobile monitoring robot to enhance scalability of the system. Finally, this research shows that ARM based embedded systems can provide real-time environmental monitoring systems that are reliable and consume low power.</description>

      <title>Optimization research for rescue hot standby EMU location and coverage area in a large-scale high-speed railway network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the extension of China high-speed railway network, the number of railway stations is increasing. The challenge that railway companies are facing is how to reasonably plan the location of hot standby Electric Multiple Units (EMU) and determine the rescue coverage area of each hot standby EMU. It is uneconomical to configure a hot standby EMU for each station. Railway companies want to use the minimum number of hot standby EMUs to provide rescue tasks for the entire high-speed railway network. In this paper, we develop the optimization models for hot standby EMU location and coverage area, respectively. The models aim to maximize the rescue distance and minimize the number of hot standby EMUs. Wha'ts more, in order to reduce the complexity of the models, a method of merging railway lines is used to transform the "point-to-network" to "point-to-point" rescue problem. Two numerical examples are carried to demonstrate the effectiveness of the models. The developed models are linear, and we use Python 3.7 to call Gurobi 9.5.2 to solve the models. In the results, we can find that the developed models can provide an optimal and reasonable plan for the location and coverage area of hot standby EMUs.</description>
