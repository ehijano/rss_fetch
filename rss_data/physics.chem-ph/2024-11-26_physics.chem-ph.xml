      <title>(Electro)catalytic oxidation of sulfide and recovery of elemental sulfur from sulfide-laden streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnxOy coated over TiO2 nanotube array substrate was doped with Mo and polyaniline (PANI) and applied for electrochemical desulfurization of concentrated sulfide (HS) solutions at basic pH, typical of biogas scrubbing solutions and industrial wastewater. Mo and PANI co-dopants significantly enhanced the anode activity towards sulfide oxidation and ensured its complete stability even in highly corrosive sulfide solutions (e.g., 200 mM HS). This was due to the increased electrochemically active surface area, improved coating conductivity and reduced charge transfer resistance. The (electro)catalytic oxidation of HS- demonstrated robust performance with very limited impact of different operational parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, anode potential, HS concentration). Due to the formation of elemental sulfur (S0) layer at the anode surface at basic pH, longer term anode usage requires its periodic removal. Chemical dissolution of S0 with toluene allows its rapid removal without affecting the anode activity, and easy recrystallization and recovery of pure sulfur.</description>

      <title>Balancing property optimization and constraint satisfaction for constrained multi-property molecular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular optimization, which aims to discover improved molecules from a vast chemical search space, is a critical step in chemical development. Various artificial intelligence technologies have demonstrated high effectiveness and efficiency on molecular optimization tasks. However, few of these technologies focus on balancing property optimization with constraint satisfaction, making it difficult to obtain high-quality molecules that not only possess desirable properties but also meet various constraints. To address this issue, we propose a constrained multi-property molecular optimization framework (CMOMO), which is a flexible and efficient method to simultaneously optimize multiple molecular properties while satisfying several drug-like constraints. CMOMO improves multiple properties of molecules with constraints based on dynamic cooperative optimization, which dynamically handles the constraints across various scenarios. Besides, CMOMO evaluates multiple properties within discrete chemical spaces cooperatively with the evolution of molecules within an implicit molecular space to guide the evolutionary search. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed CMOMO over five state-of-the-art molecular optimization methods on two benchmark tasks of simultaneously optimizing multiple non-biological activity properties while satisfying two structural constraints. Furthermore, the practical applicability of CMOMO is verified on two practical tasks, where it identified a collection of candidate ligands of $\beta$2-adrenoceptor GPCR and candidate inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$ with high properties and under drug-like constraints.</description>

      <title>High temperature melting of dense molecular hydrogen from machine-learning interatomic potentials trained on quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results and discuss methods for computing the melting temperature of dense molecular hydrogen using a machine learned model trained on quantum Monte Carlo data. In this newly trained model, we emphasize the importance of accurate total energies in the training. We integrate a two phase method for estimating the melting temperature with estimates from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation to provide a more accurate melting curve from the model. We make detailed predictions of the melting temperature, solid and liquid volumes, latent heat and internal energy from 50 GPa to 180 GPa for both classical hydrogen and quantum hydrogen. At pressures of roughly 173 GPa and 1635K, we observe molecular dissociation in the liquid phase. We compare with previous simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>A constant potential reactor framework for electrochemical reaction simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of electrified solid-liquid interfaces during electrochemical reactions is crucial. However, capturing the dynamic behavior of the interfaces with high temporal resolution and accuracy over long timescales remains a major challenge for both experimental and computational techniques. Here, we present a constant potential reactor framework that enables the simulation of electrochemical reactions with ab initio accuracy over extended timescales, allowing for real-time atomic scale observations for the electrified solid-liquid interface evolution. By implementing an enhanced sampling active learning protocol, we develop fast, accurate, and scalable neural network potentials that generalize across systems with varying electron counts, based on high-throughput density functional theory computations within an explicit-implicit hybrid solvent model. The simulation of reactions in realistic electrochemical environments uncovers the intrinsic mechanisms through which alkali metal cations promote CO2 adsorption and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings align with previous experimental results and clarify previously elusive observations, offering valuable computational insights. Our framework lay the groundwork for future studies exploring the dynamic interplay between interfacial structure and reactivity in electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Observation of a core-excited dipole-bound state $\sim$1 eV above the electron detachment threshold in cryogenically cooled acetylacetonate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole-bound states in anions exist when a polar neutral core binds an electron in a diffuse orbital through charge--dipole interaction. Electronically excited polar neutral cores can also bind an electron in a diffuse orbital to form Core-Excited Dipole-Bound States (CE-DBSs), which are difficult to observe because they usually lie above the electron detachment threshold, leading to very short lifetimes and, thus, unstructured transitions. We report here the photodetachment spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled acetylacetonate anion (C$_5$H$_7$O$_2^-$) recorded by detecting the neutral radical produced upon photodetachment and the infrared spectroscopy in He-nanodroplets. Two DBSs were identified in this anion. One of them lies close to the electron detachment threshold ($\sim$2.74 eV) and is associated with the ground state of the radical (D0-DBS). Surprisingly, the other DBS appears as resonant transitions at 3.69 eV and is assigned to the CE-DBS associated with the first excited state of the radical (D1-DBS). It is proposed that the resonant transitions of the D1-DBS are observed $\sim$1 eV above the detachment threshold because its lifetime is determined by the internal conversion to the D0-DBS, after which the fast electron detachment takes place.</description>

      <title>Variational functional theory for coulombic correlations in the electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical coulombic correlation functional in one-loop (1L) and local-density-approximation (LDA) is derived for electrolyte solutions, starting from a first-principles many-body partition function. The 1L-LDA functional captures correlations between electrolyte ions and solvent dipoles, such as screening and solvation, that are ignored by conventional mean-field theories. This 1L-LDA functional introduces two parameters that can be tuned to the experimental dielectric permittivity and activity coefficients in the bulk electrolyte solution. The capabilities of the 1L-LDA functional for the description of metal-electrolyte interfaces are demonstrated by embedding the functional into a combined quantum-classical model. Here, the 1L-LDA functional leads to a more pronounced double-peak structure of the interfacial capacitance with higher peaks and shorter peak-to-peak distance, significantly improving the agreement with experimental data and showing that electrolyte correlation effects exert a vital impact on the capacitive response.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Prediction of Double Excitation Energies Using the Particle-Particle Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double excitations are crucial to understanding numerous chemical, physical, and biological processes, but accurately predicting them remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) as an efficient and accurate approach for computing double excitation energies. We benchmark ppRPA using various exchange-correlation functionals for 21 molecular systems and two point defect systems. Our results show that ppRPA with functionals containing appropriate amounts of exact exchange provides accuracy comparable to high-level wave function methods such as CCSDT and CASPT2, with significantly reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of ppRPA starting from an excited ($N-2$)-electron state calculated by $\Delta$SCF for the first time, as well as its application to double excitations in bulk periodic systems. These findings suggest that ppRPA is a promising tool for the efficient calculation of double and partial double excitation energies in both molecular and bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Review of the foundations of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is deemed to be a formally rigorous way of dealing with the time-evolution of a many-electron system at the level of electron densities rather than the underlying wavefunctions, which in turn provides an, in principle, exact density-based approach to the treatment of electron excitations in atoms and molecules. This claim has not remained unchallenged, and a detailed account of the relevant criticism is given in this paper. In view of our analysis one has to face the conclusion that there is currently no valid justification for TDDFT, and expectations of finding a remedy here are hardly justified.</description>

      <title>Reflections from the 2024 Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption spectroscopy probes water wire and its ordering in a hydrogen-bond network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water wires, quasi-one-dimensional chains composed of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) water molecules, play a fundamental role in numerous chemical, physical, and physiological processes. Yet direct experimental detection of water wires has been elusive so far. Based on advanced $ab$ $initio$ many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge transfer exciton. In water, the charge transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion batteries. Our analysis establishes optimal-order error estimates for variables in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a novel scale-decoupled solver that balances rapid convergence with reduced memory requirements. Numerical experiments using realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and highlight the superior performance of the proposed solver compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distinctive Electronic Characteristics and Ultra-high Thermoelectric Power Factor in Be-Fe Intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beryllium (Be) alloys are indispensable in cutting-edge applications due to their unique advantages. However, the scientific understanding about their structure and property is deficient, which greatly restricts their applications within a narrow field. In this work, a systematic investigation on the structure and properties of Be-Fe binary was carried out with first-principles unbiased evolutionary algorithms. Five new intermetallics unreported before, including insulating Be11Fe and Be4Fe, metallic Be3Fe, and metastable BeFe and BeFe2 were discovered, among which Be11Fe has a unique clathrate structure and is an electride. Surprisingly, we found that Fe unexpectedly acts as an anion in all known Be-Fe intermetallics, and its valence state can even reach -5, leading to the complete filling of its 3d orbitals. Most of these compounds exhibiting a gap or pseudogap at the Fermi level. Specifically, the band gap is determined as 0.22 eV and 0.85 eV for Be11Fe and Be4Fe at the level of single-shot GW, respectively. This is the first report of insulating phases in Be-based intermetallics. We also discovered that Be11Fe exhibits an impressive thermoelectric power factor of 178 ${\mu}W cm^{-1}K^2$ at room temperature, to our best knowledge, the highest among known semiconductors under ambient conditions, indicating its potential for waste heat harvesting and active cooling. These findings will deepen our understanding of Be-based and Fe-based compounds, and expand the application fields of Be-based alloys to a brand-new realm.</description>

      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Reaction Networks using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a chemical reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, a modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Open Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Neural Network-Based Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Non-Markovian Stochastic Schrodinger Equation (NMSSE) offers a promising approach for open quantum simulations, especially in large systems, owing to its low scaling complexity and suitability for parallel computing. However, its application at low temperatures faces significant convergence challenges. While short-time evolution converges quickly, long-time evolution requires a much larger number of stochastic trajectories, leading to high computational costs. To this end,we propose a scheme that combines neural network techniques with simulations of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equation. By integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs),along with the iterative attentional feature fusion (iAFF) technique, this approach significantly reduces the number of trajectories required for long-time simulations, particularly at low temperatures, thereby substantially lowering computational costs and improving convergence. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the dynamics of the spin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex across a range of parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids: Ionic Liquids for Silicate Material Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids, which are hypo-hydrated room temperature melts of alkali silicates, has created new opportunities for synthesizing porous silicates. Their discovery also allows to reinterpret the role of an ionic liquid for zeolite synthesis and offer unique opportunities to study crystallization in situ. The reduced complexity of HSILs renders them excellent model systems yielding a large space of zeolite phases and framework compositions, and even allowing computer simulations. This work summarizes the impact of alkalinity, hydration, and cation type on silicate speciation and provides physicochemical data spanning relevant temperatures and compositions for zeolite formation. The data is meant as a reference point to further accommodate and verify (computational) models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous velocity distributions in slow quantum-tunneling chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work [Wild et al., Nature 615, 425 (2023)] has provided an experimental break-through in the realization of a quantum-tunneling reaction involving a proton transfer. The reaction $D^-+H_2 \to H^-+HD$ has an extremely slow reaction rate as it can happen only via quantum tunneling, thus requiring an extremely large density of the reactants in the ion trap. At these high densities strong deviations from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics are observed. Here we develop a consistent generalized statistical mechanics theory for the above nonequilibrium situation involving quantum effects at high densities. The trapped ions are treated in a superstatistical way and a $q$-Maxwellian velocity distribution with a universal dependence of the entropic index $q$ on the density $n$ of the buffer gas is derived. We show that the velocity distribution of the ions is non-Maxwellian, more precisely $q$-Gaussian, i.e., $p(v) \propto v^2 [1+(q-1)\tilde{\beta} v^2]^{1/(1-q)}$, with entropic index $q&gt;1$ depending on the density $n$ of $H_2$ molecules, in excellent agreement with the experimental observations of Wild et al. Our theory also makes predictions on the statistics of temperature fluctuations in the ion trap which can be tested in future experiments. Through the superstatistical approach, we obtain an analytical expression for $q(n)$ which is consistent with the available experimental data, and which yields $\lim_{n\to 0}q(n)=1$, i.e. recovering the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the ideal gas limit, as well as $\lim_{n\to\infty}q(n)=7/5$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Methodology for Modelling First and Second Order Phase Transformations -- Thermodynamic Aspects, Variational Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the mathematical modelling of first and second order phase transformations. It will be shown that this methodology can be related to certain limiting cases of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, specifically the cases of having (i) a convex molar free energy function and (ii) a convex molar free energy function with no regularization. The latter case is commonly regarded as unstable; however, by modifying the variational approach and solving for rate-dependent variables, we obtain a stabilized method capable of handling the missing regularization. While the specific numerical method used to solve the equations (a mixed finite element approach) has been previously employed in related contexts (e.g., to stabilize solutions of the Laplace equation), its application to diffusion and diffusional phase transformations is novel. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases. Our work contributes to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <title>Why Do Weak-Binding M-N-C Single-Atom Catalysts Possess Anomalously High Oxygen Reduction Activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) structures are widely recognized as promising candidates in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). According to the classical Sabatier principle, optimal 3d metal catalysts, such as Fe/Co-N-C, achieve superior catalytic performance due to the moderate binding strength. However, the substantial ORR activity demonstrated by weakly binding M-N-C catalysts such as NiCu-N-C challenges current understandings, emphasizing the need to explore new underlying mechanisms. In this work, we integrated a pH-field coupled microkinetic model with detailed experimental electron state analyses to verify a novel key step in the ORR reaction pathway of weak-binding SACs-the oxygen adsorption at the metal-N bridge site. This step significantly altered the adsorption scaling relations, electric field responses, and solvation effects, further impacting the key kinetic reaction barrier from HOO* to O* and pH-dependent performance. Synchrotron spectra analysis further provides evidence for the new weak-binding M-N-C model, showing an increase in electron density on the anti-bonding pi orbitals of N atoms in weak-binding M-N-C catalysts and confirming the presence of N-O bonds. These findings redefine the understanding of weak-binding M-N-C catalyst behavior, opening up new perspectives for their application in clean energy.</description>

Abstract: We present an implementation of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for periodic systems using GPU accelerated QM methods, a distributed multipole formulation of the electrostatics, and a pseudo-bond treatment of the QM/MM boundary. We demonstrate that our method has well-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and energy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic kinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional reparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight the sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum region selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through the open-source \textsc{PySCF} package using acceleration from the \textsc{GPU4PySCF} module.</description>

      <title>SDSPT2s: SDSPT2 with Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an approximation to SDSCI [static-dynamic-static (SDS) configuration interaction (CI), a minimal MRCI; Theor. Chem. Acc. 133, 1481 (2014)], SDSPT2 [Mol. Phys. 115, 2696 (2017)] is a CI-like multireference (MR) second-order perturbation theory (PT2) that treats single and multiple roots on an equal footing. This feature permits the use of configuration selection over a large complete active space (CAS) $P$ to end up with a much reduced reference space $\tilde{P}$, which is connected only with a portion ($\tilde{Q}_1$) of the full first-order interacting space $Q$ connected to $P$. The effective interacting $\tilde{Q}$ space can further be truncated by an integral-based cutoff threshold. With marginal loss of accuracy, the selection-truncation procedure, along with an efficient evaluation and storage of internal contraction coefficients, renders SDSPT2s (SDSPT2 with selection) applicable to systems that cannot be handled by the parent CAS-based SDSPT2, as demonstrated by several challenging showcases.</description>

      <title>Discovery of magnetic field line dependent anisotropic chemiresistive response in Magnetite: A new piece to the puzzle of magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemiresistive materials, which alter their electrical resistance in response to interactions with surrounding chemicals, are valued for their robustness, rapid detection ability and high sensitivity. Recent research has revealed that the sensing performance of these materials can be enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. In this study, we report a novel finding in the chemiresistive behavior of magnetite (Fe3O4), where its response has been found to be modulated in an anisotropic manner when exposed to an external magnetic field, analogous to Earth's magnetic field. Remarkably, substantial variations have been observed in response to analytes naturally present in the atmosphere. This chemiresistive response exhibits a strong anisotropic dependence on the strength, direction and inclination of the magnetic field, suggesting that magnetite's electrical resistance dynamically adapts to both magnetic and chemical environmental changes. The observed behavior under Earth-like magnetic field closely mirrors the magnetoreception seen in migratory species that rely on magnetite for navigation. This finding may provide new insights into the mechanisms behind magnetite-based magnetoreception observed in various biological species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the interfacial free energy along the coexistence line from single-state calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the interfacial free energy between two thermodynamic phases is crucial across various fields, including materials science, chemistry, and condensed matter physics. In this study, we apply an existing thermodynamic approach, the Gibbs-Cahn integration method, to determine the interfacial free energy under different coexistence conditions, relying on data from a single-state calculation at specified pressure and temperature. This approach developed by Laird et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 114110 (2009)] reduces computational demand and enhances efficiency compared to methods that require separate measurements at each thermodynamic state. The integration scheme computes the excess interfacial free energy using unbiased NVT simulations, where the two phases coexist, to provide input for the calculations. We apply this method to the Lennard-Jones and mW water models for liquid-solid interfaces, as well as the Lennard-Jones and TIP4P/2005 models for liquid-vapor interfaces. Our results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of this integration route for estimating the interfacial free energy along a coexistence line.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>
