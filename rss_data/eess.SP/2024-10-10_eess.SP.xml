      <title>Performance Analysis of Local Partial MMSE Precoding Based User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems and Deployment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, leveraging tight cooperation among wireless access points, exhibit remarkable signal enhancement and interference suppression capabilities, demonstrating significant performance advantages over traditional cellular networks. This paper investigates the performance and deployment optimization of a user-centric scalable cell-free massive MIMO system with imperfect channel information over correlated Rayleigh fading channels. Based on the large-dimensional random matrix theory, this paper presents the deterministic equivalent of the ergodic sum rate for this system when applying the local partial minimum mean square error (LP-MMSE) precoding method, along with its derivative with respect to the channel correlation matrix. Furthermore, utilizing the derivative of the ergodic sum rate, this paper designs a Barzilai-Borwein based gradient descent method to improve system deployment. Simulation experiments demonstrate that under various parameter settings and large-scale antenna configurations, the deterministic equivalent of the ergodic sum rate accurately approximates the Monte Carlo ergodic sum rate of the system. Furthermore, the deployment optimization algorithm effectively enhances the ergodic sum rate of this system by optimizing the positions of access points.</description>

      <title>A Novel Low-Complexity Peak-Power-Assisted Data-Aided Channel Estimation Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, for the first time, presents a low-complexity peak-power-assisted data-aided channel estimation (DACE) scheme for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) wireless systems. In OFDM, high peak-power levels occur when the subcarriers align in phase and constructively interfere with each other. The research proposes a peak-power-assisted channel estimation scheme that accurately selects peak-power carriers at the transmitter of an OFDM system and uses them as reliable carriers for the DACE scheme. By incorporating these reliable carriers with known pilot symbols as additional pilot signals, channel estimation accuracy significantly improves in MIMO-OFDM systems. This eliminates the need to determine reliable data symbols at the receiver, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity of the system. However, high peak-powers are considered a major drawback in OFDM. In this work, we incorporate a companding technique to mitigate this issue and provide sufficient margin for the DACE scheme. The performance of the proposed DACE scheme is evaluated using both least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimators. In this regard, the proposed technique not only improves channel estimation accuracy but also enhances the spectral efficiency of the wireless system. It outperforms traditional channel estimators in terms of system mean square error (MSE) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance. It also reduces the pilot overhead by 50$\%$ compared to traditional channel estimators and provides bandwidth optimization for MIMO-OFDM systems. This makes it a promising solution for improving the performance and efficiency of wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Radio Map-assisted CSI Tracking with Uncertain Locations in Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05803v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet efficient and accurate channel state information (CSI) tracking remains a key challenge, particularly in dynamic urban settings. To address this, we propose a radio mapassisted framework for CSI tracking and trajectory discovery, relying on sparse channel observations. The radio map is redefined as a mapping from spatial positions to deterministic channel covariance matrices, which captures the complex and time-varying characteristics of urban wireless environments. Leveraging these covariance maps, we develop a CSI tracking method that enables accurate estimation using only single-dimensional observations collected during user movement. Furthermore, we present an efficient algorithm that constructs and continuously refines the radio map through sequential sparse observations, even when location labels are uncertain. Numerical results based on real city maps and ray-tracing MIMO channel datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the long-range and wireless interrogation of multiple chipless sensors from the isoline processing of three-dimensional polarimetric radar images. A Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave Radar operating at 24 GHz is used for the indoor interrogation of four sensors in the basement of a Laboratory.

      <title>Improved PCRLB for radar tracking in clutter with geometry-dependent target measurement uncertainty and application to radar trajectory control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In realistic radar tracking, target measurement uncertainty (TMU) in terms of both detection probability and measurement error covariance is significantly affected by the target-to-radar (T2R) geometry. However, existing posterior Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (PCRLBs) rarely investigate the fundamental impact of T2R geometry on target measurement uncertainty and eventually on mean square error (MSE) of state estimate, inevitably resulting in over-conservative lower bound. To address this issue, this paper firstly derives the generalized model of target measurement error covariance for bistatic radar with moving receiver and transmitter illuminating any type of signal, along with its approximated solution to specify the impact of T2R geometry on error covariance. Based upon formulated TMU model, an improved PCRLB (IPCRLB) fully accounting for both measurement origin uncertainty and geometry-dependent TMU is then re-derived, both detection probability and measurement error covariance are treated as state-dependent parameters when differentiating log-likelihood with respect to target state. Compared to existing PCRLBs that partially or completely ignore the dependence of target measurement uncertainty on T2R geometry, proposed IPCRLB provides a much accurate (less-conservative) lower bound for radar tracking in clutter with geometry-dependent TMU. The new bound is then applied to radar trajectory control to effectively optimize T2R geometry and exhibits least uncertainty of acquired target measurement and more accurate state estimate for bistatic radar tracking in clutter, compared to state-of-the-art trajectory control methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Enhanced Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Client-Driven Power Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel privacy-enhanced over-the-air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) framework using client-driven power balancing (CDPB) to address privacy concerns in OTA-FL systems. In recent studies, a server determines the power balancing based on the continuous transmission of channel state information (CSI) from each client. Furthermore, they concentrate on fulfilling privacy requirements in every global iteration, which can heighten the risk of privacy exposure as the learning process extends. To mitigate these risks, we propose two CDPB strategies -- CDPB-n (noisy) and CDPB-i (idle) -- allowing clients to adjust transmission power independently, without sharing CSI. CDPB-n transmits noise during poor conditions, while CDPB-i pauses transmission until conditions improve. To further enhance privacy and learning efficiency, we show a mixed strategy, CDPB-mixed, which combines CDPB-n and CDPB-i. Our experimental results show that CDPB outperforms traditional approaches in terms of model accuracy and privacy guarantees, providing a practical solution for enhancing OTA-FL in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Design for Movable Antennas Enabled-Multiuser MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), which can be swiftly repositioned within a defined region, offer a promising solution to the limitations of fixed-position antennas (FPAs) in adapting to spatial variations in wireless channels, thereby improving channel conditions and communication between transceivers. However, frequent MA position adjustments based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) incur high operational complexity, making real-time CSI acquisition impractical, especially in fast-fading channels. To address these challenges, we propose a two-timescale transmission framework for MA-enabled multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In the large timescale, statistical CSI is exploited to optimize MA positions for long-term ergodic performance, whereas, in the small timescale, beamforming vectors are designed using instantaneous CSI to handle short-term channel fluctuations. Within this new framework, we analyze the ergodic sum rate and develop efficient MA position optimization algorithms for both maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. These algorithms employ alternating optimization (AO), successive convex approximation (SCA), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques, iteratively optimizing antenna positions and refining surrogate functions that approximate the ergodic sum rate. Numerical results show significant ergodic sum rate gains with the proposed two-timescale MA design over conventional FPA systems, particularly under moderate to strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. Notably, MA with ZF beamforming consistently outperforms MA with MRT, highlighting the synergy between beamforming and MAs for superior interference management in environments with moderate Rician factors and high user density, while MA with MRT can offer a simplified alternative to complex beamforming designs in strong LoS conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document, we revise the results of [1] based on more reasonable assumptions regarding data shuffling and parameter setup of deep neural networks (DNNs). Thus, the simulation results can now more reasonably demonstrate the performance of both the proposed and compared beam alignment methods. We revise the simulation steps and make moderate modifications to the design of the vehicle distribution feature (VDF) for the proposed vision based beam alignment when the MS location is available (VBALA). Specifically, we replace the 2D grids of the VDF with 3D grids and utilize the vehicle locations to expand the dimensions of the VDF. Then, we revise the simulation results of Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 in [1] to reaffirm the validity of the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy Efficiency with RSMA: Balancing Low and High QoS Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless systems are expected to deliver significantly higher quality-of-service (QoS) albeit with fewer energy resources for diverse, already existing and also novel wireless applications. The optimal resource allocation for a system in this regard could be investigated by reducing the overall power available at the expense of reduced QoS for the inefficient users. In other words, we maximize the system energy efficiency by achieving power saving through a minimal back-off in terms of QoS. In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency vs. delivered QoS trade-off for the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) assisted downlink system. We first determine the user grouping with a normalised channel similarity metric so as to allow a large number of users with non-zero achievable private message rates. Through the private message removal (PMR) of these users, we aim to investigate the QoS vs. energy efficiency trade-off. Numerical results indicate a peak of ~$10\%$ increase in the network energy efficiency for the proposed normalised channel similarity metric based user grouping with scheduled PMR.</description>

      <title>A Physical Layer Security Framework for Integrated Sensing and Semantic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a physical layer security (PLS) framework for the integrated sensing and semantic communication (ISASC) system, where a multi-antenna dual-function semantic base station serves multiple single-antenna semantic communication users (SCUs) and monitors a malicious sensing target (MST), in the presence of a single-antenna eavesdropper (EVE), with both the MST and EVE aiming to wiretap information from the SCUs' signals. To enhance PLS, we employ joint artificial noise (AN) and dedicated sensing signal (DSS) in addition to wiretap coding. To evaluate the sensing accuracy, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as a function of the communication, sensing, and AN beamforming (BF) vectors. Subsequently, to assess the PLS level of the ISASC system, we determine a closed-form expression for the semantic secrecy rate (SSR). To achieve an optimal trade-off region between these two competing objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem for the joint design of the BF vectors. We apply semi-definite programming, Gaussian randomization method, and golden-section search techniques to address this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes, achieving a superior trade-off between SSR and CRB.</description>

      <title>A New Architecture for Neural Enhanced Multiobject Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in robotics, autonomous driving, and maritime surveillance. Traditional work on MOT is model-based and aims to establish algorithms in the framework of sequential Bayesian estimation. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. The two approaches have demonstrated advantages in certain scenarios. In particular, in problems where plenty of labeled data for the training of neural networks is available, data-driven MOT tends to have advantages compared to traditional methods. A natural thought is whether a general and efficient framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper advances a recently introduced hybrid model-based and data-driven method called neural-enhanced belief propagation (NEBP). Compared to existing work on NEBP for MOT, it introduces a novel neural architecture that can improve data association and new object initialization, two critical aspects of MOT. The proposed tracking method is leading the nuScenes LiDAR-only tracking challenge at the time of submission of this paper.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) for Mobile Communications: A Diffusion Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article targets at unlocking the potentials of a class of prominent generative artificial intelligence (GAI) method, namely diffusion model (DM), for mobile communications. First, a DM-driven communication architecture is proposed, which introduces two key paradigms, i.e., conditional DM and DMdriven deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for wireless data generation and communication management, respectively. Then, we discuss the key advantages of DM-driven communication paradigms. To elaborate further, we explore DM-driven channel generation mechanisms for channel estimation, extrapolation, and feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We showcase the numerical performance of conditional DM using the accurate DeepMIMO channel datasets, revealing its superiority in generating high-fidelity channels and mitigating unforeseen distribution shifts in sophisticated scenes. Furthermore, several DM-driven communication management designs are conceived, which is promising to deal with imperfect channels and taskoriented communications. To inspire future research developments, we highlight the potential applications and open research challenges of DM-driven communications.

      <title>Reliable Heading Tracking for Pedestrian Road Crossing Prediction Using Commodity Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian heading tracking enables applications in pedestrian navigation, traffic safety, and accessibility. Previous works, using inertial sensor fusion or machine learning, are limited in that they assume the phone is fixed in specific orientations, hindering their generalizability. We propose a new heading tracking algorithm, the Orientation-Heading Alignment (OHA), which leverages a key insight: people tend to carry smartphones in certain ways due to habits, such as swinging them while walking. For each smartphone attitude during this motion, OHA maps the smartphone orientation to the pedestrian heading and learns such mappings efficiently from coarse headings and smartphone orientations. To anchor our algorithm in a practical scenario, we apply OHA to a challenging task: predicting when pedestrians are about to cross the road to improve road user safety. In particular, using 755 hours of walking data collected since 2020 from 60 individuals, we develop a lightweight model that operates in real-time on commodity devices to predict road crossings. Our evaluation shows that OHA achieves 3.4 times smaller heading errors across nine scenarios than existing methods. Furthermore, OHA enables the early and accurate detection of pedestrian crossing behavior, issuing crossing alerts 0.35 seconds, on average, before pedestrians enter the road range.</description>

      <title>Open loop calibration and closed loop non-perturbative estimation of the lateral errors of an adaptive optics system: examples with GRAVITY+ and CHARA experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performances of an adaptive optics (AO) system are directly linked with the quality of its alignment. During the instrument calibration, having open loop fast tools with a large capture range are necessary to quickly assess the system misalignment and to drive it towards a state allowing to close the AO loop. During operation, complex systems are prone to misalignments (mechanical flexions, rotation of optical elements, etc.) that potentially degrade the AO performances, creating a need for a monitoring tool to tackle their driftage. In this work, we first present an improved perturbative method to quickly assess large lateral errors in open loop. It uses the spatial correlation of the measured interaction matrix of a limited number of 2D spatial modes with a synthetic model. Then, we introduce a novel solution to finely measure and correct these lateral errors via the closed loop telemetry. Non-perturbative, this method consequently does not impact the science output of the instrument. It is based on the temporal correlation of 2D spatial frequencies in the deformable mirror commands. It is model-free (no need of an interaction matrix model) and sparse in the Fourier space, making it fast and easily scalable to complex systems such as future extremely large telescopes. Finally, we present some results obtained on the development bench of the GRAVITY+ extreme AO system (Cartesian grid, 1432 actuators). In addition, we show with on-sky results gathered with CHARA and GRAVITY/CIAO that the method is adaptable to non-conventional AO geometries (hexagonal grids, 60 actuators).</description>

      <title>Two Birds With One Stone: Enhancing Communication and Sensing via Multi-Functional RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose new network architectures that integrate multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RISs) into 6G networks to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Firstly, we elaborate how to leverage MF-RISs for improving communication performance in different communication modes including unicast, mulitcast, and broadcast and for different multi-access schemes. Next, we emphasize synergistic benefits of integrating MF-RISs with wireless sensing, enabling more accurate and efficient target detection in 6G networks. Furthermore, we present two schemes that utilize MF-RISs to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We also study multi-objective optimization to achieve the optimal trade-off between communication and sensing performance. Finally, we present numerical results to show the performance improvements offered by MF-RISs compared to conventional RISs in ISAC. We also outline key research directions for MF-RIS under the ambition of 6G.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Circadian Rhythm of Cats Living in a Group using Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the biological rhythms of domestic cats. Twelve cats from the AVA shelter in Cuy-Saint-Fiacre, France, participated in the experimental study, wearing collars equipped with IMU sensors for about three weeks. Recorded data were analyzed to measure the cats activity and to gain further insights into their biological rhythms. We first determined the time budget of the cats by categorizing behavior into inactivity and activity. Next, we analyzed the day/night activity repartition and the hourly distribution of activity. Results showed an average of 14.5% of global activity and a higher activity during the day in comparison with the night. Moreover, a bimodal activity pattern with increased activity at the time of the caretaker's interventions at feeding time was found.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal algorithms for the recovery of low-dimensional models with linear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from linear measurements. From signal and image processing to inverse problems in data science, this question has been at the center of many applications. Lately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks leading to non-convex formulations, traditional convex variational approaches have shown their limits. Furthermore, the multiplication of algorithms and recovery results makes identifying the best methods a complex task. In this article, we study recovery with a class of widely used algorithms without considering any underlying functional. This result leads to a class of projected gradient descent algorithms that recover a given low-dimensional with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality of the measurements with respect to the model from its intrinsic complexity. As a consequence, we can directly measure the performance of this class of projected gradient descents through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection. By optimizing this constant, we define optimal algorithms. Our general approach provides an optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, we uncover underlying linear rates of convergence for some ''plug and play'' imaging methods relying on deep priors by interpreting our results in this context, thus linking low-dimensional recovery and recovery with deep priors under a unified theory, validated by experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted D2D Communication in the Presence of Interference: Outage Performance Analysis and DNN-Based Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communication systems, focusing on addressing co-channel interference, a prevalent issue due to the frequency reuse of sidelink in the underlay in-band D2D communications. In contrast to previous studies that either neglect interference or consider it only at the user, our research investigates a performance analysis in terms of outage probability (OP) for RIS-assisted D2D communication systems considering the presence of interference at both the user and the RIS. More specifically, we introduce a novel integral-form expression for an exact analysis of OP. Additionally, we present a new accurate approximation expression for OP, using the gamma distributions to approximate the fading of both desired and interference links, thereby yielding a closed-form expression. Nevertheless, both derived expressions, i.e., the exact integral-form and the approximate closed-form, contain special functions, such as Meijer's G-function and the parabolic cylinder function, which complicate real-time OP analysis. To circumvent this, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) for real-time OP prediction, trained with data generated by the exact expression. Moreover, we present a tight upper bound that quantifies the impact of interference on achievable diversity order and coding gain. We validate the derived expressions through Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis reveals that while interference does not affect the system's diversity order, it significantly degrades the performance by reducing the coding gain. The results further demonstrate that increasing the number of RIS's reflecting elements is an effective strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of the interference on the system performance.</description>

      <title>Point-to-Point MIMO Channel Estimation by Exploiting Array Geometry and Clustered Multipath Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large-scale MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system offers significant advantages in wireless communication, including potential spatial multiplexing and beamforming capabilities. However, channel estimation becomes challenging with multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends. The minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator, for instance, requires a spatial correlation matrix whose dimensions scale with the square of the product of the number of antennas on the transmitter and receiver sides. This scaling presents a substantial challenge, particularly as antenna counts increase in line with current technological trends. Traditional MIMO literature offers alternative channel estimators that mitigate the need to fully acquire the spatial correlation matrix. In this paper, we revisit point-to-point MIMO channel estimation and introduce a reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) channel estimator designed to eliminate physically impossible channel dimensions inherent in uniform planar arrays. Additionally, we propose a cluster-aware RS-LS estimator that leverages both reduced and cluster-specific subspace properties, significantly enhancing performance over the conventional RS-LS approach. Notably, both proposed methods obviate the need for fully/partial knowledge of the spatial correlation matrix.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted ISAC: Precoding and Phase-Shift Optimization for Mono-Static Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology emerges as a highly useful component of the rapidly evolving integrated sensing and communications paradigm, primarily owing to its remarkable signal-to-noise ratio enhancement capabilities. In this paper, our focus is on mono-static target detection while considering the communication requirement of a user equipment. Both sensing and communication benefit from the presence of an RIS, which makes the channels richer and stronger. Diverging from prior research, we comprehensively examine three target echo paths: the direct (static) channel path, the path via the RIS, and a combination of these, each characterized by distinct radar cross sections (RCSs). We take both the line-of-sight (LOS) and the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths into account under a clutter for which the distribution is not known, but the low-rank subspace it resides. We derive the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector and introduce a novel approach for jointly optimizing the configuration of RIS phase-shifts and precoding. Our simulation results underscore the paramount importance of this combined design in terms of enhancing detection probability. Moreover, it becomes evident that the derived clutter-aware target detection significantly enhances detection performance, especially when the clutter is strong.</description>

      <title>Balanced Space- and Time-based Duty-cycle Scheduling for Light-based IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Multiple Access Control (MAC) protocol for Light-based IoT (LIoT) networks, where the gateway node orchestrates and schedules batteryless nodes duty-cycles based on their location and sleep time. The LIoT concept represents a sustainable solution for massive indoor IoT applications, offering an alternative communication medium through Visible Light Communication (VLC). While most existing scheduling algorithms for intermittent batteryless IoT aim to maximize data collection and enhance dataset size, our solution is tailored for environmental sensing applications, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality monitoring, optimizing measurement distribution and minimizing blind spots to achieve comprehensive and uniform environmental sensing. We propose a Balanced Space and Time-based Time Division Multiple Access scheduling (BST-TDMA) algorithm, which addresses environmental sensing challenges by balancing spatial and temporal factors to improve the environmental sensing efficiency of batteryless LIoT nodes. Our measurement-based results show that BST-TDMA was able to efficiently schedule duty-cycles with given intervals.</description>

      <title>Optimized Resource Allocation for Cloud-Native 6G Networks: Zero-Touch ML Models in Microservices-based VNF Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G, the next generation of mobile networks, is set to offer even higher data rates, ultra-reliability, and lower latency than 5G. New 6G services will increase the load and dynamism of the network. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aids with this increased load and dynamism by eliminating hardware dependency. It aims to boost the flexibility and scalability of network deployment services by separating network functions from their specific proprietary forms so that they can run as virtual network functions (VNFs) on commodity hardware. It is essential to design an NFV orchestration and management framework to support these services. However, deploying bulky monolithic VNFs on the network is difficult, especially when underlying resources are scarce, resulting in ineffective resource management. To address this, microservices-based NFV approaches are proposed. In this approach, monolithic VNFs are decomposed into micro VNFs, increasing the likelihood of their successful placement and resulting in more efficient resource management. This article discusses the proposed framework for resource allocation for microservices-based services to provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) using the Double Deep Q Learning (DDQL) approach. Furthermore, to enhance this resource allocation approach, we discussed and addressed two crucial sub-problems: the need for a dynamic priority technique and the presence of the low-priority starvation problem. Using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) model, an Adaptive Scheduling model is developed that effectively mitigates the starvation problem. Additionally, the impact of incorporating traffic load considerations into deployment and scheduling is thoroughly investigated.</description>

      <title>Towards xAI: Configuring RNN Weights using Domain Knowledge for MIMO Receive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is making a profound impact in the physical layer of wireless communications. Despite exhibiting outstanding empirical performance in tasks such as MIMO receive processing, the reasons behind the demonstrated superior performance improvement remain largely unclear. In this work, we advance the field of Explainable AI (xAI) in the physical layer of wireless communications utilizing signal processing principles. Specifically, we focus on the task of MIMO-OFDM receive processing (e.g., symbol detection) using reservoir computing (RC), a framework within recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which outperforms both conventional and other learning-based MIMO detectors. Our analysis provides a signal processing-based, first-principles understanding of the corresponding operation of the RC. Building on this fundamental understanding, we are able to systematically incorporate the domain knowledge of wireless systems (e.g., channel statistics) into the design of the underlying RNN by directly configuring the untrained RNN weights for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection. The introduced RNN weight configuration has been validated through extensive simulations demonstrating significant performance improvements. This establishes a foundation for explainable RC-based architectures in MIMO-OFDM receive processing and provides a roadmap for incorporating domain knowledge into the design of neural networks for NextG systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication is critical for the non-invasive in-situ monitoring of vital signs in deep tissues. Wireless ultrasonic links demonstrated so far solved the shortcomings of electromagnetic wave-based communication methods. However, they either require highly customized and complex designs for the implant electronics or rely on physical changes in implanted metamaterials. Here, we report a wireless, passive, frequency-based, and electronics-free ultrasonic communication method for deep tissue sensor implants. The device consists of a piezoelectric crystal used as the ultrasonic antenna, considerably simplifying the implant design, and can be integrated with any capacitive implantable sensor. We demonstrate the applicability of the passive communication method using a commercial pressure sensor at a depth of 5 cm with decent precision and accuracy.</description>

      <title>On Broad-Beam Reflection for Dual-Polarized RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for aiding user-specific transmission has been widely explored. However, little attention has been devoted to utilizing RIS for assisting cell-specific transmission, where the RIS needs to reflect signals in a broad angular range. Furthermore, although modern communication systems operate in two polarizations, the majority of the works on RIS consider a uni-polarized surface, only reflecting the signals in one polarization. To fill these gaps, we study a downlink broadcasting scenario where a base station (BS) sends a cell-specific signal to all the users residing at unknown locations with the assistance of a dual-polarized RIS. We utilize the duality between the auto-correlation function and power spectrum in the space/spatial frequency domain to design configurations for broad-beam reflection. We first consider a free-space line-of-sight BS-RIS channel and show that the RIS configuration matrices must form a Golay complementary array pair for broad-beam radiation. We also present how to form Golay complementary array pairs based on known Golay complementary sequence pairs. We then consider an arbitrary BS-RIS channel and propose an algorithm based on stochastic optimization to find RIS configurations that produce a practically broad beam by relaxing the requirement on uniform broadness. Numerical simulations are finally conducted to corroborate the analyses and evaluate the performance.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Unsupervised Audio-visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised audiovisual speech enhancement (AVSE) approach that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to iteratively estimate clean speech. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervisedgenerative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.</description>

Abstract: The Prototypical Network (ProtoNet) has emerged as a popular choice in Few-shot Learning (FSL) scenarios due to its remarkable performance and straightforward implementation. Building upon such success, we first propose a simple (yet novel) method to fine-tune a ProtoNet on the (labeled) support set of the test episode of a C-way-K-shot test episode (without using the query set which is only used for evaluation). We then propose an algorithmic framework that combines ProtoNet with optimization-based FSL algorithms (MAML and Meta-Curvature) to work with such a fine-tuning method. Since optimization-based algorithms endow the target learner model with the ability to fast adaption to only a few samples, we utilize ProtoNet as the target model to enhance its fine-tuning performance with the help of a specifically designed episodic fine-tuning strategy. The experimental results confirm that our proposed models, MAML-Proto and MC-Proto, combined with our unique fine-tuning method, outperform regular ProtoNet by a large margin in few-shot audio classification tasks on the ESC-50 and Speech Commands v2 datasets. We note that although we have only applied our model to the audio domain, it is a general method and can be easily extended to other domains.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Decoding of Linear Block Codes for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to its superior features of fast read/write speed and low power consumption, spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) has become a promising non-volatile memory (NVM) technology that is suitable for many applications. However, the reliability of STT-MRAM is seriously affected by the variation of the memory fabrication process and the working temperature, and the later will lead to an unknown offset of the channel. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop more effective error correction coding techniques to tackle these imperfections and improve the reliability of STT-MRAM. In this work, we propose, for the first time, the application of deep-learning (DL) based algorithms and techniques to improve the decoding performance of linear block codes with short codeword lengths for STT-MRAM. We formulate the belief propagation (BP) decoding of linear block code as a neural network (NN), and propose a novel neural normalized-offset reliability-based min-sum (NNORB-MS) decoding algorithm. We successfully apply our proposed decoding algorithm to the STT-MRAM channel through channel symmetrization to overcome the channel asymmetry. We also propose an NN-based soft information generation method (SIGM) to take into account the unknown offset of the channel. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed NNORB-MS decoding algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over both the hard-decision decoding (HDD) and the regular reliability-based min-sum (RB-MS) decoding algorithm, for cases without and with the unknown channel offset. Moreover, the decoder structure and time complexity of the NNORB-MS algorithm remain similar to those of the regular RB-MS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Deep Transfer Learning-based Detection for Flash Memory Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NAND flash memory channel is corrupted by different types of noises, such as the data retention noise and the wear-out noise, which lead to unknown channel offset and make the flash memory channel non-stationary. In the literature, machine learning-based methods have been proposed for data detection for flash memory channels. However, these methods require a large number of training samples and labels to achieve a satisfactory performance, which is costly. Furthermore, with a large unknown channel offset, it may be impossible to obtain enough correct labels. In this paper, we reformulate the data detection for the flash memory channel as a transfer learning (TL) problem. We then propose a model-based deep TL (DTL) algorithm for flash memory channel detection. It can effectively reduce the training data size from $10^6$ samples to less than 104 samples. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based DTL algorithm using moment alignment, which can detect data without any labels. Hence, it is suitable for scenarios where the decoding of error-correcting code fails and no labels can be obtained. Finally, a UDA-based threshold detector is proposed to eliminate the need for a neural network. Both the channel raw error rate analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DTL-based detection schemes can achieve near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance with much less training data and/or without using any labels.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports a preliminary study on quantitative frequency domain rhythm cues for classifying five Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, and Tamil. We employ rhythm formant (R-formants) analysis, a technique introduced by Gibbon that utilizes low-frequency spectral analysis of amplitude modulation and frequency modulation envelopes to characterize speech rhythm. Various measures are computed from the LF spectrum, including R-formants, discrete cosine transform-based measures, and spectral measures. Results show that threshold-based and spectral features outperform directly computed R-formants. Temporal pattern of rhythm derived from LF spectrograms provides better language-discriminating cues. Combining all derived features we achieve an accuracy of 69.21% and a weighted F1 score of 69.18% in classifying the five languages. This study demonstrates the potential of RFA in characterizing speech rhythm for Indian language classification.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop phase selection in EEG-TMS using Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with encephalography feedback (EEG-TMS) has shown that the phase of the sensorimotor mu rhythm is predictive of corticospinal excitability. Thus, if the subject-specific optimal phase is known, stimulation can be timed to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a closed-loop algorithm to determine the optimal phase linked to the highest excitability with few trials. We used Bayesian optimization as an automated, online search tool in an EEG-TMS simulation experiment. From a sample of 38 participants, we selected all participants with a significant single-subject phase effect (N = 5) for simulation. We then simulated 1000 experimental sessions per participant where we used Bayesian optimization to find the optimal phase. We tested two objective functions: Fitting a sinusoid in Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We additionally tested adaptive sampling using a knowledge gradient as the acquisition function compared with random sampling. We evaluated the algorithm's performance in a fast optimization (100 trials) and a long-term optimization (1000 trials). For fast optimization, the Bayesian linear regression in combination with adaptive sampling gives the best results with a mean phase location accuracy of 79 % after 100 trials. With either sampling approach, Bayesian linear regression performs better than GP regression in the fast optimization. In the long-term optimization, Bayesian regression with random sampling shows the best trajectory, with a rather steep improvement and good final performance of 87 % mean phase location accuracy. We show the suitability of closed-loop Bayesian optimization for phase selection. We could increase the speed and accuracy by using prior knowledge about the expected function shape compared with traditional Bayesian optimization with GP regression.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Efficient LDPC Codes For IRIG-106 Waveforms via Random Puncturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes form part of the IRIG-106 standard and have been successfully deployed for the Telemetry Group version of shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK-TG) modulation. Recently, LDPC code solutions have been proposed and optimized for continuous phase modulations (CPMs), including the pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and the multi-h CPM developed by the Advanced Range TeleMetry program (ARTM CPM). These codes were shown to perform around one dB from the respective channel capacities of these modulations. In this paper, we consider the effect of random puncturing of these LDPC codes to further improve spectrum efficiency. We present numerical simulation results that affirm the robust decoding performance promised by LDPC codes designed for ARTM CPM.</description>

      <title>Active and Passive Beamforming Designs for SER Minimization in RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research exploits the applications of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, specifically addressing the enhancement of communication reliability with modulated signals. Specifically, we first derive the analytical downlink symbol error rate (SER) of each user as a multivariate function of both the phase-shift and beamforming vectors. The analytical SER enables us to obtain insights into the synergistic dynamics between the RIS and MIMO communication. We then introduce a novel average SER minimization problem subject to the practical constraints of the transmitted power budget and phase shift coefficients, which is NP-hard. By incorporating the differential evolution (DE) algorithm as a pivotal tool for optimizing the intricate active and passive beamforming variables in RIS-assisted communication systems, the non-convexity of the considered SER optimization problem can be effectively handled. Furthermore, an efficient local search is incorporated into the DE algorithm to overcome the local optimum, and hence offer low SER and high communication reliability. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and the proposed optimization framework, indicating that the joint active and passive beamforming design is superior to the other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Content-based Wake-up for Energy-efficient and Timely Top-k IoT Sensing Data Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Energy efficiency and information freshness are key requirements for sensor nodes serving Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, where a sink node collects informative and fresh data before a deadline, e.g., to control an external actuator. Content-based wake-up (CoWu) activates a subset of nodes that hold data relevant for the sink's goal, thereby offering an energy-efficient way to attain objectives related to information freshness. This paper focuses on a scenario where the sink collects fresh information on top-k values, defined as data from the nodes observing the k highest readings at the deadline. We introduce a new metric called top-k Query Age of Information (k-QAoI), which allows us to characterize the performance of CoWu by considering the characteristics of the physical process. Further, we show how to select the CoWu parameters, such as its timing and threshold, to attain both information freshness and energy efficiency. The numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the CoWu approach, which is able to collect top-k data with higher energy efficiency while reducing k-QAoI when compared to round-robin scheduling, especially when the number of nodes is large and the required size of k is small.</description>

      <title>A physics-based perspective for understanding and utilizing spatial resources of wireless channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To satisfy the increasing demands for transmission rates of wireless communications, it is necessary to use spatial resources of electromagnetic (EM) waves. In this context, EM information theory (EIT) has become a hot topic by integrating the theoretical framework of deterministic mathematics and stochastic statistics to explore the transmission mechanisms of continuous EM waves. However, the previous studies were primarily focused on frame analysis, with limited exploration of practical applications and a comprehensive understanding of its essential physical characteristics. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3-D) line-of-sight channel capacity formula that captures the vector EM physics and accommodates both near- and far-field scenes. Based on the rigorous mathematical equation and the physical mechanism of fast multipole expansion, a channel model is established, and the finite angular spectral bandwidth feature of scattered waves is revealed. To adapt to the feature of the channel, an optimization problem is formulated for determining the mode currents on the transmitter, aiming to obtain the optimal design of the precoder and combiner. We make comprehensive analyses to investigate the relationship among the spatial degree of freedom, noise, and transmitted power, thereby establishing a rigorous upper bound of channel capacity. A series of simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model and numerical method. This work offers a novel perspective and methodology for understanding and leveraging EIT, and provides a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of future wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation and Tuning-Free Rank Detection for Probability Mass Function Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure which is computationally expensive for large datasets. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the joint PMF and automatically inferring its rank from observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing for tuning-free rank inference via a single training run. We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Additionally, we develop a scalable version of the VI-based approach by leveraging stochastic variational inference (SVI) to arrive at an efficient algorithm whose complexity scales sublinearly with the size of the dataset. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real movie recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI and SVI-based methods in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Filtered Randomized Smoothing: A New Defense for Robust Modulation Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classifiers have recently been used for the modulation classification of RF signals. These classifiers have shown impressive performance gains relative to conventional methods, however, they are vulnerable to imperceptible (low-power) adversarial attacks. Some of the prominent defense approaches include adversarial training (AT) and randomized smoothing (RS). While AT increases robustness in general, it fails to provide resilience against previously unseen adaptive attacks. Other approaches, such as Randomized Smoothing (RS), which injects noise into the input, address this shortcoming by providing provable certified guarantees against arbitrary attacks, however, they tend to sacrifice accuracy.
  In this paper, we study the problem of designing robust DNN-based modulation classifiers that can provide provable defense against arbitrary attacks without significantly sacrificing accuracy. To this end, we first analyze the spectral content of commonly studied attacks on modulation classifiers for the benchmark RadioML dataset. We observe that spectral signatures of un-perturbed RF signals are highly localized, whereas attack signals tend to be spread out in frequency. To exploit this spectral heterogeneity, we propose Filtered Randomized Smoothing (FRS), a novel defense which combines spectral filtering together with randomized smoothing. FRS can be viewed as a strengthening of RS by leveraging the specificity (spectral Heterogeneity) inherent to the modulation classification problem. In addition to providing an approach to compute the certified accuracy of FRS, we also provide a comprehensive set of simulations on the RadioML dataset to show the effectiveness of FRS and show that it significantly outperforms existing defenses including AT and RS in terms of accuracy on both attacked and benign signals.</description>

      <title>Network-level ISAC: Performance Analysis and Optimal Antenna-to-BS Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cooperative architecture is proposed for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, incorporating coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission along with multi-static sensing. We investigate how the allocation of antennas-to-base stations (BSs) affects cooperative sensing and cooperative communication performance. More explicitly, we balance the benefits of geographically concentrated antennas, which enhance beamforming and coherent processing, against those of geographically distributed antennas, which improve diversity and reduce service distances. Regarding sensing performance, we investigate three localization methods: angle-of-arrival (AOA)-based, time-of-flight (TOF)-based, and a hybrid approach combining both AOA and TOF measurements, for critically appraising their effects on ISAC network performance. Our analysis shows that in networks having N ISAC nodes following a Poisson point process, the localization accuracy of TOF-based methods follow a \ln^2 N scaling law (explicitly, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) reduces with \ln^2 N). The AOA-based methods follow a \ln N scaling law, while the hybrid methods scale as a\ln^2 N + b\ln N, where a and b represent parameters related to TOF and AOA measurements, respectively. The difference between these scaling laws arises from the distinct ways in which measurement results are converted into the target location. In terms of communication performance, we derive a tractable expression for the communication data rate, considering various cooperative region sizes and antenna-to-BS allocation strategy. It is proved that higher path loss exponents favor distributed antenna allocation to reduce access distances, while lower exponents favor centralized antenna allocation to maximize beamforming gain.</description>

      <title>Transformer-assisted Parametric CSI Feedback for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: As a key technology to meet the ever-increasing data rate demand in beyond 5G and 6G communications, millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have gained much attention recently.To make the most of mmWave massive MIMO systems, acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) is crucial. However, this task is by no means easy due to the CSI feedback overhead induced by the large number of antennas. In this paper, we propose a parametric CSI feedback technique for mmWave massive MIMO systems. Key idea of the proposed technique is to compress the mmWave MIMO channel matrix into a few geometric channel parameters (e.g., angles, delays, and path gains). Due to the limited scattering of mmWave signal, the number of channel parameters is much smaller than the number of antennas, thereby reducing the CSI feedback overhead significantly. Moreover, by exploiting the deep learning (DL) technique for the channel parameter extraction and the MIMO channel reconstruction, we can effectively suppress the channel quantization error. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional CSI feedback techniques in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Target Positioning for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology to empower next-generation mobile communication networks. In this paper, to address the computational complexity associated with conventional fingerprint positioning, we consider a novel cooperative positioning architecture that involves certain relevant access points (APs) to establish positioning similarity coefficients. Then, we propose an innovative joint positioning and correction framework employing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional sophisticated signal processing, which mainly leverages on the received signal strength information for preliminary positioning, supplemented by the angle of arrival information to refine the initial position estimation. Moreover, to mitigate the bias effects originating from remote APs, we design a cooperative weighted K-nearest neighbor (Co-WKNN)-based estimation scheme to select APs with a high correlation to participate in user positioning. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of various user positioning schemes, which reveal that the proposed MARL-based positioning scheme with Co-WKNN can effectively improve positioning performance. It is important to note that the cooperative positioning architecture is a critical element in striking a balance between positioning performance and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>In-Band Full-Duplex MIMO Systems for Simultaneous Communications and Sensing: Challenges, Methods, and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-band Full-Duplex (FD) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems offer a significant opportunity for Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) due to their capability to realize simultaneous signal transmissions and receptions. This feature has been recently exploited to devise spectrum-efficient simultaneous information transmission and monostatic sensing operations, a line of research typically referred to as MIMO FD-ISAC. In this article, capitalizing on a recent FD MIMO architecture with reduced complexity analog cancellation, we present an FD-enabled framework for simultaneous communications and sensing using data signals. In contrast to communications applications, the framework's goal is not to mitigate self interference, since it includes reflections of the downlink data transmissions from targets in the FD node's vicinity, but to optimize the system parameters for the intended dual functionality. The unique characteristics and challenges of a generic MIMO FD-ISAC system are discussed along with a broad overview of state-of-the-art special cases, including numerical investigations. Several directions for future work on FD-enabled ISAC relevant to signal processing communities are also provided.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the symbol error rate performance analysis is provided for a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and tracking (PASCAT) system. In specific, we employ multiple drones to actively transmit signals to a BS, which is responsible for continuously monitoring the location of drones over time and decoding the symbols transmitted from the drones. It is found that the estimated location parameters at a given moment during tracking follow Gaussian distributions with means equal to actual values and variances equal to root mean square error (RMSE). Afterwards, the obtained location information is employed for informing the channel information, which is then used to preprocess the received signal before decoding by using the maximum ratio combining (MRC) technique. The average symbol error rate (SER) is also evaluated over the distribution of the estimated location parameters and an approximate value for the average SER is obtained by using a Taylor approximation with fast convergence. The result indicates that there is a cooperation relationship between the RMSE of the estimated location parameters and the average SER. In addition, the effect of the number of pilot signals is analysed as well. By employing more pilots, it is found that both communication and sensing functionalities are enhanced. Furthermore, the SER performance of our PASCAT system is similar to that of maximum likelihood detection (MLD) when a number of pilot signals are employed, which demonstrates the efficiency of the PASCAT system. In the end, all results are validated by using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative UAV-Relay based Satellite Aerial Ground Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-fifth generation (5G) era, escalating user quality of service (QoS) strains terrestrial network capacity, especially in urban areas with dynamic traffic distributions. This paper introduces a novel cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle relay-based deployment (CUD) framework in satellite air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN). The CUD strategy deploys an unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay (UAVr) in an amplify-andforward (AF) mode to enhance user QoS when terrestrial base stations fall short of network capacity. By combining low earth orbit (LEO) satellite and UAVr signals using cooperative diversity, the CUD framework enhances the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the user. Comparative evaluations against existing frameworks reveal performance improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CUD framework in addressing the evolving demands of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of D-MIMO Networks under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary wireless communications systems adopt the Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique: a single base station or Access Point (AP) equipped with multiple antenna elements serves multiple active users simultaneously. Aiming at providing a more uniform wireless coverage, industry and academia have been working towards the evolution from centralized MIMO to Distributed-MIMO. That is, instead of having all the antenna elements co-located at a single AP, multiple APs, each equipped with a few or a single antenna element, jointly cooperate to serve the active users in the coverage area. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different D-MIMO setups under Rician fading, and considering different receive combining schemes. Note that the Rician fading model is convenient for MU-MIMO performance assessment, as it encompasses a wide variety of scenarios. Our numerical results show that the correlation among the channel vectors of different users increases with the Rician factor, which leads to a reduction on the achievable Spectral Efficiency (SE). Moreover, given a total number of antenna elements, there is an optimal number of APs and antenna elements per AP that provides the best performance. This "sweet spot" depends on the Rician factor and on the adopted receive combining scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy-Harvesting Hybrid VLC/RF Networks with Random Receiver Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an indoor hybrid visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) scenario with two-hop downlink transmission. A light emitting diode (LED) transmits both data and energy via VLC to an energy-harvesting relay node, which then uses the harvested energy to retransmit the decoded information to an RF user in the second phase. The design parameters include the direct current (DC) bias and the time allocation for VLC transmission. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the data rate under decode-and-forward relaying with fixed receiver orientation. The non-convex problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, solved iteratively by fixing one parameter while optimizing the other. Additionally, we analyze the impact of random receiver orientation on the data rate, deriving closed-form expressions for both VLC and RF rates. An exhaustive search approach is employed to solve the optimization, demonstrating that joint optimization of DC bias and time allocation significantly enhances the data rate compared to optimizing DC bias alone.</description>

      <title>How to Differentiate between Near Field and Far Field: Revisiting the Rayleigh Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless systems are likely to adopt extremely large aperture arrays to achieve higher throughput, wider coverage, and higher spatial resolution. Conventional wireless systems predominantly operate in the far field (FF) of the radiation source. However, as the array size increases and the carrier wavelength decreases, the near field (NF) becomes nonnegligible. Since the NF and FF differ in many aspects, it is critical to identify their corresponding regions. In this article, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the existing NF-FF boundaries, then introduce a novel NF-FF demarcation method based on effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of the channel. Since EDoF is intimately related to channel capacity, the EDoF-based border is able to characterize key channel performance more accurately than the classic Rayleigh distance and other representative benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the main features of the EDoF-based NF-FF boundary, provide insights into system design, and outline the associated challenges and research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Joint User Detection and Localization in Near-Field Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the problem of jointly detecting active user equipments (UEs) and estimating their location in the near field, wherein the base station (BS) is unaware of the number of active (or inactive) UEs and their positions. The system is equipped with multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that aid the process of inspecting the coverage area of the BS with adequate localization resolution providing a low-complexity solution for detection and location estimation. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the additional degrees of freedom due to the additional inspection points provided by the RISs. Specifically, we propose an iterative detection procedure, where multiple inspections are jointly considered, allowing the BS to assign known pilots to previously detected UEs and thereby to provide a structured channel access. Also, the problem of multiple access interference is explored and identified as a limiting performance factor for the activity detection. The results show that, with a proper implementation of the RISs, our proposed scheme can detect/localize the UEs with high accuracy, augmenting benchmark UE detection schemes to a spatially aware detection.</description>

      <title>Rechargeable UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Persistent Data Collection of Large-Scale Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability, nonetheless, the limited onboard energy restricts UAVs' application on persistent data collection missions in large areas. In this paper, we propose a rechargeable UAV-assisted periodic data collection scheme, where a UAV is dispatched to periodically collect data from sensor nodes (SNs) in the mission area and charged by a wireless charging platform. Specifically, the periodic data collection completion time is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory to reach the optimal balance among the collection time, flight time, and recharging time. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly. To tackle this problem, we divide the main problem into two sub-problems and address them by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA), bisection search, and heuristic methods. Then, we propose a periodic trajectory optimization algorithm to iteratively solve the two sub-problems to minimize the completion time. Furthermore, to deal with the dynamics of SNs, we propose a low-complexity trajectory adjustment strategy, where the trajectory can be maintained or adjusted locally at the SNs change, which significantly mitigates the computation cost of re-optimization. The simulation results show the superiority and robustness of the proposed scheme and the completion time is on average 39% and 33% lower than the two benchmarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Property Sensing in ISAC with Multiple Base Stations: Algorithm, Pilot Design, and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has opened up numerous game-changing opportunities for future wireless systems. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot signals to sense the electromagnetic (EM) property of the target and thus identify the materials of the target. Specifically, we first establish an EM wave propagation model with Maxwell equations, where the EM property of the target is captured by a closed-form expression of the channel. We then build the mathematical model for the relative permittivity and conductivity distribution (RPCD) within a predetermined region of interest shared by multiple base stations (BSs). Based on the EM wave propagation model, we propose an EM property sensing method, in which the RPCD can be reconstructed from compressive sensing techniques that exploits the joint sparsity structure of the EM property vector. We then develop a fusion algorithm to combine data from multiple BSs, which can enhance the reconstruction accuracy of EM property by efficiently integrating diverse measurements. Moreover, the fusion is performed at the feature level of RPCD and features low transmission overhead. We further design the pilot signals that can minimize the mutual coherence of the equivalent channels and enhance the diversity of incident EM wave patterns. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving high-quality RPCD reconstruction and accurate material classification.</description>

      <title>KID-PPG: Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Extracting Heart Rate from a Smartwatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of heart rate from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals remains challenging due to motion artifacts and signal degradation. Although deep learning methods trained as a data-driven inference problem offer promising solutions, they often underutilize existing knowledge from the medical and signal processing community. In this paper, we address three shortcomings of deep learning models: motion artifact removal, degradation assessment, and physiologically plausible analysis of the PPG signal. We propose KID-PPG, a knowledge-informed deep learning model that integrates expert knowledge through adaptive linear filtering, deep probabilistic inference, and data augmentation. We evaluate KID-PPG on the PPGDalia dataset, achieving an average mean absolute error of 2.85 beats per minute, surpassing existing reproducible methods. Our results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in heart rate tracking through the incorporation of prior knowledge into deep learning models. This approach shows promise in enhancing various biomedical applications by incorporating existing expert knowledge in deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of cellular networks for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is an appealing solution due to the wide availability of cellular infrastructure. Estimating the number of devices (network load) is vital for efficient allocation of the available resources, especially for managing the random access channel (RACH) of the network. This paper considers a two-priority RACH and proposes two network load estimators: a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and a reduced complexity (RCML) variant. The estimators are based on a novel model of the random access behavior of the devices coupled with a flexible analytical framework to calculate the involved probabilities. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed estimators for different network configurations.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Radio Channel Representation for 5G and 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A site-specific radio channel representation (SSCR) takes the surroundings of the communication system into account by considering the environment geometry, including buildings, vegetation, and mobile objects with their material and surface properties. We present methods for an SSCR that is spatially consistent, such that mobile transmitter and receiver cause a correlated time-varying channel impulse response and closely spaced antennas are correctly correlated. An SSCR is composed of a dynamically varying number of multipath components solely defined by the environment geometry and the material of the environmental objects. Hence, the environment geometry is the only natural scenario parameterization and specific calibration procedures shall be avoided. 5G and 6G physical layer technologies are increasingly able to exploit the properties of a wide range of environments from dense urban areas to railways, road transportation, industrial automation, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The channel impulse response in this wide range of scenarios has generally non-stationary statistical properties, i.e., the Doppler spectrum, power delay profile, K-factor and spatial correlation are all spatially variant (or time-variant for mobile receivers). SSCRs will enable research and development of emerging 5G and 6G technologies such as distributed multiple-input multiple-output systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, multi-band communication, and joint communication and sensing. We highlight the state of the art and summarize research directions for future work towards an SSCR.</description>

      <title>Scatterer Recognition for Multi-Modal Intelligent Vehicular Channel Modeling via Synesthesia of Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-modal intelligent vehicular channel model is proposed by scatterer recognition from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). The proposed model can support the design of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To provide a robust data foundation, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset in vehicular urban scenarios is constructed. Based on the constructed dataset, the complex SoM mechanism, i.e., mapping relationship between scatterers in electromagnetic space and LiDAR point clouds in physical environment, is explored via multilayer perceptron (MLP) in consideration of electromagnetic propagation mechanism. By using LiDAR point clouds to implement scatterer recognition, channel non-stationarity and consistency are captured closely coupled with the environment. Using ray-tracing (RT)-based results as the ground truth, the scatterer recognition accuracy exceeds 90%. The accuracy of the proposed model is further verified by the close fit between simulation results and RT results.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Power Allocation for Generative Semantic Communications with Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made a significant breakthrough in generative modeling. The combination of the generative model and semantic communication (SemCom) enables high-fidelity semantic information exchange at ultra-low rates. A novel generative SemCom framework for image tasks is proposed, wherein pre-trained foundation models serve as semantic encoders and decoders for semantic feature extractions and image regenerations, respectively. The mathematical relationship between the transmission reliability and the perceptual quality of the regenerated image and the semantic values of semantic features are modeled, which are obtained by conducting numerical simulations on the Kodak dataset. We also investigate the semantic-aware power allocation problem, with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while guaranteeing semantic performance. To solve this problem, two semanticaware power allocation methods are proposed by constraint decoupling and bisection search, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed semantic-aware methods demonstrate superior performance compared to the conventional one in terms of total power consumption.</description>

      <title>Angular Spread Statistics for 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Mid-Band Frequencies in an Indoor Hotspot Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03013</link>

Abstract: We present detailed multipath propagation spatial statistics for next-generation wireless systems operating at lower and upper mid-band frequencies spanning 6--24 GHz. The large-scale spatial characteristics of the wireless channel include Azimuth angular Spread of Departure (ASD) and Zenith angular Spread of Departure (ZSD) of multipath components (MPC) from a transmitter and the Azimuth angular Spread of Arrival (ASA) and Zenith angular Spread of Arrival (ZSA) at a receiver. The angular statistics calculated from measurements were compared with industry-standard 3GPP models, and ASD and ASA values were found to be in close agreement at both 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz. Measured LOS ASD was found larger than 3GPP ASD indicating more diverse MPC departure directions in the azimuth. ZSA and ZSD were observed smaller than the 3GPP modeling results as most multipath arrivals and departures during measurements were recorded at the boresight antenna elevation. The wide angular spreads indicate a multipath-rich spatial propagation at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, showing greater promise for the implementation of MIMO beamforming systems in the mid-band spectrum.</description>

      <title>Point Data for Site-Specific Mid-band Radio Propagation Channel Statistics in the Indoor Hotspot (InH) Environment for 3GPP and Next Generation Alliance (NGA) Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive work has been carried out in the past year by various organizations in an effort to determine standardized statistical channel impulse response (CIR) parameters for the newly-released mid-band spectrum (7.25 GHz -- 24.25 GHz) [1]--[5]. In this work, we show that the wireless community currently lacks a unified method for presenting key parameters required for transparency and utilization by several constituencies when presenting propagation data for use by standard bodies or third parties to create statistical CIR models. This paper aims to solve the existing problem by offering a standard method for providing key propagation parameters such as bandwidth, antenna beamwidth, noise-threshold level, and coarseness in point form, for use in creating standards or comparing parameters, rather than providing commonly-used cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots, which hide the observed key statistics on a location-by-location, point-by-point basis. The method for presenting propagation data, proposed here, may be used for statistical channel modeling of pooled datasets from many contributors, additionally also holding promise for exploring ray-tracing (e.g. site-specific) channel modeling. The indoor hotspot (InH) data collected in Spring2024 at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHZ by NYU WIRELESS [1]--[3] is provided for the first time in point form, to augment statistical models previously presented solely as CDFs, to demonstrate how a standardized approach to measurement data could allow others to utilize the site-specific locations and key channel parameters observed at each location, to better understand, vet, and build upon statistical or site-specific CIRs from the contributions of many different data sources.</description>

      <title>TrustEMG-Net: Using Representation-Masking Transformer with U-Net for Surface Electromyography Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a widely employed bio-signal that captures human muscle activity via electrodes placed on the skin. Several studies have proposed methods to remove sEMG contaminants, as non-invasive measurements render sEMG susceptible to various contaminants. However, these approaches often rely on heuristic-based optimization and are sensitive to the contaminant type. A more potent, robust, and generalized sEMG denoising approach should be developed for various healthcare and human-computer interaction applications. This paper proposes a novel neural network (NN)-based sEMG denoising method called TrustEMG-Net. It leverages the potent nonlinear mapping capability and data-driven nature of NNs. TrustEMG-Net adopts a denoising autoencoder structure by combining U-Net with a Transformer encoder using a representation-masking approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using the Ninapro sEMG database with five common contamination types and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Compared with existing sEMG denoising methods, TrustEMG-Net achieves exceptional performance across the five evaluation metrics, exhibiting a minimum improvement of 20%. Its superiority is consistent under various conditions, including SNRs ranging from -14 to 2 dB and five contaminant types. An ablation study further proves that the design of TrustEMG-Net contributes to its optimality, providing high-quality sEMG and serving as an effective, robust, and generalized denoising solution for sEMG applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Code Multiple Access: Architecture and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a $K$-user lattice-code based multiple-access (LCMA) scheme. Each user equipment (UE) encode its message with a practical lattice code, where we suggest a $2^m$-ary \emph{ring code} with symbol-wise bijective mapping to $2^m$-PAM. The coded-modulated signal is spread with its designated signature sequence, and all $K$ UEs transmit simultaneously. The LCMA receiver choose some integer coefficients, computes the associated $K$ streams of \emph{integer linear combinations} (ILCs) of the UEs' messages, and then reconstruct all UEs' messages from these ILC streams. To execute this, we put forth new efficient LCMA \emph{soft detection} algorithms, which calculate the a posteriori probability of the ILC over the lattice. The complexity is of order no greater than $O(K)$, suitable for massive access of a large $K$. The soft detection outputs are forwarded to $K$ ring-code decoders, which employ $2^m$-ary belief propagation to recover the ILC streams.
  To identify the optimal integer coefficients of the ILCs, a new ``%\emph{bounded independent vectors problem}" (BIVP) is established. We then solve this BIVP by developing a new \emph{rate-constraint sphere decoding} algorithm, significantly outperforming existing LLL and HKZ lattice reduction methods. Then, we develop optimized signature sequences of LCMA using a new target-switching steepest descent algorithm. With our developed algorithms, LCMA is shown to support a significantly higher load of UEs and exhibits dramatically improved error rate performance over state-of-the-art multiple access schemes such as interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) and sparse-code multiple-access (SCMA). The advances are achieved with just parallel processing and $K$ single-user decoding operations, avoiding the implementation issues of successive interference cancelation and iterative detection.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design and Antenna Selection for Dynamic HRIS-aided MISO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) to enhance multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communications, leveraging the property of dynamically placing active elements. Specifically, considering the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs), we investigate channel-aware configurations of the receive antennas at the base station (BS) and the active/passive elements at the HRIS to improve transmission reliability. To this end, we address the average mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem for the HRIS-aided MISO system by jointly optimizing the BS receive antenna selection matrix, the reflection phase coefficients, the reflection amplitude matrix, and the mode selection matrix of the HRIS. To overcome the non-convexity and intractability of this problem, we first transform the binary and discrete variables into continuous ones, and then propose a penalty-based exact block coordinate descent (PEBCD) algorithm to alternately solve these subproblems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed scheme over conventional benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with functional constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first order (SFO) complexity, almost at par with that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail a obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Federated Edge Learning with Streaming Data: A Lyapunov Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has received significant attention in recent years for its advantages in efficient training of machine learning models across distributed clients without disclosing user-sensitive data. Specifically, in federated edge learning (FEEL) systems, the time-varying nature of wireless channels introduces inevitable system dynamics in the communication process, thereby affecting training latency and energy consumption. In this work, we further consider a streaming data scenario where new training data samples are randomly generated over time at edge devices. Our goal is to develop a dynamic scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to address the inherent randomness in data arrivals and resource availability under long-term energy constraints. To achieve this, we formulate a stochastic network optimization problem and use the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to obtain a dynamic resource management design. Our proposed algorithm makes adaptive decisions on device scheduling, computational capacity adjustment, and allocation of bandwidth and transmit power in every round. We provide convergence analysis for the considered setting with heterogeneous data and time-varying objective functions, which supports the rationale behind our proposed scheduling design. The effectiveness of our scheme is verified through simulation results, demonstrating improved learning performance and energy efficiency as compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Recognizers for Activities of Daily Living</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart home environments enables several applications in the areas of energy management, safety, well-being, and healthcare. ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained. Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Photovoltaic Forecasting Model for Qualifying Uncertainty during Hazy Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources. Forecasting photovoltaic power generation is an important way to increase photovoltaic penetration. However, the difficulty in qualifying the uncertainty of PV power generation, especially during hazy weather, makes forecasting challenging. This paper proposes a novel model to address the issue. We introduce a modified entropy to qualify uncertainty during hazy weather while clustering and attention mechanisms are employed to reduce computational costs and enhance forecasting accuracy, respectively. Hyperparameters were adjusted using an optimization algorithm. Experiments on two datasets related to hazy weather demonstrate that our model significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to existing models.</description>
