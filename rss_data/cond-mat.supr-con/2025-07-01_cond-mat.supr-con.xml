      <title>Superconducting exchange coupling driven bistable and absolute switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As per de Gennes predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagneticinsulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect: a phenomenological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a novel quantum phenomenon with nonreciprocal supercurrent, the Josephson diode effect was intensively studied in recent years. Here, we construct a generalized resistively capacitance shunted junction (RCSJ) model as a low-energy effective/phenomenological theory for a general Josephson junction. For the ideal diode effect defined by unequal critical currents $|I_{c+}|\ne|I_{c-}|$, both inversion $\mathcal{I}$ and time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries are required to be broken. It can be further divided into two classes: intrinsic ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking for the junction itself) and extrinsic ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking under external current reversion). In addition, a pseudo diode effect ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking not necessary) can be defined by $|I_{c+}|=|I_{c-}|$ but unequal retrapping currents $|I_{r+}|\ne|I_{r-}|$, for which noise current is further shown to produce the diode feature effectively. Finally, when radio-frequency AC external current exists, the Shapiro steps appear and can be used to distinguish the above three types of the diode effect. Our work provides a unified framework for studying the Josephson diode effect and can be applied to design workable superconducting circuits incorporating the Josephson diode as a fundamental circuit element.</description>

      <title>Establishment of global phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB2 nanocomposite: Roles of interface, morphology and defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we have reported that a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB2 nanocomposite exhibits bulk-like superconducting properties with isotropic pinning, showing an excellent phase-coherent capability irrespective of the low volume fraction (~30 vol. %) of MgB2 [Uchino et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 035146 (2020); Teramachi et al,, Phys. Rev. B 108, 155146 (2023)]. Hence, this nanocomposite provides a useful experimental system to investigate the relationship between the structural disorder and the establishment of the superconducting phase coherence. In this work, we show from 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data that in the nanocomposite, a complex MgO/MgB2 microstructure spreads isotropically throughout the sample with a constant fractal dimension of ~1.67. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has revealed that the MgO/MgB2 interfaces are atomically clean and free from amorphous grain boundaries, even leading to atomically coherent interfaces. Detailed ac susceptibility measurements have demonstrated a smooth crossover from an intragranular to an intergranular superconducting regime, giving evidence of the establishment of the critical state due to strong intergranular coupling just below the superconducting transition temperature. Also, spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements have demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the MgO-rich phase tend to aggregate near the MgO/MgB2 boundary regions, forming long channels of oxygen vacancies through the nanocomposite. These channels of oxygen vacancies will contribute to the long-range carrier transfer and the related Andreev reflection via coherent tunneling of charge carriers among the oxygen vacancy sites.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Materials-Based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional monolayer MoS2-based Josephson junction which is composed by an intermediate semiconductor flake and the semi-infinite topological and non-topological superconductor leads and study its quantum transport properties by using the tight-binding non-equilibrium Green function method. By introducing a simple tight-binding model, it is shown that, when the absolute value of chemical potential is much smaller than the superconductor paring potential, the Majorana zero modes, whose Chern number is two, are formed in the topological leads. Also, we show that, in Josephson junction with ordinary superconductor leads, the Josephson current has sinusoidal behavior (due to forming the Andreev bound states (ABS)), when the absolute value of energy of carriers (and the chemical potential) is much smaller (greater) than the superconductor pairing potential. Of course, for Josephson junction with topological superconductor leads, it is shown that the ABS are not formed and in consequence the related Josephson current is zero. Therefore, one can consider the two-dimensional monolayer MoS2-based Josephson junction as a two-state switch which is in open-state (due to ABS) when the chemical potential is greater than 0.8 eV and is in close-state (due to Majorana) when the chemical potential is less than &lt; 0.8 or is equal to zero, i.e., ABS cannot mimic the Majorana state, as zero-bias conductance.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap and its Little-Parks like oscillations with high-order harmonics in lithium intercalated 1T-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.</description>

      <title>Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>High-mobility heavy quasiparticles in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice CeTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of hydrogen absorption and hypervalent metal hydride formation in lanthanum using cryogenic ball milling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare earth superhydrides exhibit high temperature superconductivity but are difficult to characterize and use in applications due to their high formation and stability pressures, which are typically in excess of 100 GPa. We studied how modification of the rare earth precursor improves hydrogen reactivity and hydrogen uptake for forming such metal hydrides at lower pressures. An elemental lanthanum precursor was milled at liquid nitrogen temperatures for different time intervals. After exposure to gaseous hydrogen at 380 C and 100 bar, we found a systematic enhancement of hydrogen absorption with increasing ball milling time for forming the LaHx, x=2-3 phase. Exposing the precursor to pressures up to 60 GPa with an ammonia borane (BNH6) hydrogen source resulted in a hypervalent LaH4 phase. This LaH4 phase is associated with the suppression of a rhombohedral distortion of the Fm3-m cubic structure after cryomilling the precursor.</description>

      <title>On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of S\'eamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. R\"ohler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. In addition to exploring understudied lattices, our contribution comprehensively analyzes the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities that are complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>
