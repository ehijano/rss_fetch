      <title>Contest design with a finite type-space: A unifying approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical contest design problem of allocating a budget across different prizes to maximize effort in a finite type-space environment. For any contest, we characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium. In this equilibrium, different agent types mix over contiguous intervals so that more efficient agents always exert greater effort than less efficient agents. We then solve for the expected equilibrium effort, and identify conditions under which the effect of increasing competition under linear costs is informative about the effect of such a transformation under general costs. As a result, we find that the winner-takes-all contest is optimal under linear and concave costs. Lastly, we obtain an equilibrium convergence result for the continuum type-space, and since the finite type-space encompasses the complete information environment as a special case, our analysis offers a unified approach to studying contests in these classical environments.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>Computing Most Equitable Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to design fair and (computationally) efficient voting rules is a central challenge in Computational Social Choice. In this paper, we aim at designing efficient algorithms for computing most equitable rules for large classes of preferences and decisions, which optimally satisfy two fundamental fairness/equity axioms: anonymity (every voter being treated equally) and neutrality (every alternative being treated equally). By revealing a natural connection to the graph isomorphism problem and leveraging recent breakthroughs by Babai [2019], we design quasipolynomial-time algorithms that compute most equitable rules with verifications, which also compute verifications about whether anonymity and neutrality are satisfied at the input profile. Further extending this approach, we propose the canonical-labeling tie-breaking, which runs in quasipolynomial-time and optimally breaks ties to preserve anonymity and neutrality. As for the complexity lower bound, we prove that even computing verifications for most equitable rules is GI-complete (i.e., as hard as the graph isomorphism problem), and sometimes GA-complete (i.e., as hard as the graph automorphism problem), for many commonly studied combinations of preferences and decisions. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first problems in computational social choice that are known to be complete in the class GI or GA.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>
