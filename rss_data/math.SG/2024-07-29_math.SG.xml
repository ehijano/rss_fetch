      <title>Computational symplectic topology and symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a computational approach to proving the Birkhoff conjecture on the restricted three-body problem, which asserts the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. Birkhoff had conjectured this surface of section as a tool to prove existence of a direct periodic orbit. Using techniques from validated numerics we prove the existence of an approximately circular direct orbit for a wide range of mass parameters and Jacobi energies. We also provide methods to rigorously compute the Conley-Zehnder index of periodic Hamiltonian orbits using computational tools, thus giving some initial steps for developing computational Floer homology and providing the means to prove the Birkhoff conjecture via symplectic topology. We apply this method to various symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem.</description>

      <title>Symplectic structures on the space of space curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present symplectic structures on the shape space of unparameterized space curves that generalize the classical Marsden-Weinstein structure. Our method integrates the Liouville 1-form of the Marsden-Weinstein structure with Riemannian structures that have been introduced in mathematical shape analysis. We also derive Hamiltonian vector fields for several classical Hamiltonian functions with respect to these new symplectic structures.</description>

      <title>The Traveling Mailman: Topological Optimization Methods for User-Centric Redistricting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new districting approach using the US Postal Service network to measure community connectivity. We combine Topological Data Analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to assess district boundaries' impact on community integrity. Using Iowa as a case study, we generate and refine districting plans using KMeans clustering and stochastic rebalancing. Our method produces plans with fewer cut edges and more compact shapes than the official Iowa plan under relaxed conditions. The low likelihood of finding plans as disruptive as the official one suggests potential inefficiencies in existing boundaries. Gaussian Mixture Model analysis reveals three distinct distributions in the districting landscape. This framework offers a more accurate reflection of community interactions for fairer political representation.</description>

      <title>If a Minkowski billiard is projective, it is the standard billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent paper arXiv:2405.13258, the first author of this note proved that if a billiard in a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is simultaneously projective and Minkowski, then it is the standard Euclidean billiard in an appropriate Euclidean structure. The proof was quite complicated and required high smoothness. Here we present a direct simple proof of this result which works in $C^1$-smoothness. In addition we prove the semi-local and local versions of the result</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo bound for curves in projective 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Castelnuovo bound conjecture, which is proposed by physicists, predicts an effective vanishing result for Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one. Previously, it is only known for a few cases and all the proofs rely on the Bogomolov-Gieseker conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda.
  In this paper, we prove the Castelnuovo bound conjecture for any Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one, up to a linear term and finitely many degree, without assuming the conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda. Furthermore, we prove an effective vanishing theorem for surface-counting invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds of Picard number one. We also apply our techniques to study low-degree curves on some explicit Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
  Our approach is based on a general iterative method to obtain upper bounds for the genus of one-dimensional closed subschemes in a fixed 3-fold, which is a combination of classical techniques and the wall-crossing of weak stability conditions on derived categories, and works for any projective 3-fold with at worst isolated singularities over any algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>On the intersection form of fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove, by an ad hoc method, that exact fillings with vanishing rational first Chern class of flexibly fillable contact manifolds have unique integral intersection forms. We appeal to the special Reeb dynamics (stronger than ADC \`a la Lazarev) on the contact boundary, while a more systematic approach working for general ADC manifolds is developed independently by Eliashberg, Ganatra and Lazarev. We also discuss cases where the vanishing rational first Chern class assumption can be removed. We derive the uniqueness of diffeomorphism types of exact fillings of certain flexibly fillable contact manifolds and obstructions to contact embeddings, which are not necessarily exact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We state a conjecture about the volume of symplectically self-polar convex bodies and show that it is equivalent to Mahler's conjecture concerning the volume of a convex body and its Euclidean polar. We also establish lower and upper bounds for symplectic capacities of symplectically self-polar bodies.</description>

      <title>Skewed Anosov flows are orbit equivalent to Reeb-Anosov flows in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in dimension 3, Anosov flows which are $\mathbb{R}$-covered and skewed are orbit equivalent to Reeb-Anosov flows. We characterize the existence of an invariant contact form or of a Birkhoff section with a given boundary, in terms of linking numbers between two invariant signed measures. Furthermore, we prove the existence of open book decompositions with one boundary component for Reeb-Anosov flows.</description>
