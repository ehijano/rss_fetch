      <title>On the Estrada Index and Spectral Properties of $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various properties of a hypergraph can be explored through its spectrum. In this paper,we estimate the bound for the sum of $t,\,t\in[1,n]$, largest eigenvalues of a $k$-uniform hypergraph of order $n$. Also, we characterize the $k$-uniform hypergraph with two distinct eigenvalues. We establish bounds for the Estrada index of $k$-uniform hypergraphs based on their number of edges, order and energy. In addition, we obtain the second largest Estrada index among the unicyclic hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the fact that the complement of the complexification of a real hyperplane arrangement is homotopy equivalent to the Salvetti complex of the associated oriented matroid. Our proof involves no choices, is relatively easy to visualize, and generalizes to the setting of conditional oriented matroids.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs without complete partite subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix integers $r \ge 2$ and $2\le s_1\le \cdots \le s_{r-1}\le s_r$ and set $S=\prod_{i=1}^{r-1}s_i$. Let $K=K(s_1, \ldots, s_{r-1}, s_r)$ denote the complete $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with parts of size $s_1, \ldots, s_{r-1}, s_r$. We prove that the maximum number of edges in an $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with parts $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ each of size $n$ with no copy of $K$ where the part of size $s_i$ is in $X_i$ for all $i$ is $n^{r-1/S-o(1)}$ provided $s_r&gt; 3^{S+o(S)}$. In other words, the Zarankiewicz number $z(n, K)= n^{r-1/S-o(1)}$. Previously this was known only for $s_r &gt; ((r-1)(S-1))!$ due to Pohoata and Zakharov. Our approach, which uses Behrend's construction of sets with no 3 term arithmetic progression, also applies for small values of $s_i$, for example, it gives $z(n, K(2,2,7))=n^{11/4-o(1)}$ where the exponent 11/4 is optimal.</description>

      <title>Binomiality of colored Gaussian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following earlier work by Coons-Maraj-Misra-Sorea and Misra-Sullivant, we study colored, undirected Gaussian graphical models, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for such a model to have binomial vanishing ideal. These conditions involve Jordan schemes, a variant of association schemes, well-known structures in algebraic combinatorics. Using association schemes without transitive group action, we refute the conjecture by Coons-Maraj-Misra-Sorea that binomiality implies that the color classes must be orbits under the automorphism group of the colored graph.</description>

      <title>Majority bootstrap percolation on the permutahedron and other high-dimensional graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majority bootstrap percolation is a model of infection spreading in networks. Starting with a set of initially infected vertices, new vertices become infected once half of their neighbours are infected. Balogh, Bollob\'{a}s and Morris studied this process on the hypercube and showed that there is a phase transition as the density of the initially infected set increases. Generalising their results to a broad class of high-dimensional graphs, the authors of this work established similar bounds on the critical window, establishing a universal behaviour for these graphs. These methods necessitated an exponential bound on the order of the graphs in terms of their degrees. In this paper, we consider a slightly more restrictive class of high-dimensional graphs, which nevertheless covers most examples considered previously. Under these stronger assumptions, we are able to show that this universal behaviour holds in graphs of superexponential order. As a concrete and motivating example, we apply this result to the permutahedron, a symmetric high-dimensional graph of superexponential order which arises naturally in many areas of mathematics. Our methods also allow us to slightly improve the bounds on the critical window given in previous work, in particular in the case of the hypercube. Finally, the upper and lower bounds on the critical window depend on the maximum and minimum degree of the graph, respectively, leading to much worse bounds for irregular graphs. We also analyse an explicit example of a high-dimensional irregular graph, namely the Cartesian product of stars and determine the first two terms in the expansion of the critical probability, which in this case is determined by the minimum degree.</description>

      <title>On Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number and recognition of Sierpi\'{n}ski products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sierpi\'{n}ski product $G \otimes _f H$ of graphs $G$ and $H$ with respect to a function $f \colon V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ has the vertex set $V(G)\times V(H)$. For every $g\in V(G)$ it contains a disjoint copy $gH$ of $H$, and for every edge $gg'$ of $G$ there is the edge $(g,f(g'))(g',f(g))$ between $gH$ and $g'H$. In this paper, the Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number is defined as the minimum of $\chi_{\rho}(G\otimes _f H)$ over all functions $f$, where $\chi_{\rho}(X)$ is the packing chromatic number of $X$. The upper Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number is analogously defined as the maximum corresponding value. The (upper) Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number is determined for all Sierpi\'{n}ski product graphs whose both factors are complete. Sierpi\'{n}ski product graphs whose factors are paths or stars are also studied. Their Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number is always $3$, while their upper Sierpi\'{n}ski packing chromatic number is bounded from below and above. It is also proved that for a given graph $G$, it can be checked in polynomial time whether $G$ has a representation as a Sierpi\'{n}ski product graphs both factors of which being trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each positive integer $n$, we define the divisibility relation graph $D_n$ whose vertex set is the set of divisors of $n$, and in which two vertices are adjacent if one is a divisor of the other. This type of graph is a special case of graphs associated with a partial order, which have been widely studied in the literature. In this work, we determine various graph-theoretic invariants of divisibility relation graphs, such as their clique and independence numbers, and their planarity. We also discuss various spectral properties that are discovered by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On orbit sets generated by semigroups of one-dimensional affine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ is formed by the images of a number $s$ under the action of a semigroup generated by the integer affine functions $f_i=a_i x+b_i$ taken from the set $F=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$. P.Erd\"os established an upper bound $O(x^{\sigma+\epsilon})$ for the growth function $|\langle F : s \rangle\cap[0,x]|$, where $1/a_1^{\sigma}+1/a_2^{\sigma}+\ldots + 1/a_n^{\sigma}=1$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which was extended to orbit multisets and real affine functions by J.Lagarias. We complement this by a lower bound $\Omega(x^{\sigma})$ for the multiset size $|\langle F : s \rangle^\#\cap[0,x]|$.
  P.Erd\"os and R.Graham asked whether an orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density when $F$ is a basis of a free semigroup and $1/a_1+1/a_2+\ldots + 1/a_n=1$. Under these two conditions we establish a sublinear lower bound $|\langle F : s \rangle \cap [0,x]|=\Omega(x/\log^{\frac{n-1}2} x)$. We also show that if $F$ gives a partition of integers, i.e. when $f_1(\mathbb Z) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup f_n(\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z$, this bound can be strengthened to $\Omega(x)$, so the set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebraic interpretation of generalized Markov numbers and their matrixizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize classic mass partition results dealing with partitions using spheres, parallel hyperplanes, or axis-parallel wedges to the setting of mass assignments. In a mass assignment problem, we assign mass distributions continuously to all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and seek to guarantee the existence of a particular subspace in which more masses can be bisected than those by analyzing the problem in $\mathbb{R}^k$. We prove new mass assignment results for spheres, parallel hyperplanes, and axis-parallel wedges. The proof techniques rely on new Borsuk--Ulam type theorems on spheres and Stiefel manifolds.</description>

      <title>Walk Matrix-Based Upper Bounds on Generalized Cospectral Mates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing graphs determined by their spectrum (DS) or generalized spectrum (DGS) has been a longstanding topic of interest in spectral graph theory, originating from questions in chemistry and mathematical physics. While previous studies primarily focus on identifying whether a graph is DGS, we address a related yet distinct question: how many non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates a graph can have? Building upon recent advances that connect this question to the properties of the walk matrix, we introduce a broad family of graphs and establish an explicit upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates they can have. This bound is determined by the arithmetic structure of the determinant of the walk matrix, offering a refined criterion for quantifying the multiplicity of generalized cospectral graphs. This result sheds new light on the structure of generalized cospectral graphs and provides a refined arithmetic criterion for bounding their multiplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify edge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by congruent pentagons with the edge combination $a^4b$ and with rational angles in degree: they are a one-parameter family of symmetric $a^4b$-pentagonal subdivisions of the tetrahedron with $12$ tiles; a sequence of unique symmetric $a^4b$-pentagons admitting a symmetric $3$-layer earth map tiling by $4m$ tiles for any $m\ge4$, among which each odd $m$ case admits two standard flip modifications; and a unique non-symmetric and degenerate $a^4b$-pentagon admitting a non-symmetric $3$-layer earth map tiling and its standard flip modification with $20$ tiles. The full classification from this series and all induced non-edge-to-edge quadrilateral tilings from degenerate pentagons are summarized with their 3D pictures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the tropical trigonal construction to calculate the second moment of the tropical Prym variety of all double covers $\pi:\widetilde{\Gamma}\to \Gamma$ of tropical curves of genus $g(\Gamma)\leq 4$. The answer is expressed in terms of the signed graphic matroid of the double cover and consists a polynomial and piecewise-polynomial term. We relate the latter term, which does not occur in the analogous formula for the tropical Jacobian, to the problem of extending the Prym--Torelli map from the moduli space of admissible double covers to the second Voronoi compactification of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the mixed Segre zeta function of a sequence of homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring. This function is a power series encoding information about the mixed Segre classes obtained by extending the ideals to projective spaces of arbitrarily large dimension. Our work generalizes and unifies results by Kleiman and Thorup on mixed Segre classes and by Aluffi on Segre zeta functions. We prove that this power series is rational, with poles corresponding to the degrees of the generators of the ideals. We also show that the mixed Segre zeta function only depends on the integral closure of the ideals. Finally, we prove that the homogenization of the numerator of a modification of the mixed Segre zeta function is denormalized Lorentzian in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $ G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,d, \alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $ G(n,\alpha/n)$. Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed walk graphs, leveraging block cut trees and ear decompositions, to control $\mathbb E \mathrm{tr}(A^k)$. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023).</description>

      <title>The cohomology ring of the boundary manifold of a combinatorial line arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohen--Suciu proved that the cohomology ring of the boundary manifold of a complex projective line arrangement is isomorphic to the double of the cohomology ring of the complement. In this paper, we generalize this result to arbitrary combinatorial line arrangements, including non-realizable ones. The notion of the boundary manifold for combinatorial line arrangements was introduced by Ruberman--Starkston. To handle arbitrary combinatorial line arrangements, we construct explicit homology cycles following the method by Doig--Horn. Using these cycles, we compute the cohomology ring of the boundary manifold and prove that it is isomorphic to the double of the Orlik-Solomon algebra. As an application, we derive several results on the resonance variety of the boundary manifold.</description>

      <title>Strength of the Upper Bounds for the Edge-Weighted Maximum Clique Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally compare the strength of the two main upper bounds from the literature on the optimal value of the Edge-Weighted Maximum Clique Problem (EWMCP). We provide a set of instances for which the ratio between either of the two upper bounds and the optimal value of the EWMCP is unbounded. This result shows that neither of the two upper bounds can give a performance guarantee. In addition, we provide two sets of instances for which the ratio between the two upper bounds, and its reciprocal, are unbounded. This result shows that there are EWMCP instances in which one of the upper bounds can be arbitrarily better than the other one and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive computational experiments on two benchmark datasets: the standard DIMACS instances and randomly generated instances, providing practical insights into the empirical strength of the upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Bisections of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a result on the bisection of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Our methods consist of the development of a novel lifting method to define the configuration space--test map scheme, which transforms the problem to a Borsuk--Ulam-type question on equivariant fiber bundles, along with a new computation of the parametrized Fadell--Husseini index. As the primary application, we show that any $d+k+m-1$ mass assignments to linear $d$-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^{d+m}$ can be bisected by $k $ parallel hyperplanes in at least one $d$-space, provided that the Stirling number of the second kind $S(d+k+m-1, k)$ is odd. This generalizes all known cases of a conjecture by Sober\'on and Takahashi, which asserts that any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be bisected by $k$ parallel hyperplanes.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of squarefree principal vector-spread Borel ideals. We compute the minimal primary decomposition of these ideals and thereby we prove that they are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay.

      <title>Power saving for the Brown-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(n, v, e)$ denote the maximum number of edges in a 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices which does not contain $v$ vertices spanning at least $e$ edges. A central problem in extremal combinatorics, famously posed by Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os in 1973, asks whether $f(n, e+3, e)=o(n^2)$ for every $e \ge 3$. A classical result of S\'ark\"ozy and Selkow states that $f(n, e+\lfloor \log_2 e\rfloor+2, e)=o(n^{2})$ for every $e \ge 3$. This bound was recently improved by Conlon, Gishboliner, Levanzov and Shapira.
  Motivated by applications to other problems, Gowers and Long made the striking conjecture that $f(n, e+4, e)=O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(e)&gt;0$. Conlon, Gishboliner, Levanzov and Shapira, and later, Shapira and Tyomkyn reiterated the following approximate version of this problem. What is the smallest $d(e)$ for which $f(n, e+d(e), e)=O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(e)&gt;0$? In this paper, we prove that for each $e\geq 3$ we have $f(n, e+\lfloor \log_2 e\rfloor +38, e)=O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This shows that one can already obtain power saving near the S\'ark\"ozy-Selkow bound at the cost of a small additive constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a triangle design as a partition of the set of lines of a projective space into triangles, where a triangle consists of three pairwise intersecting lines with no common point. A triangle design is balanced if all points are involved in the same number of triangles. We construct balanced triangle designs in PG$(n-1,2)$ for all admissible $n$ (congruent to $1$ modulo $6$) and an infinite class of balanced block-divisible triangle designs. We also prove that the existence of a triangle design in PG$(n-1,2)$ invariant under the action of the Singer cycle group is equivalent to the existence of a partition of $Z_{2^n-1}\backslash\{0\}$ into special $18$-subsets and find such partitions for $n=7$, $13$, $19$.
  Keywords: Subspace design, graph decomposition, triangle design, Heffter's difference problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Lower Bounds for the Feedback Arc Set Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a directed graph, the Minimum Feedback Arc Set (FAS) problem asks for a minimum (size) set of arcs in a directed graph, which, when removed, results in an acyclic graph. In a seminal paper, Berger and Shor [1], in 1990, developed initial upper bounds for the FAS problem in general directed graphs. Here we find asymptotic \textit{lower bounds} for the FAS problem in a class of random, oriented, directed graphs derived from the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model $G(n,M)$, with n vertices and M (undirected) edges, the latter randomly chosen. Each edge is then randomly given a direction to form our directed graph. We show that
  $$Pr\left(\textbf{Y}^* \le M \left( \frac{1}{2} -\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\Delta_{av}}}\right)\right)$$ approaches zero exponentially in $n$, with $\textbf{Y}^*$ the (random) size of the minimum feedback arc set and $\Delta_{av}=2M/n$ the average vertex degree. Lower bounds for random tournaments, a special case, were obtained by Spencer [12] and de la Vega [13] and these are discussed. In comparing the bound above to averaged experimental FAS data on related random graphs developed by K. Hanauer [7] we find that the approximation $\textbf{Y}^*_{av} \approx M\left( \frac{1}{2} -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\Delta_{av}}}\right)$ lies remarkably close graphically to the algorithmically computed average size $\textbf{Y}^*_{av}$ of minimum feedback arc sets.</description>

Abstract: Let the tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\ell^{3-}$ be the $3$-graph on $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in the cyclic order. We show that, for every $\ell\ge 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Tur\'an density of $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$ and also prove some finer structure results. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi--Sudakov--Pikhurko from 2011 and extends the results of Balogh--Luo [Combinatorica 44 (2024) 949--976] who established analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\ell$.
  Results similar to ours were independently obtained by Lidick\'y--Mattes--Pfender [arXiv:2409.14257].</description>

      <title>Gluing Posets and the Dichotomy of Poset Saturation Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, we say that a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but adding any other set to $\mathcal F$ creates an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The saturation number of $\mathcal P$ is the size of the smallest $\mathcal P$-saturated family with ground set $[n]$. The saturation number for posets is known to exhibit a dichotomy: it is either bounded or it has at least $\sqrt n$ rate of growth. Determining which posets have bounded saturation number is a major open problem.
  In this paper we consider a `gluing' operation, formed from two finite posets $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ by setting all elements of $\mathcal P$ to be below all elements of $\mathcal Q$. We show that (under some mild assumptions) this operation preserves bounded and unbounded saturation number. This is the first such `new from old' poset construction to be found. As an application, we show that for any poset $\mathcal P$ one may add at most 3 elements to $\mathcal P$ to obtain a poset whose saturation number growth is at most linear: this may be viewed as a step towards the other major open problem in the area, namely the conjecture that every finite poset has this growth at most linear.
  We also consider the poset equivalent of weak saturation for graphs: for each finite poset $\mathcal P$, we determine exactly the minimum size of a percolating family for $\mathcal P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X_1,d_1),\dots, (X_N,d_N)$ be metric spaces, where $d_i: X_i \times X_i \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a distance function for $i=1,\dots,N$. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set theoretic product $X_1\times \cdots \times X_N$. Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$, and let $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}$ be a collection of weights, where each $p_{ij}\in (0, 1]$ is associated with the edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$. We introduce the function $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}: \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ defined by \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right), \end{align*} for all $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$. In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$. Then we determine how this distance behaves under various graph operations, including disjoint unions and Cartesian products. We investigate two limiting cases: (a) when $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is defined over a finite field, leading to a broad generalization of graph-based distances commonly studied in error-correcting code theory; and (b) when the metric is extended to graphons, enabling the measurement of distances in a continuous graph limit setting.</description>

Abstract: A sequence of representations \(V_n\) of the symmetric group \(S_n\) is called representation (multiplicity) stable if, after some \(n\), the irreducible decomposition of \(V_n\) stabilizes. In particular, Church, Ellenburg and Farb (2015) showed that for fixed \(a\) and \(b\), the space of diagonal harmonics \(DH_n^{a,b}\) exhibits this behavior, with its dimension eventually stabilizing to a polynomial in \(n\). Building on this result, we use the Schedules Formula by Haglund and Loehr (2005) to obtain an explicit combinatorial polynomial for the dimension of the bigraded spaces \(DH_n^{a,b}\). This derivation not only yields the dimension formula but also produces a new sharp stability bound of \(a + b\), and determines the exact degree of the dimension polynomial, which is also \(a + b\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study off-diagonal Ramsey numbers $r(H, K_n^{(k)})$ of $k$-uniform hypergraphs, where $H$ is a fixed linear $k$-uniform hypergraph and $K_n^{(k)}$ is complete on $n$ vertices. Recently, Conlon et al.\ disproved the folklore conjecture that $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ always grows polynomially in $n$. In this paper we show that much larger growth rates are possible in higher uniformity. In uniformity $k\ge 4$, we prove that for any constant $C&gt;0$, there exists a linear $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ for which $$r(H,K_n^{(k)}) \geq \textup{twr}_{k-2}(2^{(\log n)^C}).$$</description>

Abstract: We consider toric maximum likelihood estimation over the field of Puiseux series and study critical points of the likelihood function using tropical methods. This problem translates to finding the intersection points of a tropical affine space with a classical linear subspace. We derive new structural results on tropical affine spaces and use these to give a complete and explicit description of the tropical critical points in certain cases. In these cases, we associate tropical critical points to the simplices in a regular triangulation of the polytope giving rise to the toric model.</description>
