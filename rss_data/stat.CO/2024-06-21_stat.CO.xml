      <title>Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and the recently introduced interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), we propose several variants within the novel proximal IPLA family, tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable statistical model. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by multiple algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed family of algorithms on a toy hierarchical example where our assumptions can be checked, as well as on the problems of sparse Bayesian logistic regression, sparse Bayesian neural network, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in latent variable models for non-differentiable models.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>von Mises Quasi-Processes for Bayesian Circular Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The resulting probability model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient multi-level Gaussian process regression for functional data observed under completely or partially regular sampling designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a frequently used statistical method for flexible yet fully probabilistic non-linear regression modeling. A common obstacle is its computational complexity which scales poorly with the number of observations. This is especially an issue when applying Gaussian process models to multiple functions simultaneously in various applications of functional data analysis.
  We consider a multi-level Gaussian process regression model where a common mean function and individual subject-specific deviations are modeled simultaneously as latent Gaussian processes. We derive exact analytic and computationally efficient expressions for the log-likelihood function and the posterior distributions in the case where the observations are sampled on either a completely or partially regular grid. This enables us to fit the model to large data sets that are currently computationally inaccessible using a standard implementation. We show through a simulation study that our analytic expressions are several orders of magnitude faster compared to a standard implementation, and we provide an implementation in the probabilistic programming language Stan.</description>

      <title>An agent-based model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic individual-based model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimation via Differentiable Metropolis-Hastings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metropolis-Hastings estimates intractable expectations - can differentiating the algorithm estimate their gradients? The challenge is that Metropolis-Hastings trajectories are not conventionally differentiable due to the discrete accept/reject steps. Using a technique based on recoupling chains, our method differentiates through the Metropolis-Hastings sampler itself, allowing us to estimate gradients with respect to a parameter of otherwise intractable expectations. Our main contribution is a proof of strong consistency and a central limit theorem for our estimator under assumptions that hold in common Bayesian inference problems. The proofs augment the sampler chain with latent information, and formulate the estimator as a stopping tail functional of this augmented chain. We demonstrate our method on examples of Bayesian sensitivity analysis and optimizing a random walk Metropolis proposal.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Results for Moreau-Yosida Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed class of MCMC methods which uses proximity maps instead of gradients to build proposal mechanisms which can be employed for both differentiable and non-differentiable targets. These methods have been shown to be stable for a wide class of targets, making them a valuable alternative to Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms (MALA); and have found wide application in imaging contexts. The wider stability properties are obtained by building the Moreau-Yosida envelope for the target of interest, which depends on a parameter $\lambda$. In this work, we investigate the optimal scaling problem for this class of algorithms, which encompasses MALA, and provide practical guidelines for the implementation of these methods.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time guarantees for sampling based posterior inference in high-dimensional generalised linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of [49], but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>
