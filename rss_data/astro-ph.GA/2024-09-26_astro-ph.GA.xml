      <title>ALMA observations of super-early galaxies: attenuation-free model predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance and blue color of super-early (redshift $z&gt;10$), luminous galaxies discovered by JWST can be explained if radiation-driven outflows have ejected their dust on kpc-scales. To test this hypothesis, we predict the ALMA detectability of such extended dust component. Given the observed properties of the galaxy, its observed continuum flux at 88 $\mu$m, $F_{88}$, depends on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, $\xi_d$, and extent of the dust distribution, $r_d$. Once applied to the most distant galaxy known, GS-z14-0 at $z=14.32$, the fiducial model ($\xi_d = 1/529$) predicts $F_{88}^{\rm fid} = 14.9\, \mu$Jy, and a dust extent $r_d=1.4$ kpc. If the galaxy is very dust-rich ($\xi_d =1/40$), $F_{88}^{\rm max} = 40.1\, \mu$Jy. These values are smaller ($F_{88}^{\rm fid} = 9.5\, \mu$Jy) if the dust is predominantly made of large grains as those formed in SN ejecta. Forthcoming ALMA observations might come very close to constraining the fiducial predictions of the outflow-based attenuation-free model. Other super-early galaxies are predicted to be fainter at 88 $\mu$m, mostly because of their lower SFR compared to GS-z14-0, with fiducial fluxes in the range $2-5.2\ \mu$Jy.</description>

      <title>Environment matters: stronger magnetic fields in satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe and an important component of the interstellar medium. It is crucial to accurately model and understand their properties in different environments and across all mass ranges to interpret observables related to magnetic fields correctly. However, the assessment of the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is often hampered by limited numerical resolution in cosmological simulations, in particular for satellite galaxies. To this end, we study the magnetic fields in high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of disk galaxies (with $M_{200}\approx10^{10}$ to $10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and their satellites within the Auriga galaxy formation model including cosmic rays. We find significantly higher magnetic field strengths in satellite galaxies compared to isolated dwarfs with a similar mass or star-formation rate, in particular after they had their first close encounter with their host galaxy. While this result is ubiquitous and independent of resolution in the satellites that are past their first infall, there seems to be a wide range of amplification mechanisms acting together. Our result highlights the importance of considering the environment of dwarf galaxies when interpreting their magnetic field properties as well as related observables such as their gamma-ray and radio emission, the latter being particularly relevant for future observations such as with the SKA observatory.</description>

      <title>Extended hot dust emission around the earliest massive quiescent galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major unsolved problem in galaxy evolution is the early appearance of massive quiescent galaxies that no longer actively form stars only $ \sim 1$ billion years after the Big Bang. Their high stellar masses and extremely compact structure indicate that they formed through rapid bursts of star formation between redshift $z \sim 6-11$. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution cannot explain their high number density, rapid growth and truncation of star formation at such early times, which likely requires extreme feedback to destroy the cold interstellar medium (the fuel for star formation). We report the discovery of a significant reservoir of hot dust in one of the most distant known examples at $z = 4.658$, GS-9209. The dust was identified using JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), whose unprecedented sensitivity and high spatial resolution, for the first time, firmly show that this dust is significantly more extended than the stars by $\gtrsim 3$ times. We find that the dust has preferentially been evacuated or diluted in the galaxy center. Our analysis finds that the extended hot dust emission is consistent with recent heating by a younger and more spatially extended generation of star formation. This reveals that the earliest quiescent galaxies did not form in a single rapid burst; instead, similar to galaxy growth at later times, the center formed first with star formation continuing in an extended envelope. The growth of this galaxy is truncating from the inside out, consistent with central gas depletion from early AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>{An H{\alpha} view of galaxy build-up in the first 2 Gyr: luminosity functions at z~4-6.5 from NIRCam/grism spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The H{\alpha} nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H{\alpha} emitters at 3.7&lt;z&lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin^2 of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H{\alpha} at 4.9&lt;z&lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin^2 in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H{\alpha} at 3.8&lt;z&lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at $z\sim5.2$ in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H{\alpha} uminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.</description>

      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE). IX: The Angular Momentum Evolution of Milky Way-like Galaxies and their Circumgalactic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the co-evolution of the angular momentum of Milky Way-like galaxies, their circumgalactic gas, and their dark matter halos using zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. We examine how the magnitude and orientation of the angular momentum varies over time within the halo and between the components of mass. From z~2 to today, and in general across the simulated halos, the specific angular momenta of the central galaxies and the cool gas in their circumgalactic media (T &lt; 10^5 K) increase together. Over that same period, the specific angular momenta of the hot (&gt;10^6 K) and dark components of the halo change minimally. By z~1, the central galaxies have generally lost association with the angular momentum of their full dark matter halo -- both in magnitude and orientation. We find a wide distribution of angular momentum orientations in the halo, varying by up to 180 degrees over small (~tens of kpc) scales and between the different components of mass. The net angular momenta of the galaxies, their circumgalactic gas, and their dark matter halos are generally misaligned with one another at all cosmic times. The present-day orientation of the central galaxies are established at late times (after z=1), after the rates of cosmic accretion and mergers decline and the disks are able to settle and stabilize their orientation.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Accretion Disks Within Dark Matter Halos: Saturation of the Magneto-rotational Instability and the Field Expulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater (DM) halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to $10^{-5}$ pc or 2 AU. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, formation of geometrically-thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find that (1) accretion disk is subject to the magneto-rotational instability which further amplifies the field to near-equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used; (2) Equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the mid-plane; (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scaleheight; (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified; (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with $\beta \geq 0.1$ and its magnetosphere with $\beta &lt;&lt; 1$, where $\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_{\rm B}$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density; (6) The disk is highly variable due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-Virial Gas? The Supply from hot inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to understand the presence of super-virial gas detected in the Milky Way, we present our findings from isolated galaxy simulations of Milky Way-like systems using GIZMO with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. It unveils the presence of a significant super-virial temperature ( $T&gt;6\times10^6$K) gas component within 20 kpc from the galactic center. This super-virial gas has a mass of $1-2\times10^7$ ${\rm M_\odot}$ and is found close to the disk, where typical gas densities are $0.004-0.01 \, \rm cm^{-3}$. We find that some of the virial gas ($T\sim10^6$K) forms a rotating hot inflow, where gravitational energy is converted to heat mainly via compressive heating. This process causes gas infalling close to the rotation axis to reach super-virial temperatures just before cooling and joining the disk. Stellar feedback heating accounts for less than 1% of the super-virial gas, indicating its minimal influence despite expectations. Even in scenarios with no stellar feedback effects considered, abundant super-virial gas persists, highlighting the dominance of alternative heating mechanisms. We also show that cosmic rays do not have a significant effect on heating the gas to a super-virial temperature. Our study illuminates the intricate dynamics of hot virial and super-virial gas surrounding Milky Way-like galaxies, emphasizing the prominent role of infall-driven and compressive heating processes in shaping thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>Universal bimodality in kinematic morphology and the divergent pathways to galaxy quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical structure formation of our Universe inherently involves violent and chaotic episodes of mass assembly such as galaxy mergers. The level of bulk rotation of the collisionless stellar systems of galaxies reflects to what extent the galaxies, on the other hand, have assembled their stars during tranquil and ordered formation history, which fosters the growth of cohesively rotating structures. Observationally, galaxy populations show a wide spectrum of morphology and shapes, with different levels of rotational support. Despite the obvious variety and complexity, in this work we find that at a given stellar mass of galaxies, the distribution of the intrinsic spin parameter $\lambda_{R_{\rm e},\mathrm{intr}}$, i.e. the normalized specific angular momentum of stars, appears to be universally bimodal among galaxies in all star formation states and also in different environments. This ubiquitous bimodality in kinematic morphology evolves systematically with star formation and is particularly apparent for transitional galaxies of intermediate star formation rates, indicating that star formation quenching is proceeding separately within two distinct kinematic populations dominated by cold discs and hot spheroids. We show that the two populations also have contrasting recent star formation histories and metal enrichment histories, which reveal their divergent pathways to formation and quenching.</description>

      <title>The kinematic bimodality: Efficient feedback and cold gas deficiency in slow-rotating galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bimodality in the stellar spin of low redshift (massive) galaxies, ubiquitously existing at all star formation levels and in diverse environment, suggests that galaxies grow and quench through two diverged evolutionary pathways. For spheroid-dominated galaxies of slow stellar rotation, the age composition and metallicity of their stellar populations evidence a fast quenching history with significant gas outflows. In this work, we measure the spin parameter $\lambda_{R_{\rm e}}$, i.e. the normalized specific angular momentum of stars, out of the MaNGA integral field spectroscopy for about 10000 galaxies. Among the two thirds with HI follow-up observations ($z\lesssim0.05$), we find that, compared to fast-rotating galaxies of the same stellar mass and star formation, the galaxy population of slower rotation are generally more HI gas-poor, robust against further environmental restriction and with non-detections taken into proper account using stacking technique. This cold gas deficit of slow-rotating galaxies is most apparent at high mass $\sim10^{11}\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ below the star formation main sequence, supporting the pivotal role of gas outflows in their quenching history. With hints from HI velocity distributions, we suspect that massive gas outflows among the slow-rotating population are facilitated by high ejective feedback efficiency, which is a result of extensive coupling between disturbed volume-filling cold gas and (commonly) biconical feedback from central black holes. By contrast, in fast-rotating disc galaxies the feedback energy mostly goes to the hot circumgalactic medium rather than directly impacts the dense and planar cold gas, thus making the feedback mainly preventive against further gas inflow.</description>

      <title>The Magellanic Clouds are very rare in the IllustrisTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) form the closest interacting galactic system to the Milky Way, therewith providing a laboratory to test cosmological models in the local Universe. We quantify the likelihood for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to be observed within the $\Lambda$CDM model using hydrodynamical simulations of the IllustrisTNG project. The orbits of the MCs are constrained by proper motion measurements taken by the $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ and $Gaia$. The MCs have a mutual separation of $d_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~24.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and a relative velocity of $v_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~90.8\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, implying a phase-space density of $f_{\mathrm{MCs,obs}}~\equiv~(d_{\mathrm{MCs}} \cdot v_{\mathrm{MCs}})^{-3}~=~9.10\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{km^{-3}\,s^{3}\,kpc^{-3}}$. We select analogues to the MCs based on their stellar masses and distances in MW-like halos. None of the selected LMC analogues have a higher total mass and lower Galactocentric distance than the LMC, resulting in $&gt;3.75\sigma$ tension. We also find that the $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ distribution in the highest resolution TNG50 simulation is in $3.95\sigma$ tension with observations. Thus, a hierarchical clustering of two massive satellites like the MCs in a narrow phase-space volume is unlikely in $\Lambda$CDM, presumably because of short merger timescales due to dynamical friction between the overlapping dark matter halos. We show that group infall led by an LMC analogue cannot populate the Galactic disc of satellites (DoS), implying that the DoS and the MCs formed in physically unrelated ways in $\Lambda$CDM. Since the $20^\circ$ alignment of the LMC and DoS orbital poles has a likelihood of $P=0.030$ ($2.17\sigma$), adding this $\chi^2$ to that of $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ gives a combined likelihood of $P = 3.90\times10^{-5}$ ($4.11\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Pulling back the curtain on shocks and star-formation in NGC 1266 with Gemini-NIFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph (NIFS) K-band observations of the central 400 pc of NGC 1266, a nearby (D$\approx$30 Mpc) post-starburst galaxy with a powerful multi-phase outflow and a shocked ISM. We detect 7 H$_2$ ro-vibrational emission lines excited thermally to $T$$\sim$2000 K, and weak Br$\gamma$ emission, consistent with a fast C-shock. With these bright H$_2$ lines, we observe the spatial structure of the shock with an unambiguous tracer for the first time. The Br$\gamma$ emission is concentrated in the central $\lesssim$100 pc, indicating that any remaining star-formation in NGC 1266 is in the nucleus while the surrounding cold molecular gas has little on-going star-formation. Though it is unclear what fraction of this Br$\gamma$ emission is from star-formation or the AGN, assuming it is entirely due to star-formation we measure an instantaneous star-formation rate of 0.7 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, though the star-formation rate may be significantly higher in the presence of additional extinction. NGC 1266 provides a unique laboratory to study the complex interactions between AGN, outflows, shocks, and star-formation, all of which are necessary to unravel the evolution of the post-starburst phase.</description>

Abstract: Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia DR3, we detect a ~35 to 70 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. We also detect a broad, ~40 to 80 degree-long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a very similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components are each made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Implications of the Milky Way Declining Rotation Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all spiral galaxies have been observed to have flattening rotation curves. The new Gaia DR3 released data shows a Milky Way sharply Keplerian declining rotation curve, starting at $\sim 16$ kpc and ending at 26.5 kpc. The data reduces the total Milky Way mass by an order of magnitude, $M=2.06\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, compared to the standard required dark matter halo mass, $(2-5)\times10^{12}M_\odot$. Newtonian and modified gravity (MOG) fits are applied to the Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. The fit obtained using MOG has a total mass of $M\sim1.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, while the Newtonian fit predicts a mass of $M\sim2\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$. These are in excess of the estimated visible baryon mass of the Milky Way, $M_b\sim (0.6-1.0)\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$. It is possible that if the cicumgalactic (CGM) plasma-gas continues to be confirmed experimentally, then the additional baryon mass required to account for the estimated total Milky Way mass could be attributed to the CGM hot plasma-gas halo.</description>

      <title>A census of dwarf galaxy satellites around LMC-mass galaxy NGC 2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D=3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ~110 kpc, or ~80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ~2.5 mags of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to M_V ~ -7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Search for Strongly Lensed Quasars in KiDS DR5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\tt{MAG\_AUTO} &lt; 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Magnetised HI superbubbles in the Small Magellanic Cloud revealed by the POSSUM pilot survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) bubbles and shells are common in the interstellar medium (ISM). Studying their properties provides insight into the characteristics of the local ISM as well as the galaxy in which the bubbles reside. We report the detection of magnetic fields associated with superbubbles in the nearby irregular galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Using the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) pilot survey, we obtain a high-density grid ($\approx 25 \,\rm sources\,deg^{-2}$) of Faraday rotation measure (RM) from polarized sources behind the SMC. This provides a sufficiently large number of RM measurements to study the magnetic properties of three of the largest HI shells previously identified in the SMC. The RM profiles as a function of distance from the shell centre show characteristic patterns at angular scales comparable to the shell size. We demonstrate that this can be explained by magneto-hydrodynamic simulation models of bubbles expanding in magnetised environments. From the observations, we estimate the line-of-sight magnetic field strength at the edges of the shells is enhanced by $\sim1\,\rm \mu G$ with respect to their centres. This is an order of magnitude larger than the field strength in the ambient medium ($\sim 0.1\,\rm \mu G$) estimated based on the expansion velocity of the shells. This paper highlights the power of densely mapped RM grids in studying the magnetic properties of galactic substructures beyond the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: deep spectral line observations of the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIGHTEE survey utilises the South African MeerKAT radio telescope to observe four extragalactic deep fields, with the aim of advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. MIGHTEE's frequency coverage encompasses the $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ line to a redshift of z $\simeq$ 0.58, and OH megamasers to z $\simeq$ 0.9. We present the MIGHTEE-$\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ imaging products for the COSMOS field, using a total of 94.2 h on-target and a close-packed mosaic of 15 individual pointings. The spectral imaging covers two broad, relatively interference-free regions (960-1150 and 1290-1520~MHz) within MeerKAT's L-band, with up to 26 kHz spectral resolution (5.5 km s$^{-1}$ at $z$ = 0). The median noise in the highest spectral resolution data is 74 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 5$\sigma$ $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ mass limit of 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ for a 300 km s$^{-1}$ line at $z$ = 0.07. The mosaics cover $&gt;$4 deg$^{2}$, provided at multiple angular resolution / sensitivity pairings, with an angular resolution for $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ at $z$ = 0 of 12$''$. We describe the spectral line processing workflow that will be the basis for future MIGHTEE-$\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ products, and validation of, and some early results from, the spectral imaging of the COSMOS field. We find no evidence for line emission at the position of the $z$ = 0.376 \HI~line reported from the CHILES survey at a $&gt;$94 per cent confidence level, placing a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 8.1 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ on $M_{\mathrm{HI}}$ for this galaxy.

      <title>A Giant Disk Galaxy Two Billion Years After The Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational studies showed that galaxy disks are already in place in the first few billion years of the universe. The early disks detected so far, with typical half-light radii of 3 kiloparsecs at stellar masses around 10^11 M_sun for redshift z~3, are significantly smaller than today's disks with similar masses, in agreement with expectations from current galaxy models. Here, we report observations of a giant disk at z=3.25, when the universe was only 2 billion years old, with a half-light radius of 9.6 kiloparsecs and stellar mass of 3.7^+2.6_-2.2x10^11 M_sun. This galaxy is larger than any other kinematically-confirmed disks at similar epochs and surprisingly similar to today's largest disks regarding size and mass. JWST imaging and spectroscopy reveal its spiral morphology and a rotational velocity consistent with local Tully-Fisher relation. Multi-wavelength observations show that it lies in an exceptionally dense environment, where the galaxy number density is over ten times higher than the cosmic average and mergers are frequent. The discovery of such a giant disk suggests the presence of favorable physical conditions for large-disk formation in dense environments in the early universe, which may include efficient accretion of gas carrying coherent angular momentum and non-destructive mergers between exceptionally gas-rich progenitor galaxies.</description>

      <title>Radio-FIR correlation- A probe into cosmic ray propagation in the nearby galaxy IC 342</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved studies of the correlation between the radio and far-infrared (FIR) emission from galaxies at different frequencies can unveil the interplay between star formation and relativistic interstellar medium (ISM). Thanks to the LOFAR LoTSS observations combined with the VLA, Herschel, and WISE data, we study the role of the cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the radio-FIR correlation on scales of ~&gt; 200 pc in the nearby galaxy IC342. The thermal emission traced by the 22 micron emission, constitutes about 6%, 13%, and 30% of the observed radio emission at 0.14, 1.4, 4.8 GHz, respectively, in star forming regions and less in other parts. The nonthermal spectral index becomes flatter at frequencies lower than 1.4 GHz (a=-0.51 +- 0.09, S(nu)~ nu^(a)) than between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz (a = -1.06+- 0.19) on average and this flattening occurs not only in star-forming regions but also in diffuse ISM. The radio-FIR correlation holds at all radio frequencies; however, it is tighter at higher radio frequencies. A multi-scale analysis shows that this correlation cannot be maintained on small scales due to diffusion of cosmic ray electrons (CREs). The correlation breaks on a larger scale (320 pc) at 0.14 GHz than at 1.4 GHz (200 pc) indicating that those CREs traced at lower frequencies have diffused a longer path in the ISM. We find that the energy index of CREs becomes flatter in star forming regions in agreement with previous studies. Cooling of CREs due to the magnetic field is evident globally only after compensating for the effect of star formation activity which both accelerate CREs and amplify magnetic fields. Compared with other nearby galaxies, it is shown that the smallest scale of the radio-FIR correlation is proportional to the CREs propagation length on which the ordered magnetic field has an important effect.</description>

      <title>Combined JWST-MUSE Integral Field Spectroscopy of the Most Luminous Quasar in the Local Universe, PDS 456</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast accreting, extremely luminous quasars contribute heavily to the feedback process within galaxies. While these systems are most common at cosmic noon ($z\sim2$), here we choose to study PDS 456, an extremely luminous ($L_{bol}\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) but nearby ($z\sim0.185$) quasar where the physics of feedback can be studied in greater detail. We present the results from our analysis of the JWST MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data of this object. The extreme brightness of PDS 456 makes it challenging to study the extended emission even in this nearby object. MIRI/MRS instrumental effects are mitigated by using complementary NIRSpec and MUSE IFS data cubes. We show clear evidence of a multiphase gas outflow extending up to 15 kpc from the central source. This includes emission from warm molecular (H$_2$ $\nu$ = 0 $-$ 0 and 1 $-$ 0) and ionized (e.g. Pa$\alpha$, [O III], [Ne III], [Ne VI]) gas with typical blueshifted velocities down to $-500$ km s$^{-1}$. We are also able to probe the nuclear dust emission in this source through silicate and PAH emission features but are unable to spatially resolve it. Our results are consistent with this powerful quasar driving a radiatively driven wind over a broad range of distances and altering the ionization structure of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The importance of nuclear star clusters for massive black hole growth and nuclear star formation in simulated low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed low-mass galaxies with nuclear star clusters (NSCs) can host accreting massive black holes (MBH). We present simulations of dwarf galaxies ($M_{\mathrm{baryon}} \sim 0.6 - 2.4 \times 10^8 \rm \, M_\odot$) at solar mass resolution ($0.5\rm \, M_\odot &lt; m_{\mathrm{gas}} &lt; 4 \rm \, M_\odot$) with a multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and investigate the impact of NSCs on MBH growth and nuclear star formation (SF). The Griffin simulation model includes non-equilibrium low temperature cooling, chemistry and the effect of HII regions and supernovae (SN) from massive stars. Individual stars are sampled down to 0.08 $\rm M_\odot$ and their non-softened gravitational interactions with MBHs are computed with the regularised Ketju integrator. MBHs with masses in the range of $10^2 - 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$ are represented by accreting sink particles without feedback. We find that the presence of NSCs boost nuclear SF (i.e. NSC growth) and MBH accretion by funneling gas to the central few parsecs. Low-mass MBHs grow more rapidly on $\sim 600$ Myr timescales, exceeding their Eddington rates at peak accretion. MBH accretion and nuclear SF is episodic (i.e. leads to multiple stellar generations), coeval and regulated by SN explosions. On 40 - 60 Myr timescales the first SN of each episode terminates MBH accretion and nuclear SF. Without NSCs, low-mass MBHs do not grow and MBH accretion and reduced nuclear SF become irregular and uncorrelated. This study gives the first insights into the possible co-evolution of MBHs and NSCs in low-mass galaxies and highlights the importance of considering dense NSCs in galactic studies of MBH growth.</description>

      <title>Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material is a potential way to further test this finding.</description>

      <title>JOYS+ study of solid state $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratios in protostellar envelopes: Observations of CO and CO$_2$ ice with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbon isotope ratio is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of stellar systems. Recent detections of CO isotopologues in disks and exoplanet atmospheres pointed towards significant fractionation in these systems. In order to understand the evolution of this quantity, it is crucial to trace the isotope abundance from stellar nurseries to planetary systems. During the protostellar stage the multiple vibrational modes of CO$_2$ and CO ice provide a unique opportunity to examine the carbon isotope ratio in the solid state. Now with the sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, these absorption features have become accessible at high S/N in Solar-mass systems. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ and the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios in 17 class 0/I low mass protostars from the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination modes (2.70 ${\mu}$m and 2.77 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.27 ${\mu}$m), the $^{13}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.39 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ bending mode (15.2 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO stretching mode (4.67 ${\mu}$m) and the $^{13}$CO stretching mode (4.78 ${\mu}$m) using JWST observations. We also report a detection of the $^{12}$CO overtone mode at 2.35 ${\mu}$m. The $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios are in agreement and we find mean ratios of 85 $\pm$ 23, 76 $\pm$ 12 and 97 $\pm$ 17 for the 2.70 ${\mu}$m, 4.27 ${\mu}$m and the 15.2 ${\mu}$m bands, respectively. The main source of uncertainty stem from the error on the band strengths. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratios derived from the 4.67 ${\mu}$m bands are consistent, albeit elevated with respect to the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios and we find a mean ratio of 165 $\pm$ 52. These findings indicate that ices leave the pre-stellar stage with elevated carbon isotope ratios relative to the interstellar medium and that fractionation becomes significant during the later stages.</description>

      <title>LensWatch: II. Improved Photometry and Time Delay Constraints on the Strongly-Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx ("SN Zwicky") with HST Template Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <title>BASS XLI: the correlation between Mid-infrared emission lines and Active Galactic Nuclei emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Spitzer spectra of 140 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the hard X-rays (14-195 keV) by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift. This sample allows us to probe several orders of magnitude in black hole masses ($10^6-10^9 M_{\odot}$), Eddington ratios ($10^{-3}-1$), X-ray luminosities ($10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$), and X-ray column densities ($10^{20}-10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$). The AGN emission is expected to be the dominant source of ionizing photons with energies $\gtrsim50$ eV, and therefore high-ionization mid-infrared (MIR) emission lines such as [Ne V] 14.32, 24.32 $\mu$m and [O IV] 25.89 $\mu$m are predicted to be good proxies of AGN activity, and robust against obscuration effects. We find high detection rates ($\gtrsim85-90$ per cent) for the mid-infrared coronal emission lines in our AGN sample. The luminosities of these lines are correlated with the 14-150 keV luminosity (with a typical scatter of $\sigma \sim 0.4-0.5$ dex), strongly indicating that the mid-infrared coronal line emission is driven by AGN activity. Interestingly, we find that the coronal lines are more tightly correlated to the bolometric luminosity ($\sigma \sim 0.2-0.3$ dex), calculated from careful analysis of the spectral energy distribution, than to the X-ray luminosity. We find that the relationship between the coronal line strengths and $L_{14-150\rm\,keV}$ is independent of black hole mass, Eddington ratio and X-ray column density. This confirms that the mid-infrared coronal lines can be used as unbiased tracers of the AGN power for X-ray luminosities in the $10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ range.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Powerful Radio Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mature radio galaxies such as M87 belong to a specific subclass of active galaxies (AGN) whose evolution in time endows them with five distinguishing characteristics, including (1) low excitation emission, (2) low star formation rates, (3) high bulge stellar-velocity dispersion, (4) bright stellar nuclei, and (5) weak or nonexistent merger signatures. We show how to understand these seemingly disparate characteristics as originating from the time evolution of powerful radio quasars and describe a new model prediction that tilted accretion disks in AGN are expected to occur in bright quasars but not in other subclasses of AGN. The picture we present should be understood as the most compelling evidence for counter-rotation as a key element in feedback from accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Walking the Line: Young Stars on the Boundary of the Epsilon Cha and Lower Centaurus-Crux Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) has provided the largest and most astrometrically precise catalogue of nearby stars to date, allowing for a more complete membership census of nearby, young stellar moving groups. These loose associations of young (age $&lt;$100 Myr) stars within $\sim$100 pc are vital laboratories for the study of the early evolution of low-mass stars and planetary systems. We have exploited DR3 data to examine the boundary region between two of the youngest nearby moving groups, the $\sim$3--8 Myr-old $\epsilon$ Cha Association (ECA) and an $\sim$8 Myr-old sub-population of the sprawling Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) young star complex. Using spatio-kinematic and color-magnitude criteria designed to select stars in the ECA, we identify $\sim$54 new young-star candidates that extend from the ECA core to the southern edge of the LCC. Included among our new candidates are six previously unidentified ultra-low-mass, mid- to late-M stars, lying near the future hydrogen-burning limit, that display significant infrared excesses. Our spatial, kinematic, and CMD analysis of these new candidates and previously established LCC and ECA members blurs the boundary between these groups and provides evidence for a wave of continuous star formation extending from north (LCC) to south (ECA). We discuss the factors which studies of nearby young moving groups must consider when constraining the ages of stars in these groups.</description>

      <title>Red giant - jet collisions in galactic nuclei I: 3D hydrodynamical model of a few stellar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several models have been proposed to explain missing red giants (RGs) near the Galactic centre. Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts, among other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during their repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2020). In this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of this phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear jet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10 passages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$ and 2 passages for $10^{-2}\,\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet behaves with time as $\Delta M_{\star}\propto \sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated mass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is $\sim 10^4\,M_{\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation for the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ as in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of $10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred from $\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are significantly lower than analytical values. For the smallest orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar surface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10 passages from $\sim 3600\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\sim 8500\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type A). RG-jet interactions can thus lead to observable changes in the nuclear late-type stellar population.</description>

      <title>Advanced Classification of Hot Subdwarf Binaries Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Gaia DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs are compact blue evolved objects, burning helium in their cores surrounded by a tiny hydrogen envelope. Most models agree on a common envelope binary evolution scenario in the Red Giant phase. However, the binarity rate for these objects is yet unsolved. We aim to develop a novel classification method for identifying hot subdwarf binaries within large datasets using Artificial Intelligence methods and Gaia DR3 data. The results will be compared with those obtained previously using VOSA (Virtual Observatory Sed Analyzer) on coincident samples. The methods include several machine learning techniques. We used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify 3084 hot subdwarf stars based on their color-magnitude properties. Of these, 2815 objects have Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP spectra, which were classified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The findings demonstrate a high agreement level (70-90%) with VOSA's classification, indicating that machine learning methods effectively classify sources with an accuracy comparable to human inspection or non-AI techniques. SVM in a radial basis function achieves 70.97% reproducibility for binary targets using photometry. CNN reaches 84.94% for binary detection using spectroscopy. We also found that the single-binary differences are especially observable on the infrared flux in our GDR3 BP/BR spectra, at wavelengths larger than 700 nm. We found that all our methods are effective in discerning between single and binary systems and are consistent with the results previously obtained with VOSA. In global terms, considering all quality metrics, CNN is the method that provides the best accuracy. The methods are also effective for detecting peculiarities in the spectra. Further research is needed to refine our techniques and enhance automated classification reliability, especially for large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background by pulsar timing array observations of both the background and individual supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) are long sought by pulsar timing array experiments (PTAs), in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. The evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution ($\propto(1+z)^{2.07}$) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is $\sim85\%$ or 64% if using a period of 3.4-year CPTA observation data, with an expectation of $\sim1.9$ or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq3$ or $5$, and it is expected to increase to $&gt;95\%$ if extending the observation period to $5$ years or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as $\sim10\%$, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of $\sim10$ years. A non-detection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>CARRSSPipeline: Flux Calibration and Non-linear Reprojection for SALT-RSS Multi-Object Spectroscopy over 3500-9500 {\AA}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) offers multi-object spectroscopy over an 8' field-of-view at resolutions up to 3000. Reduction is typically conducted using RSSMOSPipeline, which performs basic data calibrations, sky subtraction, and wavelength calibration. However, flux calibration of SALT-RSS using spectrophotometric standard star observations is difficult due to variable primary mirror illumination. We describe a novel approach where stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra are included as alignment stars on RSS slitmasks and then used to perform flux calibration of the resulting data. RSS offers multiple settings that can be pieced together to cover the entire optical range, utilizing grating angle dithers to fill chip gaps. We introduce a non-linear reprojection routine that defines an exponential wavelength array spanning 3500-9500 Angstroms with gradually decreasing resolution and then reprojects several individual settings into a single 2D spectrum for each object. Our flux calibration and non-linear reprojection routines are released as part of the Calibration And Reprojection for RSS Pipeline (CARRSSPipeline; https://github.com/GeorgeTheGeorgian/CARRSSPipeline.git ), that enables the extraction of full-optical-coverage, flux-calibrated, medium-resolution one-dimensional spectra.</description>

      <title>The sub-critical illusion: synthetic Zeeman effect observations from galactic zoom-in simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass-to-flux ratios measured via the Zeeman effect suggest the existence of a transition from a magnetically sub-critical state in HI clouds to a super-critical state in molecular clouds. However, due to projection, chemical, and excitation effects, Zeeman measurements are subject to a number of biases, and may not reflect the true relations between gravitational and magnetic energies. In this paper, we carry out simulations of the formation of magnetised molecular clouds, zooming in from an entire galaxy to sub-pc scales, which we post-process to produce synthetic HI and OH Zeeman measurements. The mass-to-flux ratios we recover from the simulated observations show a transition in magnetic criticality that closely matches observations, but we find that the gravitational-magnetic energy ratios on corresponding scales are mostly super-critical, even in the HI regime. We conclude that HI clouds in the process of assembling to form molecular clouds are already super-critical even before H_2 forms, and that the apparent transition from sub- to super-criticality between HI and H_2 is primarily an illusion created by chemical and excitation biases affecting the Zeeman measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present GeMS/GSAOI observations of five fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies with sub-arcsecond localizations. We examine and quantify their spatial distributions and locations with respect to their host galaxy light distributions, finding a median host-normalized offset of 2.09 r_e and in fainter regions of the host. When combined with the FRB sample from Mannings et al. (2021), we find that FRBs are statistically distinct from Ca-rich transients in terms of light and from SGRBs and LGRBs in terms of host-normalized offset. We further find that most FRBs are in regions of elevated local stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of their hosts. This, in combination with the combined FRB sample trace the distribution of stellar mass, points towards a possible similarity of the environments of CC-SNe and FRBs. We also find that 4/5 FRB hosts exhibit distinct spiral arm features, and the bursts originating from such hosts tend to appear on or close to the spiral structure of their hosts, with a median distance of 0.53 kpc. With many well-localized FRB detections looming on the horizon, we will be able to better characterize the properties of FRB environments relative to their host galaxies and other transient classes.</description>

Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary Z-wise/S-wise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We similarly identify no evidence for a "hemisphere anisotropy" that neglects the angular dependence of the dipole. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value modelling of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed an intriguing population of bright galaxies at high redshifts. In this work, we use extreme-value statistics to calculate the distribution (in UV magnitude) of the brightest galaxies in the redshift range $9 \lesssim z \lesssim 16$. We combine the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) approach with modelling of the galaxy luminosity function. We obtain predictions of the brightest galaxies for a suite of luminosity functions, including the Schechter and double power law functions, as well as a model parametrised by the stellar formation efficiency $f_*$. We find that the JWST data is broadly consistent with $f_*$ of $5\%-10\%$, and that the brightest galaxy at $z\sim16$ will have $M_{\rm UV}\approx -23.5^{0.8}_{0.4}$. If $f_*$ is dependent on halo mass, we predict $M_{\rm UV}\approx -22.5^{0.5}_{1.5}$ for such an object. We show that extreme-value statistics not only predicts the magnitude of the brightest galaxies at high redshifts, but may also be able to distinguish between models of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Blueprint for the Milky Way's Stellar Populations. V. 3D Local Dust Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a grid of empirically calibrated synthetic spectra developed in our previous study, we construct an all-sky 3D extinction map from the large collection of low-resolution XP spectra in Gaia DR3. Along each line of sight, with an area ranging from $0.2$ to $13.4$ deg$^2$, we determine both the reddening and metallicity of main-sequence stars and model the foreground extinction up to approximately $3$ kpc from the Sun. Furthermore, we explore variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio in our parameter search and identify its mean systematic change across diverse cloud environments in both hemispheres. In regions outside the densest parts of the clouds, our reddening estimates are validated through comparisons with previous reddening maps. However, a notable discrepancy arises when compared to other independent work based on XP spectra, although our metallicity scale shows reasonable agreement with the high-resolution spectroscopic abundance scale. We also assess the accuracy of the XP spectra by applying our calibrated models, and confirm an increasing trend of flux overestimation at shorter wavelengths below $400$ nm.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-Subaru. II. Diverse Populations of Circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circumgalactic Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) nebulae are gaseous halos around galaxies exhibiting luminous extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This work investigates Ly$\alpha$ nebulae from deep imaging of $\sim12~\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky, targeted by the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey. Utilizing the wide-field capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), we present one of the largest blind Ly$\alpha$ nebula selections, including QSO nebulae, Ly$\alpha$ blobs, and radio galaxy nebulae down to typical $2\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness of $(5-10)\times10^{-18}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. The sample contains 117 nebulae with Ly$\alpha$ sizes of 40 - 400 kpc, and the most gigantic one spans about 365 kpc, referred to as the Ivory Nebula. Combining multiwavelength data, we investigate diverse nebula populations and associated galaxies. We find a small fraction of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae have QSOs ($\sim7\%$), luminous infrared galaxies ($\sim1\%$), and radio galaxies ($\sim 2\%$). Remarkably, among the 28 enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe) exceeding 100 kpc, about 80\% are associated with UV-faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{UV} &gt; -22$), categorized as Type II ELANe. We underscore that Type II ELANe constitute the majority but remain largely hidden in current galaxy and QSO surveys. Dusty starburst and obscured AGN activity are proposed to explain the nature of Type II ELANe. The SED of stacking all Ly$\alpha$ nebulae also reveals signs of massive dusty star-forming galaxies with obscured AGNs. We propose a model to explain the dusty nature where the diverse populations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae capture massive galaxies at different evolutionary stages undergoing violent assembling. Ly$\alpha$ nebulae provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of today's massive cluster galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>The supermassive black hole merger driven evolution of high-redshift red nuggets into present-day cored early-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very compact ($R_\mathrm{e}\lesssim1$ kpc) massive quiescent galaxies (red nuggets) are more abundant in the high-redshift Universe ($z\sim2$-$3$) than today. Their size evolution can be explained by collisionless dynamical processes in galaxy mergers which, however, fail to reproduce the diffuse low-density central cores in the local massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use sequences of major and minor merger N-body simulations starting with compact spherical and disk-like progenitor models to investigate the impact of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the evolution of the galaxies. With the KETJU code we accurately follow the collisional interaction of the SMBHs with the nearby stellar population and the collisionless evolution of the galaxies and their dark matter halos. We show that only models including SMBHs can simultaneously explain the formation of low-density cores up to sizes of $R_\mathrm{b} \sim 1.3$ kpc with mass deficits in the observed range and the rapid half-mass size evolution. In addition, the orbital structure in the core region (tangentially biased orbits) is consistent with observation-based results for local cored ETGs. The displacement of stars by the SMBHs boost the half-mass size evolution by up to a factor of two and even fast rotating progenitors (compact quiescent disks) lose their rotational support after $6$-$8$ mergers. We conclude that the presence of SMBHs is required for merger driven evolution models of high redshift red nuggets into local ETGs.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve neural network (NN) predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. Building on NNs developed in Chittenden &amp; Tojeiro (2023), trained on hydrodynamical simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, which predict time-resolved star formation and stellar metallicity histories for central and satellite galaxies based solely on the properties and evolution of their dark matter halos and environments, this approach successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a powerful framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the galaxy formation histories predicted by a neural network in pure dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark matter only cosmological simulations, using the predictive semi-recurrent neural network outlined in Chittenden and Tojeiro (2023), and using stochastic improvements presented in our companion paper: Behera, Tojeiro and Chittenden (2024). We apply these methods to the dark matter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial for low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass progenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.</description>
