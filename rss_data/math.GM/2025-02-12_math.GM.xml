      <title>Generalized Neural Network Operators with Symmetrized Activations: Fractional Convergence and the Voronovskaya-Damasclin Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the asymptotic behavior of univariate neural network operators, with an emphasis on both classical and fractional differentiation over infinite domains. The analysis leverages symmetrized and perturbed hyperbolic tangent activation functions to investigate basic, Kantorovich, and quadrature-type operators. Voronovskaya-type expansions, along with the novel Vonorovskaya-Damasclin theorem, are derived to obtain precise error estimates and establish convergence rates, thereby extending classical results to fractional calculus via Caputo derivatives. The study delves into the intricate interplay between operator parameters and approximation accuracy, providing a comprehensive framework for future research in multidimensional and stochastic settings. This work lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of neural network operators in complex mathematical.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of the Quanta Prime Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Quanta Prime Sequence (QPS) and its foundational theorem, showcasing a unique class of polynomials with substantial implications. The study uncovers profound connections between Quanta Prime numbers and essential sequences in number theory and cryptography. The investigation highlights the sequence's contribution to the emergence of new primes and its embodiment of core mathematical constructs, including Mersenne numbers, Fermat numbers, Lucas numbers, Fibonacci numbers, the Chebyshev sequence, and the Dickson sequence. The comprehensive analysis emphasizes the sequence's intrinsic relevance to the Lucas-Lehmer primality test. This research positions the Quanta Prime sequence as a pivotal tool in cryptographic applications, offering novel representations of critical mathematical structures. Additionally, a new result linking the Quanta Prime sequence to the Harmonic series is introduced, hinting at potential progress in understanding the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Gauss Circle Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin, the Gauss Circle Problem concerns counting the number of lattice points $C(r)$ within this circle. It is known that as $r$ grows large, the number of lattice points approaches $\pi r^2$, that is, the area of the circle. The present research is to study how often $C(r)$ will return a prime number of lattice points for $r \leq n$. The Prime Number Theorem predicts that the number of primes less than or equal to $n$ is asymptotic to $\frac{n}{\log n}$. We find that the number of Gauss Circle Primes for $r \leq n$ is also of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for $n \leq 2 \times 10^6$. We include a heuristic argument that the Gauss Circle Primes can be approximated by $\frac{n}{\log n}$.</description>

      <title>Observations towards a proof of the Collatz conjecture using $2^{j}k+x$ number series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The document tries to put focus on sequences with certain properties and periods leading to the first value smaller than the starting value in the Collatz problem. With the idea that, if all starting numbers lead ultimately to a smaller number, all full sequences lead to 1 with a finite stopping time, the problem could be reduced to more structured shorter sequences. It is shown that this sequences exist and follow consistent rules. Potential features of an infinite cycle, also leading to a smaller number, are also discussed. Further, an argument for only one possible closed cycle is given for the special sequence of alternating odd and even steps as well as arguments that infinite cycles must exist. Using the observation that periodic behavior is exists an additional argument is provided that as an estimate 0.0222% or subsets of possibly even of N will indeed end up in an infinite cycle in the Collatz problem. The work is to be seen as in progress and shared as an contribution to discussion rather than a concrete publication.</description>
