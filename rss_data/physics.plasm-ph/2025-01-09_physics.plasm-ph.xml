      <title>Generally relativistic description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many theoretical models were come up with to figure out the properties of magnetic reconnection process, among which the Sweet-Parker model is the most famous since it describes the magnetic reconnection in a concise way. However, the low reconnection rate expected by this model is generally not available in most astrophysical systems, which motivates people to seek fast reconnection models. Under the scheme of generalized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for pair plasma, a fast magnetic reconnection model was established, in which the thermal electromotive force plays a key role to remarkably increase the reconnection rate. In this work, I would like to extend the discussions in my previous work, about the generally relativistic description of Sweet-Parker model, to the description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force. I will revisit the fast reconnection model briefly to initialize my discussions and show how the thermal electromotive force impacts the reconnection rate. Next, some basic setups will be exhibited before discussing specific examples about how the properties of fast magnetic reconnection are modified by gravitational effect or in observations. Results in this work consolidate my opinion reiterated in my previous work that properties of magnetic reconnection would never be modified by gravitational effect significantly if the magnetic reconnection process occurs in a local scale while the modifications of properties could not be neglected when the process is detected by an observer who is moving with respect to the laboratory, in the rest frame of which the magnetic reconnection occurs.</description>

      <title>A multi-purpose reciprocating probe drive system for studying the effect of gas-puffs on edge plasma dynamics in the ADITYA-U tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports the development of a versatile high-speed reciprocating drive system (HRDS) with interchangeable probe heads to characterize the edge plasma region of ADITYA-U tokamak. This reciprocating probe drive system consisting of Langmuir and magnetic probe heads, is designed, fabricated, installed, and operated for studying the extent of fuel/impurity gas propagation and its influence on plasma dynamics in the far-edge region inside the last closed magnetic flux surface (LCFS). The HRDS is driven by a highly accurate, easy-to-control, dynamic, brushless, permanently excited synchronous servo motor operated by a PXI-commanded controller. The system is remotely operated and allows for precise control of the speed, acceleration, and distance traveled of the probe head on a shot-to-shot basis, facilitating seamless control of operations according to experimental requirements. Using this system, consisting of a linear array of Langmuir probes, measurements of plasma density, temperature, potential, and their fluctuations revealed that the fuel gas-puff impact these mean and fluctuating parameters up to three to four cm inside the LCFS. Attaching an array of magnetic probes to this system led to measurements of magnetic fluctuations inside the LCFS. The HRDS system is fully operational and serves as an important diagnostic tool for ADITYA-U tokamak.</description>

      <title>Fast physics-based launcher optimization for electron cyclotron current drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased urgency to design fusion pilot plants, fast optimization of electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) launchers is paramount. Traditionally, this is done by coarsely sampling the 4-D parameter space of possible launch conditions consisting of (1) the launch location (constrained to lie along the reactor vessel), (2) the launch frequency, (3) the toroidal launch angle, and (4) the poloidal launch angle. For each initial condition, a ray-tracing simulation is performed to evaluate the ECCD efficiency. Unfortunately, this approach often requires millions of simulations to build up a dataset that adequately covers the plasma volume, which must then be repeated every time the design point changes. Here we adopt a different approach. Rather than launching rays from the plasma periphery and hoping for the best, we instead directly reconstruct the optimal ray for driving current at a given flux surface using a reduced physics model coupled with a commercial ray-tracing code. Repeating this throughout the plasma volume requires only hundreds of simulations, constituting a ten-thousand-fold speedup. The new method is validated on two separate example tokamak profiles, and is shown to reliably drive localized current at the specified flux surface with the same optimal efficiency as obtained from the traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Coil geometry with large openings for a HSR3-like stellarator reactor for fast replacement of in-vessel components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced stellarators require convoluted modular coils to produce a plasma with satisfactory performance. Moreover, the number of coils is sometimes high to decrease the modular ripple created by the coils. For reactor stellarators, these requirements imply relatively small ports for in-vessel access and maintenance, i.e. in comparison with tokamaks. The blankets and divertor modules will have to be replaced periodically (about each 1-4 years depending on the design) due to neutron damage, and also erosion of divertor targets. Blanket modules are activated, thus, all the maintenance operations have to be produced remotely. In order to reduce the shutdown time and cost during component replacement, and to reduce the number, speed and other specifications of the remote maintenance equipment, the number of blanket modules in the reactor should be low and thus, the blanket modules should be large (in relation to the minor and major radius). Nevertheless, the size of the openings between coils limits the maximum size of the blanket and divertor modules, though several potential enhancements have been proposed in the past for stellarators, like straightening the outboard segments of the coils and the movement and/or expansion of certain coils to have wider access. The present work reports on a coil geometry for the 'Helias Stellarator Reactor' (HSR) of three periods (HSR3) with coils located far from the plasma at the outboard region of the straight-like sector. This feature creates natural wide openings at such regions of the coils, which may be utilized to allow access to large blanket and divertor modules.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws: Learning Magnetohydrodynamics from 3D Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of dynamical models from data represents a crucial step in advancing our understanding of physical systems. Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate deep into Earth's atmosphere, where they impart their temporal characteristics to diffuse aurorae. Using radar-observations of the ionospheric E-region and satellite observations from the magnetosphere, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale ionospheric plasma turbulence observed a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal relaxation in warm ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform microscopic simulations of the thermal relaxation of warm neutral plasmas of astrophysical importance. Using Molecular Dynamics we study the thermal relaxation of a hot neutral fluid of finite-size neutron-rich ions kept in a fixed-wall cool box. We show how the interplay among particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understand the features of the time-dependent thermal relaxation curve $T(t)$. We show that, under certain conditions, these systems exhibit faster cooling from increasingly larger initial temperature values. They also display non-Newtonian thermal behavior, including oscillations, that can be {\it effectively} interpreted as the consequence of the existence of a non-trivial system memory function. Finally, we consider the impact of multicomponent admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and their possible extensions to astrophysical scenarios, where screened plasmas with Yukawa-like electrostatic potentials are usually involved.</description>
