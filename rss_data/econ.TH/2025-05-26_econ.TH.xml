      <title>Accuracy Is (Generically) Bad For Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the set of cost distributions under which the optimal strategy for maximizing compliance (or more generally, effort) in a binary choice environment is identical to the optimal strategy for maximizing the accuracy of the reward (minimizing Type-I and Type-II errors) is finitely shy (Anderson and Zame (2001) in the space of all smooth parameterized real-valued distributions possessing full support on the real line. In words, this implies that maximizing compliance and maximizing accuracy "almost always" call for different incentive schemes.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for a dynamic many-to-many school choice problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the problem of assigning teachers to public schools over time when teachers have tenured positions and can work simultaneously in multiple schools. To do this, we investigate a dynamic many-to-many school choice problem where public schools have priorities over teachers and teachers hold path-independent choice functions selecting subsets of schools. We introduce a new concept of dynamic stability that recognizes the tenured positions of teachers and we prove that a dynamically stable matching always exists. We propose the Tenure-Respecting Deferred Acceptance (TRDA) mechanism, which produces a dynamically stable matching that is constrained-efficient within the class of dynamically stable matchings and minimizes unjustified claims. To improve efficiency beyond this class, we also propose the Tenure-Respecting Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance (TREADA) mechanism, an adaptation of the Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance mechanism to our dynamic context. We demonstrate that the outcome of the TREADA mechanism Pareto-dominates any dynamically stable matching and achieves efficiency when all teachers consent. Additionally, we examine the issue of manipulability, showing that although the TRDA and TREADA mechanisms can be manipulated, they remain non-obviously dynamically manipulable under specific conditions on schools' priorities.</description>

      <title>Paying and Persuading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the joint design of information and transfers when an informed Sender can motivate Receiver by both paying and (Bayesian) persuading. I introduce a generalized concavification method to characterize Sender's value function when they can flexibly influence Receiver incentives directly. This characterization implies empirically verifiable conditions under which Sender strictly prefers access to the joint design of information and transfers. When Sender and Receiver interact repeatedly, Sender pays Receiver only when informational incentives are exhausted, highlighting a stark substitution effect between payments and persuasion as dynamic incentive tools. I conclude by discussing implications of my results for project selection in organizations, pricing for advertisements, and rideshare design.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze incomplete-information games where an oracle publicly shares information with players. One oracle dominates another if, in every game, it can match the set of equilibrium outcomes induced by the latter. Distinct characterizations are provided for deterministic and stochastic signaling functions, based on simultaneous posterior matching, partition refinements, and common knowledge components. This study extends the work of Blackwell (1951) to games, and expands the study of Aumann (1976) on common knowledge by developing a theory of information loops.</description>
