      <title>Carlo.jl: A general framework for Monte Carlo simulations in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carlo.jl is a Monte Carlo simulation framework written in Julia. It provides MPI-parallel scheduling, organized storage of input, checkpoint, and output files, as well as statistical postprocessing. With a minimalist design, it aims to aid the development of high-quality Monte Carlo codes, especially for demanding applications in condensed matter and statistical physics. This hands-on user guide shows how to implement a simple code with Carlo.jl and provides benchmarks to show its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Review of the finite difference Hartree-Fock method for atoms and diatomic molecules, and its implementation in the x2dhf program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive review of the two-dimensional finite difference Hartree--Fock (FD HF) method, and present its implementation in the newest version of X2DHF, the FD HF program for atoms and diatomic molecules. The program was originally published in Comput. Phys. Commun. in 1996, and was last revised in 2013. X2DHF can be used to obtain HF limit values of total energies and multipole moments for a wide range of diatomic molecules and their ions, using either point nuclei or a finite nuclear model. Polarizabilities ($\alpha_{zz}$) and hyperpolarizabilities ($\beta_{zzz}$, $\gamma_{zzzz}$, ${A}_{z,zz}$, ${B}_{zz,zz}$) can also be computed by the program with the finite-field method. X2DHF has been extensively used in the literature to assess the accuracy of existing atomic basis sets and to help in developing new ones. As a new feature since the last revision, the program can now also perform Kohn-Sham density functional calculations with local and generalized gradient exchange-correlation functionals with the Libxc library of density functionals, enabling new types of studies. Furthermore, the initialization of calculations has been greatly simplified. As before, X2DHF can also perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb, Green-Sellin-Zachor and Krammers-Henneberger potentials, while calculations with a superposition of atomic potentials have been added as a new feature. The program is easy to install from the GitHub repository and build via CMake using the x2dhfctl script that facilitates creating its single- and multiple-threaded versions, as well as building in Libxc support. Calculations can be carried out with X2DHF in double- or quadruple-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Finite Volume Kernels on a Dataflow Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate numerical simulations are crucial for designing large-scale geological carbon storage projects ensuring safe long-term CO2 containment as a climate change mitigation strategy. These simulations involve solving numerous large and complex linear systems arising from the implicit Finite Volume (FV) discretization of PDEs governing subsurface fluid flow. Compounded with highly detailed geomodels, solving linear systems is computationally and memory expensive, and accounts for the majority of the simulation time. Modern memory hierarchies are insufficient to meet the latency and bandwidth needs of large-scale numerical simulations. Therefore, exploring algorithms that can leverage alternative and balanced paradigms, such as dataflow and in-memory computing is crucial. This work introduces a matrix-free algorithm to solve FV-based linear systems using a dataflow architecture to significantly minimize memory latency and bandwidth bottlenecks. Our implementation achieves two orders of magnitude speedup compared to a GPGPU-based reference implementation, and up to 1.2 PFlops on a single dataflow device.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>Machine learning supported annealing for prediction of grand canonical crystal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Factorization Machines with Quantum Annealing (FMQA) to address the crystal structure problem (CSP) in materials science. FMQA is a black-box optimization algorithm that combines machine learning with annealing machines to find samples to a black-box function that minimize a given loss. The CSP involves determining the optimal arrangement of atoms in a material based on its chemical composition, a critical challenge in materials science. We explore FMQA's ability to efficiently sample optimal crystal configurations by setting the loss function to the energy of the crystal configuration as given by a predefined interatomic potential. Further we investigate how well the energies of the various metastable configurations, or local minima of the potential, are learned by the algorithm. Our investigation reveals FMQA's potential in quick ground state sampling and in recovering relational order between local minima.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of DFT calculated mechanical and structural properties of solids due to incompatibility of pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for pseudopotentials constructed for a given exchange-correlation (XC) functional far exceeds the supply, necessitating the use of those commonly available. The number of XC functionals currently available is in the hundreds, if not thousands, and the majority of pseudopotentials have been generated for the LDA and PBE. The objective of this study is to identify the error in the determination of the mechanical and structural properties (lattice constant, cohesive energy, elastic constants, and bulk modulus) of crystals calculated by DFT with such inconsistency. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the performance of popular XC functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN) for these calculations in a consistent manner.</description>

Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility for essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. We demonstrate how our method can be used to study quantum phase transitions without knowledge of an order parameter and without the need to design system-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules by applying it to a class of random models.</description>

      <title>Early Warning Signals for Bifurcations Embedded in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the utility of methods for early warning signal detection in dynamic systems approaching critical tipping thresholds. Often these tipping points resemble local bifurcations, whose low dimensional dynamics can play out on a manifold embedded in a much higher dimensional state space. In many cases of practical relevance, the form of this embedding is poorly understood or entirely unknown. This paper explores how measurement of the critical phenomena that generically precede such bifurcations can be used to make inferences about the properties of their embeddings, and, conversely, how prior knowledge about the mechanism of bifurcation can robustify predictions of an oncoming tipping event. These modes of analysis are first demonstrated on a simple fluid flow system undergoing a Hopf bifurcation. The same approach is then applied to data associated with the West African monsoon shift, with results corroborated by existing models of the same system. This example highlights the effectiveness of the methodology even when applied to complex climate data, and demonstrates how a well-resolved spatial structure associated with the onset of atmospheric instability can be inferred purely from time series measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled porous media from particle-stabilized emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2974</link>
      <description>arXiv:1408.2974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to create self-assembled porous media with highly tunable geometrical properties and permeabilities: We first allow a particle-stabilized emulsion to form from a mixture of two fluids and colloidal particles. Then, either one fluid phase or the particle layer is solidified, which can be achieved by techniques such as polymerization or freezing. Based on computer simulations we demonstrate that modifying only the particle wettability or concentration results in porous structures with a wide range of pore sizes and a permeability that can be varied by up to three orders of magnitude. We then discuss optimization of these properties for self-assembled filters or reactors and conclude that structures based on so-called "bijels" are most suitable candidates.</description>

Abstract: Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.</description>

      <title>Material Hardness Descriptor Derived by Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardness is a materials' property with implications in several industrial fields, including oil and gas, manufacturing, and others. However, the relationship between this macroscale property and atomic (i.e., microscale) properties is unknown and in the last decade several models have unsuccessfully tried to correlate them in a wide range of chemical space. The understanding of such relationship is of fundamental importance for discovery of harder materials with specific characteristics to be employed in a wide range of fields. In this work, we have found a physical descriptor for Vickers hardness using a symbolic-regression artificial-intelligence approach based on compressed sensing. SISSO (Sure Independence Screening plus Sparsifying Operator) is an artificial-intelligence algorithm used for discovering simple and interpretable predictive models. It performs feature selection from up to billions of candidates obtained from several primary features by applying a set of mathematical operators. The resulting sparse SISSO model accurately describes the target property (i.e., Vickers hardness) with minimal complexity. We have considered the experimental values of hardness for binary, ternary, and quaternary transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboborides, and boronitrides of 61 materials, on which the fitting was performed. The found descriptor is a non-linear function of the microscopic properties, with the most significant contribution being from a combination of Voigt-averaged bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Reuss-averaged shear modulus. Results of high-throughput screening of 635 candidate materials using the found descriptor suggest the enhancement of material's hardness through mixing with harder yet metastable structures (e.g., metastable VN, TaN, ReN$_2$, Cr$_3$N$_4$, and ZrB$_6$ all exhibit high hardness).</description>
