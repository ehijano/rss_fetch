      <title>Root Cause Analysis of Radiation Oncology Incidents Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in performing root cause analysis (RCA) of radiation oncology incidents using narrative reports from the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System (RO-ILS), and to assess their potential utility in supporting patient safety efforts.
  Methods and Materials Four LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, o3, and Grok 3, were prompted with the 'Background and Incident Overview' sections of 19 public RO-ILS cases. Using a standardized prompt based on AAPM RCA guidelines, each model was instructed to identify root causes, lessons learned, and suggested actions. Outputs were assessed using semantic similarity metrics (cosine similarity via Sentence Transformers), semi-subjective evaluations (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, hallucination rate, and four performance criteria: relevance, comprehensiveness, justification, and solution quality), and subjective expert ratings (reasoning quality and overall performance) from five board-certified medical physicists.
  Results LLMs showed promising performance. GPT-4o had the highest cosine similarity (0.831), while Gemini 2.5 Pro had the highest recall (0.762) and accuracy (0.882). Hallucination rates ranged from 11% to 51%. Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed others across performance criteria and received the highest expert rating (4.8/5). Statistically significant differences in accuracy, hallucination, and subjective scores were observed (p &lt; 0.05).
  Conclusion LLMs show emerging promise as tools for RCA in radiation oncology. They can generate relevant, accurate analyses aligned with expert judgment and may support incident analysis and quality improvement efforts to enhance patient safety in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT Images from Non-Contrast Scans Using Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.</description>

      <title>Beam Geometry and Input Dimensionality: Impact on Sparse-Sampling Artifact Correction for Clinical CT with U-Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of 22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar. Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel, fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and 3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects, respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D', and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input data dimensions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion MRI invariants: from the group of rotations to a complete neuroimaging fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMR) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMR, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent ``fingerprint". Here we focus on the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMR signal, derive a complete set of 21 diffusion and covariance tensor invariants in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Conventional dMR metrics are shown to be redundant, while most of the invariants provide novel complementary information. Our complete set of invariants for the kurtosis tensor improves multiple sclerosis classification in a cohort of 1189 subjects. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine the most used invariants in only 1--2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMR signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMR into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Correlation between Force Output, Strains, and Pressure for Active Skeletal Muscle Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the forces of individual muscles in a muscle group around a joint is non-trivial, and researchers have suggested using surrogates for individual muscle forces instead. Traditionally, experimentalists have shown that the force output of the skeletal muscle tissue can be correlated to the intra-muscular pressure (IMP) generated by the muscle belly. However, IMP proves difficult to measure in vivo, due to variations from sensor placement and invasiveness of the procedure. Numerical biomechanical simulations offer a tool to analyze muscle contractions, enabling new insights into the correlations among non-invasive experimentally measurable quantities such as strains, and the force output. In this work, we investigate the correlations between the muscle force output, the principal, shear and volumetric strains experienced by the muscle, as well as the pressure developed within the muscle belly as the tissue undergoes isometric contractions with varying activation profiles and magnitudes. It is observed that pressure does not correlate well with force output under higher sub-maximal and maximal activation levels, especially at locations away from the center of the muscle belly due to pressure relaxation effects. This study reveals strong correlations between force output and the strains at all locations of the belly, irrespective of the type of activation considered. This observation offers evidence for further in vivo studies using experimentally measurable principal and volumetric strains in the muscle belly as proxies for the force generation by the individual muscle and consequently enables the estimation on the contribution of various muscle groups to the total force.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Imaging of Plant Delayed Luminescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms through the analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., $2304 \times 4096$ pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occur in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Collectively, this work establishes a theoretical and technological framework for advancing plant phenotyping under stress conditions and optimizing light environments.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Holography in the Megahertz Frequency Range with Optimal Lens Topologies and Nonlinear Acoustic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic holography in the megahertz frequency range can impact numerous applications, including manufacturing, non-destructive testing, and transcranial ultrasound. However, designing lens topologies for complex acoustic holograms in the megahertz range poses a significant challenge, as weave propagation effects through the lens cannot be ignored. Here, we show that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media, providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus. Together, our findings support the design of simple, economical, and high-performance ultrasound systems.</description>
