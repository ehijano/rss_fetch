      <title>Polarization-Resolved Chlorophyll Imaging for Non-Invasive Plant Tissue Assessment Using a Silicon-Rich Nitride Metalens Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive imaging enhances contrast and reveals structural features in biological tissues that are often missed by intensity-based methods, but its adoption is limited by bulky optics. We present a compact silicon-rich nitride (SRN) metalens array for high-resolution, polarization-resolved imaging of plant tissue at the chlorophyll absorption peak (660\,nm). The array integrates orthogonally sensitive metalenses to simultaneously capture X- and Y-linearly polarized transmission images, enabling real-time, label-free assessment of plant microstructure and stress responses. Polarization fusion and difference mapping reveal structural anisotropy and pigment variation in both healthy and stressed leaves. The SRN metalens, designed via an inverse approach using birefringent meta-atoms and fabricated through CMOS-compatible processes, achieves a large numerical aperture, high transmission, and spectral alignment with biological absorbers. This work demonstrates the feasibility of compact, integrated polarization-resolved imaging, offering a scalable alternative to conventional systems. The approach holds potential for biomedical and agricultural applications, where detecting subtle polarization-dependent changes could enable early diagnosis and tissue characterization</description>

      <title>Observation of stability of Gaussian beams and off-axis beam-cleaning in graded-index media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nonlinear effects in graded-index (GRIN) multimode fibers have been studied extensively, little is known about nonlinear effects in larger GRIN waveguides, where the number of modes approaches infinity and modal dispersion becomes negligible. Here we show that Gaussian beams remain nearly invariant even with large nonlinear phase accumulation and on- or off-axis trajectories in GRIN rods. In addition, spatially-complex beams can undergo self-cleaning to single-lobed profiles for both on- and off-axis trajectories. Numerical simulations exhibit the features observed in experiments, and a general interpretation of these results that makes connection to beam-cleaning phenomena observed in GRIN fibers is proposed.</description>

      <title>Deterministic time rewinding of waves in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal modulation of material parameters offers unprecedented control over wave dynamics, enabling phenomena beyond the capabilities of static systems. Here we introduce and analyze a robust mechanism for time rewinding, whereby a temporally evolved wave is fully restored to its original state through a carefully engineered sequence of temporal modulations. In electromagnetic systems, time rewinding emerges from impedance-matched or anti-matched hierarchical bilayer structures with matched modulation durations, exploiting total transmission or reflection and reversed phase accumulation. In Dirac systems, it arises via complete interband transition driven by time-dependent vector potentials. Unlike time-reversal holography or quantum time mirrors, which produce wave echoes but only partial waveform recovery, our approach achieves deterministic and complete reconstruction of the entire wave state, including both amplitude and phase. Analytical conditions for robust amplitude and phase restoration are derived and validated through simulations of discrete and continuous modulations, demonstrating resilience to modulation complexity and temporal asymmetry. These findings establish a versatile platform for secure information retrieval, temporal cloaking, programmable metamaterials, and wave-based logic devices.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Lattice of Photonic Spin-Meron Tubes in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the first photonic spin-meron tube lattice in free space using spin-angular momentum vectors. Square-block diffraction creates $C_{4}$-symmetric beams with $\pi/2$ phase steps. Non-paraxial spin-orbit coupling then forms finite-length meron tubes ($N_{\mathrm{sk}} \approx \pm 1/2$, $&gt; 25,\lambda$). Extending the formalism, we show that $C_{3}$ geometry of a triangular block yields a spin-skyrmion tube. Stratton-Chu theory and full-vectorial finite-difference time-domain calculations both support this material-agnostic, geometry-driven approach as a platform to explore symmetry-driven free-space topology.</description>

      <title>Generation of ultra-intense spatiotemporal optical vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) with transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) can induce some novel properties in high energy density physics. However, the current STOV pulse energy is limited to the mJ level, which greatly hinders the development of the research field of relativistic laser-matter interaction. Combined with the large-scale grating pair in high-peak-power laser facility, the method for generating of STOV with ultra-high intensity up to 1021 W/cm2 is proposed. The numerical simulation proves that the wave packet with 60 fs duration and 83 J energy can be generated in the far field, maintaining an integral spatiotemporal vortex construction. Finally, STOVs with 1.1 mJ single pulse energy were obtained in a proof-of-principle experiment, and characterized by a home-made measuring device.</description>

      <title>Research on Ultrasonic Imaging Systems Based on Scattering Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ultrasonic array system, increasing the aperture size to achieve a high resolution requires more transmit and receive channels, thus making it essential to have an analysis technique that can reconstruct the shape and physical properties of scatterers in a finite time based on measurement data obtained from numerous ultrasonic elements. Herein, we developed an ultrasound imaging technique using a two-dimensional ultrasonic array system comprising N^2 transmitter/receiver pairs and a technique for controlling it with a 2N-channel transmitter/receiver circuit. In addition, we derived a partial differential equation that describes wave propagation in the scattering field where the transmitter and receiver arrays are orthogonally arranged, based on scattering field theory. By analytically solving this equation, we derived an imaging function that incorporates the measurement data as boundary conditions. Moreover, we visualized the spatial distribution of reflection intensity corresponding to the target shape by measuring reflected waves from the target using this measurement system and performing reconstruction calculations based on scattering field theory. We demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic imaging by combining ultrasonic measurements using a smaller number of channels than the number of ultrasonic elements and scattering field theory and using the measurement results as boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Third-Harmonic Generation via Strong Coupling of Quasi-Guided Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the conversion efficiency is critical for advancing nonlinear photonic devices, enabling applications in ultrafast optics, quantum light sources, and high-resolution imaging. Herein, we present a bilayer waveguide integrated with a periodic square nanocube array to enhance third-harmonic generation (THG) efficiency. This structure achieves strong coupling between TE- and TM-polarized quasi-guided mode (QGM) resonances, thereby enabling simultaneous dynamic control of both resonant Q-factor and coupling strength through incident polarization angle. The distinct avoided crossing observed in both reflection spectra and eigenfrequency diagrams indicates the strong coupling regime. This mechanism, facilitated by the inter-mode energy exchange within the hybridized system, results in an enhancement of Q-factor by two orders of magnitude when compared to conventional guided-mode resonances. Simulation results verify an unprecedented maximum Q-factor of 10^12 for the upper-branch mode. Leveraging strong-coupling-induced field enhancement, the system attains THG conversion efficiency of order 10^-2, demonstrating unprecedented nonlinear performance.</description>

      <title>Topologically Protected Polaritonic Bound State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as powerful tools for realizing ultra-high-Q resonances in nanophotonics. While previous implementations have primarily relied on dielectric metasurfaces, they remain limited by the diffraction limit. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate and experimentally validate the existence of topologically protected phonon-polaritonic BICs in periodic arrays of cylindrical nanoresonators composed of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN), which have the availability of two restrahlen bands (lower (type-I) and upper (type II)), operating in the lower Reststrahlen band (RB-1). Owing to the uniaxial anisotropy of hBN and the rotational symmetry of the structure, these systems support topologically symmetry-protected BICs at the {\Gamma}-point, where radiative losses are fully suppressed. The total quality factor is ultimately bounded by the intrinsic phonon damping of h11BN, enabling high-Q polaritonic modes with minimal radiation leakage. When cylindrical symmetry is broken via angular tilting of incident light away from the normal incidence, these BICs transition into quasi-BICs (q-BICs) with strong field confinement and tunable radiation leakage. This topological protection enables robust control over mode lifetimes and confinement, paving the way toward scalable polaritonic platforms for mid-infrared optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Retroreflective surface optimisation for optical cavities with custom mirror profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling an emitter to a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity can provide a coherent and strong light-matter interface whose performance in a variety of applications depends critically on the emitter-photon coupling strength. Altering the typically spherical profiles of the cavity mirrors can improve this coupling strength, but directly optimising the mirror shape is numerically challenging as the multidimensional parameter space features many local optima. Here, we develop a two-step method to optimise mirror surface profiles while avoiding these issues. First, we optimise the target cavity eigenmode for the chosen application directly, and second, we construct the mirror surfaces to retroreflect this optimised target mode at both ends of the cavity. We apply our procedure to different emitter-cavity coupling scenarios. We show that mirror shaping can increase the cooperativity of coupling to a central emitter by a factor of approximately 3 across a wide range of geometries, and that, for coupling two or more emitters to a single cavity mode, the improvement factors can far exceed an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Amorphous metal oxide mixtures for high-Q integrated nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice of material is ubiquitous in integrated photonics to design device properties, whereas changing material composition is much less common. With phase matching as an additional objective, constraints in depositing and patterning thin films limit the use of integrated nonlinear photonics to only select materials. Here, we explore an amorphous metal oxide mixture of titania (TiO2) and tantala (Ta2O5) in which material composition is a tool to enhance and customize photonics properties. In particular, the inclusion of titania reduces the oxygen-defect density in a tantala film, while maintaining a comparable Kerr nonlinear index. With ion-beam sputtering at room temperature, we deposit a thick, ultralow-loss titania-tantala film, and we nanopattern it to create microresonator frequency combs. Titania-tantala microresonators offer lower loss, higher index of refraction, and reduced optical absorption and photorefractive effects. Specifically, the titania-tantala mixture enables microresonator quality factor up to $10^7$ and a direct factor of 1.7 reduction in optical absorption. Our work demonstrates that composition in metal-oxide mixtures is a design parameter alongside the nanofabrication process and photonics design for integrated nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Photonics Intelligent Design and Optimization (PhIDO), a multi-agent framework that converts natural-language photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design requests into layout mask files. We compare 7 reasoning large language models for PhIDO using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with less than or equal to 15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of approximately 57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and lowest cost. The next steps toward autonomous PIC development include standardized knowledge representations, expanded datasets, extended verification, and robotic automation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Phase-Unwrapping Methods for Adaptive Optics Wavefront Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced wavefront sensors (WFS) are essential for enabling new science cases for telescopes that utilize adaptive optics (AO) systems. While complex field WFS -- those that estimate the electric field phase and amplitude through interference or diffraction effects -- can achieve extraordinary sensitivity compared to existing devices, they typically reconstruct the wrapped phase of the measured wavefront, which must then be unwrapped for correction by continuous-surface deformable mirrors (DM). Another requirement is that the phase function must be unwrapped within 1 millisecond or faster for real-time AO operations. Using simulations of atmospheric turbulence that follow a Kolmogorov spectrum, we study four prevalent and mature phase unwrapping methods: Fast2D, Zernike Gradient (Zernike), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Least Squares Principle Value (LSPV). In this paper, we examine the strengths and limitations of each method. In particular, we consider performance with and without a binary circular aperture boundary that defines the edge of monolithic telescopes.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped ultrabright entangled photons on chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPS) are essential for quantum science and technology. Despite advancements in integrated optical platforms like thin-film lithium niobate, a scalable, high-performance, chip-scale EPS has remained elusive. We address this by demonstrating an electrically pumped, post-selection-free polarization-EPS, achieved through hybrid integration of a distributed feedback laser with thin-film lithium niobate chip which integrates periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, beam splitter, and polarization rotator combiner. By injecting current into the chip, we realize a high-performance EPS with a bandwidth of 73 nm and an entanglement pair generation rate of 4.5*10^10 pairs/s/mW. The polarization entanglement shows Bell-state fidelities above 96% across frequency-correlated modes. This compact, integrated EPS enables key applications, including high-speed quantum key distribution via wavelength division multiplexing, satellite-based quantum communication, and entanglement-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced imaging through scattering media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering in complex media scrambles light, obscuring images and hindering applications ranging from astronomy to microscopy. While computational algorithms and wavefront shaping can, in principle, reverse this mixing by exploiting the near-linear nature of light propagation, in practice the inversion process is highly susceptible to limitations such as the finite number of controllable modes, noise, losses, and inaccuracies in the forward model. Consequently, these approaches are only effective under tightly controlled conditions, limiting their impact on real-world imaging. Here, we present a quantum entanglement-based approach that transmits images through complex media without inverting the scattering process. This method exploits a fundamental property of quantum entanglement: the preservation of photon correlations across multiple measurement bases. By tailoring the optical disorder induced by a scattering layer to access one such basis, entanglement-encoded images of arbitrary objects hidden behind the medium can be reconstructed via coincidence detection at the output. In contrast, classical imaging under identical conditions fails, producing only speckle patterns with no object information. Our work introduces a fundamentally new approach to imaging through complex media by leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement beyond simple optical correlations. This opens up new avenues for quantum-enhanced imaging and communication in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Bright 25-attosecond light pulses reach the one atomic unit of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating ever-shorter and brighter light pulses has long been a central pursuit in ultrafast science, as it benchmarks our ability to create and manipulate the coherence on the intrinsic timescale of sub-atomic electron motion. The current state-of-the-art in attosecond pulse generation reaches durations of 40-50 attoseconds (1 as = $10^{-18}$ seconds), produced via high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by secondary mid-infrared light sources. However, these sources often suffer from low stability and poor HHG conversion efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of 25$\pm$2 attosecond light pulses, a new world record for the shortest light pulse, driven by a post-compressed, industrial-grade Yb-based laser system. The resulting high-harmonic spectrum spans photon energies from 50 eV to 320 eV, covering the carbon K-edge, with a calibrated photon flux exceeding $10^{12}$ photons per second, approximately three orders of magnitude higher than previous studies. The pulse duration was characterized using an angle-resolved photoelectron streaking camera on helium atoms and systematically optimized through the use of dielectric filters of varying thicknesses to compensate the attochirp. Our study reaches the threshold of one atomic unit of time (24.2 attoseconds), the boundary between atomic and ionic physics, opening the door to resolving exciting ionic quantum dynamics with tabletop lasers.</description>

      <title>Sideband Spectroscopy in the Strong Driving Regime: Volcano Transparency and Sideband Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of a spin to two crossed magnetic fields: a strong and fast transverse field, and a weak and slow longitudinal field. We characterize the sideband response at the sum and the difference of driving frequencies over a broad range of parameters. In the strong transverse driving regime, the emission spectrum has a characteristic volcano lineshape with a narrow central transparency region surrounded by asymmetric peaks. Next, we couple the spin to a nonlinear cavity that both drives and measures it. In a sufficiently slow longitudinal field, the emission spectrum exhibits anomalous behavior, where the resonances in both the right and left sidebands lie on the same side of the central resonance. The theoretical results are compared to the experimental measurement of the emission of substitutional nitrogen P1 and nitrogen-vacancy NV$^-$ defects in diamond.</description>

      <title>Versatile photonic frequency synthetic dimensions using a single Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-assisted device on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</description>

      <title>Enhanced PINNs for data-driven solitons and parameter discovery for (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven solutions and parameter discovery to (2+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with variable coefficients (VC-CNLSEs), which describe transverse effects in optical fiber systems under perturbed dispersion and nonlinearity. By setting different forms of perturbation coefficients, we aim to recover the dark and anti-dark one- and two-soliton structures by employing an enhanced physics-based deep neural network algorithm, namely a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The enhanced PINN algorithm leverages the locally adaptive activation function mechanism to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In the lack of data acquisition, the PINN algorithms will enhance the capability of the neural networks by incorporating physical information into the training phase. We demonstrate that applying PINN algorithms to (2+1)-dimensional VC-CNLSEs requires distinct distributions of physical information. To address this, we propose a region-specific weighted loss function with the help of residual-based adaptive refinement strategy. In the meantime, we perform data-driven parameter discovery for the model equation, classified into two categories: constant coefficient discovery and variable coefficient discovery. For the former, we aim to predict the cross-phase modulation constant coefficient under varying noise intensities using enhanced PINN with a single neural network. For the latter, we employ a dual-network strategy to predict the dynamic behavior of the dispersion and nonlinearity perturbation functions. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework holds significant potential for studying high-dimensional and complex solitonic dynamics in optical fiber systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electron Temperature Dynamics in Spintronic Terahertz Emitters Studied by Optical-Pump Terahertz-Probe Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) pumped by femtosecond lasers have become a widely used source of broadband terahertz radiation. However, the strength of the emitted field is limited in part by the optical damage threshold at the pump wavelength. Thermal management of STEs can be improved by understanding electron temperature relaxation in the spintronic metal layer. Here, we present a measurement of electron temperature dynamics on a picosecond timescale using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical pump induces a change in terahertz transmission through the STE. By analyzing the resulting signal with a two-temperature model, we extract the dynamic electron temperature of the STE. This approach offers an advantage over other methods by avoiding additional heating of the sample by the probe pulse, making it particularly suitable for studying cumulative heating effects, which are believed to contribute to optical damage under MHz repetition rate pumping.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>

      <title>Mueller Matrix Polarimetry of Fiber Bragg Grating Strain and Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a polarimetric dual-comb spectroscopy technique for simultaneous strain and torsion sensing using a single-cavity mode-locked fiber laser and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Dual-comb generation in a single-cavity fiber laser was achieved by utilizing a piece of high-birefringence fiber and adjusting the in-cavity polarization controller. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was applied to the time-domain Stokes parameters, enabling the detection of FBG spectral shifts induced by strain and torsion. To further enhance discrimination between strain and torsion, we applied a novel approach to extract Mueller matrix elements without using complex adjustable polarization components. We explored the analysis of polarimetric purity of the FBG's Mueller matrix in terms of polarizance, diattenuation, and structural polarization response as a function of FBG strain and torsion. The obtained results enabled the measurement of strain and torsion based on a single FBG, which paves the way for the development of cost-effective shape sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Onsager Reciprocal Relations for Charge and Spin Transport in Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>
