      <title>Towards a Non-singular Paradigm of Black Hole Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of regular black holes and black hole mimickers as alternatives to standard black holes has recently gained significant attention, driven both by the need to extend general relativity to describe black hole interiors, and by recent advances in observational technologies. Despite considerable progress in this field, significant challenges remain in identifying and characterizing physically well-motivated classes of regular black holes and black hole mimickers. This report provides an overview of these challenges, and outlines some of the promising research directions -- as discussed during a week-long focus programme held at the Institute for Fundamental Physics of the Universe (IFPU) in Trieste from November 11th to 15th, 2024.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in near-extremal charged black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the semiclassical current and stress-energy fluxes both at the event and Cauchy horizon of a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We consider a minimally-coupled, massless, charged scalar field in the Unruh state, describing an evaporating black hole. The near-extremal domain allows for an analytical treatment of the scattering problem of the Boulware modes both in the interior and exterior regions. We present this and explicit analytical expressions for $\langle j_v\rangle $, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle$ at the horizons, as well as estimates for $\langle j_u\rangle$ and $\langle T_{uu}\rangle $. We cross-check the analytical results numerically by bringing the radial Klein-Gordon equation into the form of the confluent Heun equation. Inserting these expectation values as sources to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, we find that at least in the near-extremal regime of small field charge, quantum effects drive the black hole interior away from extremality. Our work generalizes the known results for the real scalar field [Phys. Rev. D 104, 024066] and is in agreement with recent work on charged fields in expanding Reissner-Nordstr\"om deSitter universes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 231301, Phys. Rev. D 104, 025009].</description>

      <title>A Bright Future? Prospects for Cosmological Tests of GR with Multimessenger Gravitational Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Further bright sirens - gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts - are keenly awaited, but proving elusive. The exceptional event GW170817 had a profound impact on the landscape of viable cosmological extensions of General Relativity (GR); can we expect this kind of shift to be repeated in the next decade? In this work we will assess the potential constraints from bright sirens in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 era and third generation detector era. We set up the statistical formalism for our constraints, and generate and analyse simulated data in the context of general scalar-tensor theories. We highlight the important role that gamma-ray burst detection has in breaking key parameter degeneracies. We find that the next ten bright sirens alone will not competitively constrain cosmological gravity, but that one year of third generation observations could confidently detect mild departures from GR, e.g. the Horndeski parameter $\alpha_{\rm M}\neq 0$ is detected at greater than $3\sigma$. This justifies investment in a broad range of methods for gravitational wave cosmology (dark sirens, bright sirens and cross-correlation with large-scale structure) to ensure tests of cosmological gravity advance in both the short-term and the long-term.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. To this end, we discuss the proper decomposition into wall and bulk contributions, and we use a systematic method to calculate the energy-momentum tensor at any order in the wall width. We consider the specific examples of spherical bubbles with different initial configurations, and we compare our approximations with a numerical computation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented, extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves, as well as the Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse ``Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics'' lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program ``Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields'' at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

      <title>The Role of Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and their Tensor Structure in Quantum Gravity}}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will argue in this paper that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_{\infty}$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra $\cB(\cH_I)$ and an (internal) type $II_1$ algebra, encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom, do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Pushing limits: Probing new gravity using a satellite constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon earlier work, we explore the limits of using a configuration of satellites to measure the trace of the gravitational gradient tensor using intersatellite laser ranging and timing observables without relying on high-precision external observables such as deep space radio navigation or astrometry with unrealistic accuracy. A refined model, calculated with extended numerical precision, confirms that exceptional sensitivity is possible, placing within reach observational tests of certain modified gravity theories (e.g., Yukawa terms, galileons) using heliocentric orbits in the vicinity of the Earth. The sensitivity of the experiment improves at larger heliocentric distances. A constellation placed at 30 astronomical units, still well within the domain of feasibility using available propulsion and deep space communication technologies, may approach sensitivities that are sufficient to detect not just the gravitational contribution of the interplanetary medium but perhaps even cosmological dark matter and dark energy constituents.</description>

      <title>The Massive Flat Space Limit of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they can be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due to their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that momentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific singularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after analytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that the amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated flat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are effectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS) limit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman graph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light external legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this limit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero in inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We present a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in terms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the deep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and the properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy fields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions from heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed regime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover, which are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be reproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field inflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially non-local operators into the EFT.</description>

      <title>The Extended Uncertainty Principle from an Operational Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the traditional inequalities of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from the perspective of operational quantum mechanics. Instead of relying on purely wavefunction-based measures (e.g. the standard deviation $\sigma_x$), we introduce a apparatus-centred definition of positional uncertainty, such as a finite slit width $\Delta x$ or a spherical region of radius $R$. This choice anchors the theory directly in realistic measurement protocols and avoids ambiguities arising from wavefunction tails or boundary conditions. Using hermitian EUP momentum operators, we establish a rigorous new lower bound on the uncertainty product $\sigma_p \Delta x$. In particular, our first theorem shows that $\sigma_p \Delta x \ge \pi \hbar\,\Phi_\alpha(\Delta x/2)$, where $\Phi_\alpha(\cdot)$ encodes EUP corrections via the real parameter $\alpha \ge 0$. In the limit $\alpha \to 0$ one recovers the canonical momentum operator and the ordinary quantum mechanical inequality $\sigma_p \Delta x \ge \pi \hbar$. Extending these ideas to three (and $d$) dimensions, we also derive an analogous lower bound for systems confined in higher-dimensional spherical regions of radius $R$.</description>

      <title>Black hole-disc coevolution in the presence of magnetic fields: refining the Thorne limit with emission from within the plunging region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe emerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates revolve around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in establishing the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This speculative argument proposes that within a physical, ponderable model of space-time, anti-gravity may naturally arise. The central concept involves a paradigm shift from 'adding stuff' to `thinning out', wherein the local geometry of space-time, as perceived by embedded observers, plays a crucial role. In this context, the equivalence principle holds, emphasizing the focus on the intrinsic structure of space-time rather than interactions among individual particles or quanta.</description>

      <title>The Tolman VII Space-time in the Presence of a Charge and a Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tolman VII space-time is one of the few physically acceptable exact solutions in general relativity. In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of interior Nariai solutions. Matching with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the total charge, central density, and the cosmological constant. We investigate the physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. We show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with, $\Gamma \sim 2.5$. Finally, we analyse the sound speed and energy conditions to conclude that only a subclass of the solution follows all the basic physical acceptability criteria.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Gravitational Attractions at small Accelerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational interactions were studied by measuring the influence of small external field masses on a microwave resonator. It consisted of two spherical mirrors, which acted as independent pendulumsindividually suspended by strings. Two identical field masses weremoved along the axis of the resonator symmetrically and periodically betweena near and a far position. Their gravitational interaction altered the distance between the mirrors, changing the resonance frequency, which was measured and found consistent with Newton's law of gravity.
  The acceleration of a single mirror caused by the two field masses at the closest position varied from $5.4 \cdot 10^{-12} m/s^2$ to $259 \cdot 10^{-12}\ m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric space-time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space-time. Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon representing a deformed black hole. The space-time description in the Bondi-like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the analytical properties of the horizon geometry.</description>

      <title>Bound Orbits and Gravitational Wave Radiation Around the Hairy Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hairy black hole model provides a new theoretical framework for exploring phenomena in strong gravitational fields. This paper systematically investigates the influence of the hair parameter $\beta$ on the timelike geodesics of the regular hairy black hole, including the radius of the event horizon, the properties of bound orbits, and the characteristics of gravitational wave radiation over a single period. The study reveals that $\beta$ has a significant impact on the event horizon but only a minor effect on the innermost stable circular orbit(ISCO), the marginally bound orbit(MBO), and periodic orbits. Moreover, the trajectories of the periodic orbits are nearly identical to those of the Schwarzschild black hole. In addition, the parameter $\beta$ was constrained by simulating the precession observational data of the S2 star orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The results indicate that the correction effects of $\beta$ comply with existing observational constraints, without providing stricter limitations. Furthermore, by considering periodic orbits as transitional orbits in the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, it is found that the presence of $\beta$ introduces subtle effects on the amplitude, phase, and period of the gravitational wave signal for a single orbit. Although these effects appear minor within a single cycle, they may accumulate into significant effects over long-term evolution. In the future, space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to further investigate the properties of the hair parameter, enhancing our understanding of the spacetime structure and dynamical behavior of black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational deflection of light in polar-axis plane of a moving Kerr-Newman black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational deflection of light signals restricted in the polar-axis plane of a moving Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole with a constant velocity along the polar axis is studied within the second post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation. For this purpose, the Lorentz boosting technique is adopted to obtain the exact metric of a moving KN black hole with an arbitrary constant velocity in Kerr-Schild coordinates for the first time. Based on the weak field limit of the exact metric, we then derive the equations of motion of test particles constrained in the polar-axis plane of a moving KN source whose velocity is along the polar axis and collinear with its angular momentum. An iterative technique is utilized subsequently in the calculations of the null deflection angle up to the 2PM order caused by the moving lens, and this deflection angle is found to be spin-independent. Finally, we discuss the influence of the motion of the lens on the gravitational deflection and estimate the possibility to detect this kinematical effect. Our work might be helpful for future astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of gravitational waves microlensed by spherically symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, extracting the parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate modeling of the lensing amplification factor, accounting for wave-optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models. While numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the time and computational resources required to evaluate the amplification factor numerically make large-scale parameter estimation of the lens (and source) parameters prohibitive. On the other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven to be a powerful tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at arbitrary points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of available waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we demonstrate that surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied to the evaluation of the time-domain microlensing amplification factor $\widetilde{F}(t)$, for arbitrary lens configurations. We show this by constructing $\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models, viz. point-mass lens, and singular isothermal sphere, which notably includes logarithmic divergence behaviour. We find both surrogates reproduce the original lens models accurately, with mismatches $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$ across a range of plausible microlensed binary black hole sources observed by the Einstein Telescope. This surrogate is between 5 and $10^3$ times faster than the underlying lensing models, and can be evaluated in about 100 ms. The accuracy and efficiency attained by our surrogate models will enable practical parameter estimation analyses of microlensed GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is postulated and included by prescription. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>What is "quantum" about quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Unruh effect within a general framework based on direct, probability-level calculations. We rederive the transition rate of a uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt monopole detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial (Minkowski) observer and an accelerating (Rindler) observer. We show that, for a measurement at a finite time after the initial state is prepared, the two perspectives give the same transition rate. We confirm that an inertial detector in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles responds differently to the accelerated detector (which perceives a thermal bath of Rindler particles), except in the case of a massless field where there is agreement at all times. Finally, new numerical results for the transition rate are presented and explained, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting reality itself. TWhat emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>
