      <title>Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority II: Single-reference treatment of strong correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated systems are well described as a configuration interaction of Slater determinants classified by their number of unpaired electrons. This treatment is however unfeasible. In this manuscript, it is demonstrated that single reference methods built from Richardson-Gaudin states yield comparable results at polynomial cost.</description>

      <title>QMCTorch: Molecular Wavefunctions with Neural Components for Energy and Force Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present results obtained using QMCTorch, a modular framework for real-space Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of small molecular systems. Built on the popular deep learning library PyTorch, QMCTorch is GPU-native and enables the integration of machine learning-inspired components into the wave function ansatz, such as neural network backflow transformations and Jastrow factors, while leveraging efficient optimization algorithms. QMCTorch interfaces with two widely used quantum chemistry packages - PySCF and ADF - which provide initial values for the atomic orbital exponents and molecular orbital coefficients. In this study, we present wavefunction optimizations for four molecules: $H_2$, $LiH$, $Li_2$, and $CO$, using various wavefunction ans\"atze. We also compute their dissociation energy curves and the corresponding interatomic forces along these curves. Our results show good agreement with baseline calculations, recovering a significant portion of the correlation energy. QMCTorch provides a modular and extendable platform for rapidly prototyping new wavefunction ans\"atze, evaluating their performance, and analyzing optimization outcomes.</description>

      <title>Heavier chalcogenofenchones for fundamental gas-phase studies of molecular chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoterpene ketones are frequently studied compounds that enjoy great popularity both in chemistry and in physics due to comparatively high volatility, stability, conformational rigidity and commercial availability. Herein, we explore the heavier chalcogenoketone derivatives of fenchone as promising benchmark systems -- synthetically accessible in enantiomerically pure form -- for systematic studies of nuclear charge ($Z$) dependent properties in chiral compounds. Synthesis, structural characterization, thorough gas-phase rotational and vibrational spectroscopy as well as accompanying quantum chemical studies on the density-functional-theory level reported in this work foreshadow subsequent applications of this compound class for fundamental investigations of molecular chirality under well-defined conditions.</description>

      <title>Correlative angstrom-scale microscopy and spectroscopy of graphite-water interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water at solid surfaces is key for many processes ranging from biological signal transduction to membrane separation and renewable energy conversion. However, under realistic conditions, which often include environmental and surface charge variations, the interfacial water structure remains elusive. Here we overcome this limit by combining three-dimensional atomic force microscopy and interface-sensitive Raman spectroscopy to characterize the graphite-water interfacial structure in situ. Through correlative analysis of the spatial liquid density maps and vibrational peaks within ~2 nm of the graphite surface, we find the existence of two interfacial configurations at open circuit potential, a transient state where pristine water exhibits strong hydrogen bond (HB) breaking effects, and a steady state with hydrocarbons dominating the interface and weak HB breaking in the surrounding water. At sufficiently negative potentials, both states transition into a stable structure featuring pristine water with a broader distribution of HB configurations. Our three-state model resolves many long-standing controversies on interfacial water structure.</description>

      <title>Aluminum oxide coatings on Co-rich cathodes and interactions with organic electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become essential in modern energy storage; however, their performance is often limited by the stability and efficiency of their components, particularly the cathode and electrolyte. Transition metal layered oxide cathodes, a popular choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), suffer from several degradation mechanisms, including capacity fading, reactions with the electrolyte, unstable cathode-electrolyte interfaces, and lattice breakdown during cycling. In recent years, oxide coating, such as alumina, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the durability of cathodes by forming a protective layer that mitigates detrimental reactions and improves the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the chemical and mechanical behavior of LiCoO2 cathodes with and without aluminum oxide coatings in contact with an organic electrolyte. We examine the interactions between electrolyte molecules with both bare and coated cathode surfaces, focusing on the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the formation of oxygen species, and solvation dynamics, and evaluate the mechanical robustness of the cathode-coating interface using calculations of axial strain and cleavage energy. Our findings reveal that alumina coatings effectively reduce electrolyte degradation and stabilize the cathode structure, particularly under high-charge states. The coating's thickness and structural orientation are crucial in enhancing mechanical strength and minimizing detrimental reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interface. These insights contribute to the development of more durable LIBs by optimizing the interface chemistry and mechanical properties, providing a pathway toward higher energy densities and longer cycle life.</description>

      <title>Comparing classical and machine learning force fields for modeling deformation of solid sorbents relevant for direct air capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) with solid sorbents such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a promising approach for negative carbon emissions. Computational materials screening can help identify promising materials from the vast chemical space of potential sorbents. Experiments have shown that MOF framework flexibility and deformation induced by adsorbate molecules can drastically affect adsorption properties such as capacity and selectivity. Force field (FF) models are commonly used as surrogates for more accurate density functional theory (DFT) calculations when modeling sorbents, but most studies using FFs for MOFs assume framework rigidity to simplify calculations. Although flexible FFs for MOFs have been parameterized for specific materials, the generality of FFs for reliably modeling adsorbate-induced deformation to near-DFT accuracy has not been established. This work benchmarks the efficacy of several general FFs in describing adsorbate-induced deformation for DAC against DFT. Specifically, we compare a common classical FF (UFF4MOF) with several machine learning (ML) FFs: M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, MACE-MPA-0, eSEN, and the Equiformer V2 model developed from the recent Open DAC 2023 dataset. Our results show that current classical methods are insufficient for describing framework deformation, especially in cases of interest for DAC where strong interactions exist between adsorbed molecules and MOF frameworks. The emerging ML methods we tested -- particularly CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and Equiformer V2 -- appear to be more promising than the classical FF for emulating the deformation behavior described by DFT but fail to achieve the accuracy required for practical predictions.</description>

      <title>Single Cu Atom Sites on Co3O4 Activate Interfacial Oxygen for Enhanced Reactivity and Selective Gas Sensing at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the redox landscape of transition metal oxides is central to advancing their reactivity for heterogeneous catalysis or high-performance gas sensing. Here we report single Cu atom sites (1.42 wt%) anchored on Co3O4 nanoparticles (Cu1-Co3O4) that dramatically enhance reactivity and molecular sensing properties of the support at low temperature. The Cu1 are identified by X-ray adsorption near edge structure and feature strong metal-support interaction between Cu2+ and Co3O4, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ability of Cu1 to form interfacial Cu-O-Co linkages strongly reduces the temperature of lattice oxygen activation compared to CuO nanoparticles on Co3O4 (CuONP-Co3O4), as demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analyses. To demonstrate immediate practical impact, we deploy such Cu1-Co3O4 nanoparticles as chemoresistive sensor for formaldehyde vapor that yields more than an order of magnitude higher response than CuONP-Co3O4 and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sensors. That way, formaldehyde is detected down to 5 parts-per-billion at 50% relative humidity and 75 {\deg}C with excellent selectivity over various critical interferents. These results establish a mechanistic platform for activating redox-active supports using single-atom isolates of non-noble nature that yield drastically enhanced and well-defined reactivity to promote low-temperature oxidation reactions and selective analyte sensing.</description>

      <title>Refining ensemble $N$-representability of one-body density matrices from partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $N$-representability problem places fundamental constraints on reduced density matrices (RDMs) that originate from physical many-fermion quantum states. Motivated by recent developments in functional theories, we introduce a hierarchy of ensemble one-body $N$-representability problems that incorporate partial knowledge of the one-body reduced density matrices (1RDMs) within an ensemble of $N$-fermion states with fixed weights $w_i$. Specifically, we propose a systematic relaxation that reduces the refined problem -- where full 1RDMs are fixed for certain ensemble elements -- to a more tractable form involving only natural occupation number vectors. Remarkably, we show that this relaxed problem is related to a generalization of Horn's problem, enabling an explicit solution by combining its constraints with those of the weighted ensemble $N$-representability conditions. An additional convex relaxation yields a convex polytope that provides physically meaningful restrictions on lattice site occupations in ensemble density functional theory for excited states.</description>

      <title>Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining eigenvalues is a computationally expensive task that is crucial for countless applications in natural sciences. Toward this end, we introduce the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues. Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence criteria.</description>

      <title>Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Framework for Predicting Arsenic Adsorption on Graphene Oxide Surfaces -- A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water contamination by arsenic(V) constitutes a major public-health concern, underscoring the need for models that capture both equilibrium and transient adsorption behaviour. A framework that can do so is the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework, which is used here to describe the uptake of As(V) on graphene oxide (GO) across pollutant concentrations of 25-350 mg/L. A non-equilibrium equation of motion derived from the steepest-entropy-ascent principle for a five-component system (water, arsenic, two GO functional groups, and protons is solved with an energy eigenstructure generated by a Replica-Exchange Wang-Landau algorithm and then extrapolated to relevant contaminant concentrations via an artificial neural network. Without recourse to empirical rate laws, the model predicts the time-dependent adsorption capacity, the stable-equilibrium arsenic concentration, and the pH dependence of removal efficiency. Equilibrium capacities are reproduced within 5 % of experimental isotherms, and the characteristic adsorption time aligns with the reported kinetics. These results indicate that SEAQT framework provides a thermodynamically consistent, fully predictive tool for designing and optimising adsorbent-based water-treatment technologies.</description>

      <title>Critical Limitations in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Quantum Chemistry for Accurate Negative Singlet-Triplet Gap Predictions: A Case for Double-Hybrid DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules that have been suggested to violate the Hund's rule, having a first excited singlet state (S$_1$) energetically below the triplet state (T$_1$), are rare. Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ($&gt;100$ meV) despite very low standard deviations ($\approx10$ meV). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.</description>

      <title>Fully numerical Hartree-Fock calculations for atoms and small molecules with quantics tensor trains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully numerical framework for the optimization of molecule-specific quantum chemical basis functions within the quantics tensor train format using a finite-difference scheme. The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.</description>

      <title>Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials for Efficient and Accurate Bioorganic Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20955v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum mechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from limited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here, we present Egret-1, a family of large pretrained NNPs based on the MACE architecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and biomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the accuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of standard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry optimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to legacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to investigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models with increased scale and generality.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Real-Time Thermal Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid Path Integral Monte Carlo (hPIMC) algorithm to calculate real-time quantum thermal correlation functions and demonstrate its application to open quantum systems. The hPIMC algorithm leverages the successes of classical PIMC as a computational tool for high-dimensional system studies by exactly simulating dissipation using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional on a classical computer. We achieve a quantum speed-up over the classical algorithm by computing short-time matrix elements of the quantum propagator on a quantum computer. We show that the component of imaginary-time evolution can be performed accurately using the recently developed Probabilistic Imaginary-Time Evolution (PITE) algorithm, and we introduce a novel low-depth circuit for approximate real-time evolution under the kinetic energy operator using a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). We test the accuracy of the approximation by computing the position-position thermal correlation function of a proton transfer reaction.</description>
