      <title>Real-space topological invariant for time-quasiperiodic Majoranas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When subjected to quasiperiodic driving protocols, superconducting systems have been found to harbor robust time-quasiperiodic Majorana modes, extending the concept beyond static and Floquet systems. However, the presence of incommensurate driving frequencies results in dense energy spectra, rendering conventional methods of defining topological invariants based on band structure inadequate. In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this invariant in the presence of dense spectra. Our numerical simulations, focusing on a Kitaev chain driven by two incommensurate frequencies, validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Sub-Sharvin conductance and incoherent shot-noise in graphene disks at magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-doped graphene samples show the conductance reduced and the shot-noise power enhanced compared to standard ballistic systems in two-dimensional electron gas. These features can be understood within a model assuming incoherent scattering of Dirac electrons between two interfaces separating the sample and the leads. Here we find, by adopting the above-mentioned model for the edge-free (Corbino) geometry and by means of the computer simulation of quantum transport, that another graphene-specific feature should be observable when the current flow through a doped disk is blocked by high magnetic field. In case the conductance drops to zero, the Fano factor approaches the value of $F\approx{}0.56$, with a very weak dependence on the disk radii ratio. The role of finite source-drain voltages and the system behavior upon tuning the electrostatic potential barrier from a rectangular to parabolic shape are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical ancilla qubits generator for error correction algorithms in quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup that generates properly entangled ancillary ("ancilla") qubits for error correction algorithms in quantum computing, demonstrated as an encoder for the three-qubit bit flip code. The setup is based on mesoscopic terminal utilizing the AC Josephson effect between voltage biased superconducting electrodes and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic superconducting grain in the regime of the Cooper pair box, controlled by the gate voltage. Required functionality is achieved by specifically tailored time-protocol of operating two external parameters: bias voltage and gate voltage. The superconducting grain is fixed on the free end of a cantilever, performing controlled in-plane mechanical vibrations, generating the nanomechanical coherent states organised in a pair of entangled cat-states in two perpendicular spatial directions. Cooper pair box and nanomechanical coherent states become three entangled qubits in a particular way: quantum information, initially encoded in superposition of the Cooper pair box states, is transduced into quantum superposition of two special 3-qubit entangled states, $\vert \uparrow + \, + \rangle$ and $\vert \downarrow - \, - \rangle$. It constitutes the basic input state for the three-qubit bit flip code, used in quantum computation mainly for error correction, "installed" on a single physical object in which the last two ancilla qubits are generated by the nanoelectromechanical setup.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder on Berry curvature and quantum metric in two-band gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric properties of parameter space are mostly described by Berry curvature and quantum metric, which is the imaginary and real part of quantum geometric tensor, respectively. In this work, we calculate the dressed Berry curvature and quantum metric containing eight Feynman diagrams, which is proportional to the leading-order of the concentration of impurities. For a two-band gapped graphene model, we find the disorder does not break the original symmetry of Berry curvature and quantum metric but decrease (increase) the absolute value of conductor (valence) band. We show how impurities affect the Berry curvature and quantum metric, laying the foundation for the study of the influence of impurities on the electron transport properties.</description>

      <title>Chern Number Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Compensated Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to realize quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We consider antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a concrete example. In contrast to the even-layer A-type antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ that has zero Chern number due to the combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, the system can host a nonzero Chern number by breaking this symmetry. We show that by controlling the antiferromagnetic spin configuration, for example, down/up/up/down, to break $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, tetralayer antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ can realize QAHE with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. Such spin configuration can be stablized by pinning the spin orientations on top and bottom layers. Furthermore, we reveal that the edge states are layer-selective and primarily locate at the boundaries of the bottom and top layers. In addition, via tuning the on-site orbital energy which determines the inverted band gap, we find tunable Chern number from $\mathcal{C}=-1$ to $\mathcal{C}=2$ and then to $\mathcal{C}=-1$. Our work not only proposes a scheme to realize Chern number tunable QAHE in antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization, but also provide a platform for layer-selective dissipationless transport devices.</description>

      <title>Spin waves in antiferromagnetically coupled bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides with Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze spin waves in bilayers of two-dimensional van der Waals materials, like Vanadium based dichalcogenides, VX$_2$ (X=S, Se, Te) and other materials of similar symmetry. We assume that the materials exhibit Dzialoshinskii- Moriya interaction and in-plane easy-axis magnetic anisotropy due to symmetry breaking induced externally (eg, by strain, gate voltage, proximity effects to an appropriate substrate/oberlayer, etc). The considerations are limited to a collinear spin ground state, stabilized by a sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The theoretical analysis is performed within the general spin wave theory based on the Hollstein-Primakoff-Bogolubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Valley focusing effect in a rippled graphene superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene corrugations affect hybridization of $\pi$ and $\sigma$ orbitals of carbon atoms in graphene based systems. It can as well break differently the symmetry of the electron transfer integrals for different strip boundaries. Using these facts, we found that the momentum distribution of electrons in ballistically propagating beam can be selective without external electric and/or magnetic fields in the graphene strip under experimentally feasible periodic potential. Such a potential is created by means of the superlattice that consists of periodically repeated graphene elements (flat+rippled junction) with different hybridization of carbon orbits, produced by variation of the graphene surface curvature. As a result it gives rise to the valley dependent focusing effects that can be controlled by alteration of number of superlattice elements.</description>

      <title>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization by cooperation of planar Hall and orbital Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect are promising for manipulating magnetization. However, this approach typically exhibits non-deterministic and inefficient behaviour when it comes to switching perpendicular ferromagnets. This limitation posed a challenge for write-in operations in high-density magnetic memory devices. Here, we determine an effective solution to overcome this challenge by simultaneously leveraging both a planar Hall effect (PHE) and an orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd/Mo trilayer SOT device, we demonstrate that the PHE of Co is enhanced by the interfacial coupling of Co/PtGd, giving rise to a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque within the Co layer. Simultaneously, the OHE in Mo layer induces a strong out-of-plane orbital current, significantly amplifying the in-plane damping-like torque through orbital-to-spin conversion. While either the PHE or OHE alone proves insufficient for reversing the perpendicular magnetization of Co, their collaborative action enables high-efficiency field-free deterministic switching. Our work provides a straightforward strategy to realize high-speed and low-power spintronics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin torque in the topological phase of the 3Q antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration. We first obtain the band structure to identify the topology and nature of the different gaps of the system and then calculate the spin density in the whole system. We demonstrate the presence of a non-vanishing spin-torque component at the edge of the system and analyze its effect on the texture. Moreover, we show that the direction of the torque depends hugely on the way we cut the system to define the edge.</description>

Abstract: We consider the anomalous, spin, valley, and valley spin Hall effects in a pristine ex-so-tic graphene-based van-der-Waals (vdW) heterostructure consisting of a bilayer graphene (BLG) between semiconducting van-der-Waals material with strong SOC (e.g., WS$_2$) and ferromagnetic and insulating vdW material (e.g. Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$). Reducing the effective Hamiltonian derived by Zollner et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125(19), 196402 (2020)] to low-energy states, and using the Green function formalism, we derived analytical results for the Hall conductivities as a function of the Fermi level and gate voltage. Depending on these parameters, we found quantized valley conductivity.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in AA homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor by a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

      <title>Switchable quantized signal between longitudinal conductance and Hall conductance in dual quantum spin Hall insulator TaIrTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulating states in two-dimensional (2D) materials are ideal systems to study different types of quantized response signals due to their in gap metallic states. Very recently, the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect was discovered in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$ via the observation of quantized longitudinal conductance that rarely exists in other 2D topological insulators. The non-trivial $Z_2$ topological charges can exist at both charge neutrality point and the van Hove singularity point with correlation effect induced band gap. Based on this model 2D material, we studied the switch of quantized signals between longitudinal conductance and transversal Hall conductance via tuning external magnetic field. In $Z_2$ topological phase of monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$, the zero Chern number can be understood as 1-1=0 from the double band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels. After applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, the Zeeman split changes the band order for one branch of the band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels, along with a sign charge of the Berry phase. Then the net Chern number of 1-1=0 is tuned to 1+1=2 or -1-1=-2 depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. The quantized signal not only provides another effective method for the verification of topological state in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$, but also offers a strategy for the utilization of the new quantum topological states based on switchable quantized responses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of strong relativistic spin-orbit effects in low-dimensional systems provides a rich opportunity for exploring unconventional states of matter. Here, we present a route to realize highly tunable relativistic band structures based on the lateral patterning of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The concept is illustrated on a 1D patterned graphene heterostructure, where the periodic spatial modulation of SOC is shown to give rise to a rich mini-band structure with massless and massive Dirac bands carrying large Berry curvature. The envisaged systems support robust spin Hall responses driven by the quantum geometry of mini-bands, which can be tailored through metasurface fabrication methods and twisting effects. These findings suggest new pathways to 2D quantum material design and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonance arises from interference between a direct path and a resonant path. Predictions and observations of Fano profiles of conductance have been reported yet only in nonchiral electron transport. We propose an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer(\textcolor{blue}{MZFI}) that integrates a quantum dot to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer and investigate various transport spectra of this type of device. Electron motion in the device is chiral and backscattering is absent, enabling the transmission, linear conductance and differential spectra such as differential conductance, differential shot noise and differential Fano factor to possess perfect Fano profiles that can be fully tuned by an external magnetic flux. For a symmetric interferometer of(two arms with the same length, even the current and shot noise demonstrate fully tunable resonances and are bestowed different hallmarks unique to Fano resonances. All the transport spectra display the same evolution pattern in an evolution cycle, which along with the profiles are robust against variation of the parameters defining the device.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional borophene: In-plane hyperbolic polaritons in the visible spectral range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Dissipation Nanomechanical Devices from Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their low mass and long coherence times, nanomechanical resonators have many applications, from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. In many instances the performance is limited by internal material damping. Crystalline materials promise lower material dissipation, however due to fabrication challenges, amorphous materials are more commonly utilized. Crystalline silicon carbide (SiC) is particularly appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but to-date exhibits higher nanomechanical dissipation than both amorphous and other crystalline materials. To address this, we fabricate nanomechanical resonators thinned from bulk monocrystalline 4H-SiC. Characterization of multiple resonators of different sizes and thicknesses, allows us to discern the surface and volumetric contributions to dissipation. We measure mechanical dissipation rates as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline SiC resonator, yielding quality factors as high as 20 million at room temperature. We also quantify the nonlinear dissipation of SiC nanomechanical resonators for the first time, finding that it is lower than other materials. This promises higher sensitivity in applications such as mass sensing. By achieving exceptionally low dissipation in SiC resonators, our work provides a path towards improved performance in sensing and other applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral edge plasmons in quantum anomalous Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the Berry curvature splits the edge plasmons propagating along the opposite directions in quantum anomalous Hall insulators even with vanishing Chern number. When the bulk is insulating, only one unidirectional edge plasmon mode survives whose direction can be changed by external fields. The unidirectional edge plasmon in the long-wavelength limit is acoustic and essentially determined by the anomalous Hall conductivity. The group velocity of the chiral edge plasmon would change its sign for a large wave vector, which originates from the k-quadratic correction to the effective mass. The impacts of the Fermi level and the wave vector on the bulk and edge plasmons are discussed. Our work provides a well quantitative explanation of the recent observation of the chiral edge plasmon in quantum anomalous Hall insulators and some insight into the application of realistic topological materials in chiral plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Low-energy modeling of three-dimensional topological insulator nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an accurate nanoelectronic modeling approach for realistic three-dimensional topological insulator nanostructures and investigate their low-energy surface-state spectrum. Starting from the commonly considered four-band $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{k\cdot p}}$ bulk model Hamiltonian for the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family of topological insulators, we derive new parameter sets for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We consider a fitting strategy applied to \emph{ab initio} band structures around the $\Gamma$ point that ensures a quantitatively accurate description of the low-energy bulk and surface states, while avoiding the appearance of unphysical low-energy states at higher momenta, something that is not guaranteed by the commonly considered perturbative approach. We analyze the effects that arise in the low-energy spectrum of topological surface states due to band anisotropy and electron-hole asymmetry, yielding Dirac surface states that naturally localize on different side facets. In the thin-film limit, when surface states hybridize through the bulk, we resort to a thin-film model and derive thickness-dependent model parameters from \emph{ab initio} calculations that show good agreement with experimentally resolved band structures, unlike the bulk model that neglects relevant many-body effects in this regime. Our versatile modeling approach offers a reliable starting point for accurate simulations of realistic topological material-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dispersion via dissipative coupling in a quantum well exciton-polariton microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the principles of quantum mechanics the Hamiltonian describing a closed system's energies must be Hermitian. This leads to an avoided crossing on resonance, as coupling between states causes the energy levels to repel. This concept lies at the heart of exciton-polariton physics, where coherent exciton-photon interaction causes polariton branches to repel in momentum dispersion. However, non-Hermitian physics predicts an opposite effect: level attraction, which occurs when significant energy dissipation is present in the system. Here, we show a manifestation of dissipative coupling in a high-quality AlGaAs-based polariton microcavity, where two polariton branches attract, resulting in an anomalous, inverted dispersion of the lower branch in momentum dispersion. We observe the evolution of the level attraction with exciton-photon detuning, leading to changes in anomalous dispersion shape within a single sample. The dissipative coupling is explained by the interaction with an indirect exciton, acting as a highly dissipative channel in our system, and the observed dispersions are well captured within a phenomenological model. Our results present a new mechanism of dissipative coupling in light-matter systems and offer a tunable and well-controlled AlGaAs-based platform for engineering the non-Hermitian and negative mass effects in polariton systems.</description>

      <title>Magnon Landau-Zener tunnelling and spin current generation by electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To control the magnon transport in magnetic systems is of great interest in magnonics. Due to the feasibility of electric field, how to generate and manipulate magnon with pure electrical method is one of the most desired goals. Here we propose that the magnon spin current is generated by applying time-dependent electric field, where the coupling between the magnon and electric field is invoked via Aharonov-Casher effect. In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electrical spin manipulation in double SrTiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin dynamics in two electron double quantum dots embedded in two dimensional electron gas at the interface between SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ is studied by an exact numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, in the context of the electric dipole spin resonance experiment. Based on the three band model of $3d$-electrons localized at Ti ions on the square lattice we analyze in details the singlet-triplet transition induced by the AC electric field, in the magnetic field range close to the avoided crossing which appears as a result of the spin-orbit coupling. Our calculations show that for symmetric double quantum dots the single photon spin-flip transitions is prohibited due to the parity symmetry and the transition can occur only by the higher order two-photon processes. For a weakly asymmetric system, when the first order singlet-triplet transitions are released due to the parity symmetry breaking, the spin-flip transition has a character of the Rabi oscillations for a low electric field amplitude. As the amplitude is increased the frequency of the transition is blueshifted (redshifted) for the magnetic field below (above) the single-triplet avoided crossing. Interestingly, for a sufficiently high magnetic field and high AC field amplitude the electric field drives the system across the avoided crossing inducing the spin-flip by the Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana transitions with 100\% spin flip probability for a slow sweep. Finally, the optimization of the geometrical parameters of the system with respect to the time of spin-flip of its fidelity is also presented.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast low-energy photoelectron diffraction for the study of surface-adsorbate interactions with 100 femtosecond temporal resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultrafast photoemission-based low-energy electron diffraction experiment with monolayer surface sensitivity is presented. In a first experiment on tin-phthalocyanine adsorbed on graphite, we demonstrate a time resolution of approx. 100 fs. Analysis of the transient photoelectron diffraction signal indicates a heating of the adsorbate layer on a time scale of a few ps, suggesting coupling to phononic degrees of freedom of the substrate as the primary energy transfer channel for the vibrational excitation of the adsorbate layer. Remarkably, the transient photoelectron diffraction signal not only provides direct information about the structural dynamics of the adsorbate, but also about the charge carrier dynamics of the substrate. The presented concept combined with momentum microscopy could become a versatile tool for the comprehensive investigation of the coupled charge and vibrational dynamics of relevance for ultrafast surface processes.</description>

      <title>One Trillion True Random Bits Generated with a Field Programmable Gate Array Actuated Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large quantities of random numbers are crucial in a wide range of applications. We have recently demonstrated that perpendicular nanopillar magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) can produce true random bits when actuated with short pulses. However, our implementation used high-end and expensive electronics, such as a high bandwidth arbitrary waveform generator and analog-to-digital converter, and was limited to relatively low data rates. Here, we significantly increase the speed of true random number generation (TRNG) of our stochastic actuated pMTJs (SMART-pMTJs) using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), demonstrating the generation of over $10^{12}$ bits at rates exceeding 10Mb/s. The resulting bitstreams pass the NIST Statistical Test Suite for randomness with only one XOR operation. In addition to a hundred-fold reduction in the setup cost and a thousand-fold increase in bitrate, the advancement includes simplifying and optimizing random bit generation with a custom-designed analog daughter board to interface an FPGA and SMART-pMTJ. The resulting setup further enables FPGA at-speed processing of MTJ data for stochastic modeling and cryptography.</description>

      <title>Multipole magnons in topological skyrmion lattices resolved by cryogenic Brillouin light scattering microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collinear magnetic skyrmion lattices provide novel magnonic functionalities due to their topological magnon bands and asymmetric dispersion relations. Magnon excitations with intermediate wavelengths comparable to inter-skyrmion distances are particularly interesting but largely unexplored so far due to experimental challenges. Here, we report the detection of such magnons with wavevectors q $\simeq$ 48 rad/um in the metastable skyrmion lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad bandwidth we resolved various excitation modes of a single skyrmion lattice domain over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known modes with dipole character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to theoretical predictions enabled the identification of a quadrupole mode and observation of signatures which we attribute to a decupole and a sextupole mode. Our combined experimental and theoretical work highlights that skyrmionic phases allow for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon bands.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a novel method of manipulating quantum phases of matter via periodic driving [1, 2]. It has successfully been utilized in different platforms ranging from photonic systems [3] to optical lattice of ultracold atoms [4, 5]. In solids, light can be used as the periodic drive via coherent light-matter interaction. This leads to hybridization of Bloch electrons with photons resulting in replica bands known as Floquet-Bloch states. After the direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in a topological insulator [6], their manifestations have been seen in a number of other experiments [7-14]. By engineering the electronic band structure using Floquet-Bloch states, various exotic phase transitions have been predicted [15-22] to occur. To realize these phases, it is necessary to better understand the nature of Floquet-Bloch states in different materials. However, direct energy and momentum resolved observation of these states is still limited to only few material systems [6, 10, 14, 23, 24]. Here, we report direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer epitaxial graphene which was the first proposed material platform [15] for Floquet engineering. By using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with mid-infrared (mid-IR) pump excitation, we detected replicas of the Dirac cone. Pump polarization dependence of these replica bands unequivocally shows that they originate from the scattering between Floquet-Bloch states and photon-dressed free-electron-like photoemission final states, called Volkov states. Beyond graphene, our method can potentially be used to directly observe Floquet-Bloch states in other systems paving the way for Floquet engineering in a wide range of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis thoroughly investigates the production, characterization, and applications of graphene-based materials (GBMs) and amorphous magnetic materials, particularly in electromagnetic shielding and gas sensing. Four main research lines are pursued: GBM production, GBMs and amorphous magnetic materials in shielding applications, GBMs in gas sensors, and amorphous magnetic materials in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors. Scalable methods for GBM production are explored, including ball milling, yielding few-layered mesoporous graphene (FLMG). FLMG enhances electromagnetic shielding when combined with amorphous magnetic microwires (MW), showing synergistic effects. FLMG also demonstrates effective NO2 detection in gas sensors, with UV irradiation improving sensor performance. Amorphous magnetic materials show promise in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors for biomedical applications. Overall, this thesis addresses current limitations in electromagnetic shielding and gas detection, supported by patents and scientific publications.</description>

      <title>Domain wall migration-mediated ferroelectric switching and Rashba effect tuning in GeTe thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium Telluride (GeTe), identified as a ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor, is a promising candidate for future electronic devices in computing and memory applications. However, its ferroelectric switching on a microscopic scale remains to be understood. Here, we propose that the migration of a domain wall can be the mechanism that mediates the ferroelectric switching. By employing $ab~initio$ methods, such a mechanism is characterized by an energy barrier of $66.8$ meV/nm$^2$, in a suitable range for retention and switchability. In accompanying the domain wall migration, the net Rashba effect is tunable, as it is a result of competition between layers with opposite electric polarization. These results shed light on the ferroelectric switching mechanism in GeTe, paving stones for the design of potential GeTe-based devices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Photoluminescence by Strain-Engineering in Layered Perovskite Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain is an effective strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials, but it has been almost unexplored in layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) due to their complex band structure and mechanical properties. Here, we investigate the temperature-dependent microphotoluminescence (PL) of 2D $(C_6H_5CH_2CH_2NH_3)_2Cs_3Pb_4Br_{13}$ HOIP subject to biaxial strain induced by a $SiO_2$ ring platform on which flakes are placed by viscoelastic stamping. At 80 K, we found that a strain of &lt;1% can change the PL emission from a single peak (unstrained) to three well-resolved peaks. Supported by micro-Raman spectroscopy, we show that the thermomechanically generated strain modulates the bandgap due to changes in the octahedral tilting and lattice expansion. Mechanical simulations demonstrate the coexistence of tensile and compressive strain along the flake. The observed PL peaks add an interesting feature to the rich phenomenology of photoluminescence in 2D HOIPs, which can be exploited in tailored sensing and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Assessment of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Simulations in Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) method is highlighted for its relatively simple numerical algorithm and low computational cost in the simulation of microstructural evolution. In this method, probabilistic state change rules are implemented to compute the evolution of cell states at each time step. The stochastic nature of this simulation method leads to non-repeatable simulation results, introducing inherent uncertainty. In this study, the uncertainty and dispersion in PCA simulations of microstructural evolution were investigated. Hence, the probabilistic transformations of cell states were meticulously considered at each time step, and discrete probability distribution functions (dPDF) were introduced to analyze the frequency distribution of simulation outcomes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed dPDFs, cellular automaton models were developed with various numbers of cells and distribution of transformation probabilities. Multiple iterations of these simulations were conducted, and the validity of the presented distribution functions was assessed through statistical analysis of the simulations outcomes. Comparisons between PCA simulation results and distribution functions demonstrate consistency, emphasizing the predictive capability of the proposed models. Also, the effects of modeling parameters on the uncertainty of simulation results in two and three-dimensional PCA modeling were studied, introducing the coefficient of variation as a measure of dispersion. Results indicate that increasing the number of boundary cells, cellular resolution, and model size reduces uncertainty, enhancing the repeatability of PCA simulation outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the scattering theory of the Josephson effect to include a coupling of the Josephson junction to a gapless electron reservoir in the normal state. By opening up the system with a quasiparticle escape rate $1/\tau$, the supercurrent carried at zero temperature by an Andreev level at energy $\varepsilon_{\rm A}$ is reduced by a factor $(2/\pi)\arctan(2\varepsilon_{\rm A}\tau/\hbar)$ . We make contact with recent work on "non-Hermitian Josephson junctions", by comparing this result to different proposed generalizations of the Josephson effect to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation for many-body systems: Derivation based on the Lieb-Robinson bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) quantum master equation is a powerful tool for the study of open quantum many-body systems. However, its microscopic derivation applicable to many-body systems is available only in limited cases of weak internal couplings, and it has yet to be fully understood under what microscopic conditions the local GKSL equation is valid. We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced Kondo effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metals containing magnetic impurities, conduction electrons screen the magnetic impurities and induce the Kondo effect, i.e., the enhancement of the electrical resistance at low temperatures. Motivated by recent advances in manipulating quantum materials by cavity confinement, we study how the ultrastrong light-matter coupling can affect the Kondo effect. We show that the ultrastrong coupling can enhance the Kondo temperature and give rise to several notable phenomena, including universal scalings of the cavity-modified Kondo effect, the photon occupation number, and the entanglement entropy between the cavity and electrons. The origin of the cavity enhancement can be understood from the mass renormalization due to the cavity-mediated nonlocal electron-electron interaction, which is akin to the polaronic mass enhancement. We combine the unitary transformations and the Gaussian variational states to analyze the quantum impurity system confined in the cavity. Our nonperturbative framework can be applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems influenced by structured quantum electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Robust electrothermal switching of optical phase change materials through computer-aided adaptive pulse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable optical devices present diverse functionalities for manipulating electromagnetic waves by leveraging elements capable of reversibly switching between different optical states. This adaptability in adjusting their responses to electromagnetic waves after fabrication is crucial for developing more efficient and compact optical systems for a broad range of applications including sensing, imaging, telecommunications, and data storage. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown great promise due to their stable, non-volatile phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Nonetheless, optimizing the switching parameters of PCM devices and maintaining their stable operation over thousands of cycles with minimal variation can be challenging. In this paper, we report on the critical role of PCM pattern as well as electrical pulse form in achieving reliable and stable switching, extending the operational lifetime of the device beyond 13,000 switching events. To achieve this, we have developed a computer-aided algorithm that monitors optical changes in the device and adjusts the applied voltage in accordance with the phase transformation process, thereby significantly enhancing the lifetime of these reconfigurable devices. Our findings reveal that patterned PCM structures show significantly higher endurance compared to blanket PCM thin films.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical detection of spin-orbit torque vector with first-order Kerr effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel, compact and cost-effective magneto-optical method for quantifying the spin-orbit torque (SOT) effective field vector (hSO) in magnetic thin films subjected to spin current injection. The damping-like (hSODL) component of the vector is obtained by the polar Kerr response arising from the out-of-plane magnetization tilting, whereas the field-like component (hSODL) is obtained by current-induced hysteresis-loop shifting study, using conventional longitudinal Kerr magnetometry.
  We tested our method in FM/NM bilayers comprising NiFe, CoFeB (ferromagnetic layers) and Pt, Pd, Ta (non-magnetic layers). Our findings revealed a damping-like SOT efficiency xiDL of 0.089 pm 0.006,0.019 pm 0.002, and -0.132 pm 0.009 for Pt, Pd, and Ta, respectively. The hSOFL/hSODL ratio was 0.35 pm 0.02 for NiFe/Pt and 0.14 pm 0.002 for Ta/CoFeB bilayers when the ferromagnetic layer thickness is 4nm.
  A key advancement over the state-of-art magneto-optical methods is the use of an oblique light incidence angle, which allows switching between measuring modes for hSODL and hSOFL, without altering the experimental setup. Moreover, our approach relies exclusively on first-order Kerr effects, thereby ensuring its broad applicability to any type of ferromagnetic material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals with a skyrmion topological charge of 1 and 2 at a zero magnetic field. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-induced even-odd discrepancy of magnetotransport in few-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The van der Waals antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 represents a promising platform for exploring the layer-dependent magnetism and topological states of matter. Recently observed discrepancies between magnetic and transport properties have aroused controversies concerning the topological nature of MnBi2Te4 in the ground state. In this article, we demonstrate that fabrication can induce mismatched even-odd layer dependent magnetotransport in few-layer MnBi2Te4. We perform a comprehensive study of the magnetotransport properties in 6- and 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4, and reveal that both even- and odd-number-layer device can show zero Hall plateau phenomena in zero magnetic field. Importantly, a statistical survey of the optical contrast in more than 200 MnBi2Te4 flakes reveals that the zero Hall plateau in odd-number-layer devices arises from the reduction of the effective thickness during the fabrication, a factor that was rarely noticed in previous studies of 2D materials. Our finding not only provides an explanation to the controversies regarding the discrepancy of the even-odd layer dependent magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4, but also highlights the critical issues concerning the fabrication and characterization of 2D material devices.</description>

      <title>Compact Localized States in Electric Circuit Flatband Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generate compact localized states in an electrical diamond lattice, comprised of only capacitors and inductors, via local driving near its flatband frequency. We compare experimental results to numerical simulations and find very good agreement. We also examine the stub lattice, which features a flatband of a different class where neighboring compact localized states share lattice sites. We find that local driving, while exciting the lattice at that flatband frequency, is unable to isolate a single compact localized state due to their non-orthogonality. Finally, we introduce lattice nonlinearity and showcase the realization of nonlinear compact localized states in the diamond lattice. Our findings pave the way of applying flatband physics to complex electric circuit dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edge truncation under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase, quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the negative permittivity background exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge states can exist within the shrunken structure by modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be excited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges. Our results show that the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

Abstract: The inevitable Gilbert damping in magnetization dynamics is usually regarded as detrimental to spin transport. Here we apply a general feature of chiral non-Hermitian dynamics to a ferromagnetic-insulator--normal-metal heterostructure to show that the strong momentum dependence and chirality of the eddy-current-induced damping also causes beneficial scattering properties: A potential barrier that reflects magnon wave packets becomes unidirectionally transparent in the presence of a metallic cap layer. Passive magnon gates that turn presumably harmful dissipation into useful functionalities should be useful for future quantum magnonic devices.</description>

Abstract: We study transport through interfaces in topological nodal-line semimetals, focusing on two geometries: a single interface between two large samples, one nodal-line semimetal and one metal, and an infinite nodal-line semimetal slab in between two metallic regions. We investigate the dependence of the spectra on the boundary conditions, showing how they affect the surface states and the band dispersion. We find a set of drum states, arising from the hybridization of the drumhead states on opposite surfaces at finite slab width, and describe their signatures in the transport properties of a clean sample. Finally, we compute the electronic trajectories in the ballistic regime and show that there is a series of resonant angles that ensure perfect transmission. We also show how the current density profile acquires an inhomogeneous distribution in the radial direction.</description>

      <title>Energetic comparison of exciton gas versus electron-hole plasma in a bilayer two-dimensional electron-hole system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a symmetric electron-hole bilayer system by comparing the ground state energies of two distinct limiting cases, characterized by an electron-hole plasma or an exciton gas, respectively. For the electron-hole plasma, the random phase approximation is used; for the exciton gas, we consider three different approximations: the unscreened Coulomb interaction, the statically screened one, and the dynamically screened one under the plasmon-pole approximation. Our results suggest that the exciton gas is stable at small layer separation. However, static screening in general suppresses the formation of excitons, and dynamic screening gives different results depending on the representative energy scale we used in the plasmon-pole approximation. We conclude that energetic considerations alone are very sensitive to the approximation schemes, and the phase diagram of the system may depend crucially on exactly how the electron-hole attraction is treated in the theory. For very small and very large densities, however, all our approximations show the exciton gas to have lower energy than the plasma.</description>

      <title>Coherently controlling robust spin-orbit qubits of electrons in nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an electron confined in a gated nanowire quantum dot (NQD) with arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and weak static magnetic field, and treat the latter as a perturbation to seek the maximal spin-motion entangled states with the exact general solutions of the perturbed equations. From the boundedness and self-consistent conditions of the general solutions we find two corrected energies to any n level of the unperturbed system with ground state n = 0, which are much less than the unperturbed level-difference and corresponds to a spin-orbit qubit. We demonstrate the metastability of the two-level states and the decoherence-averse effect of SOC, and suggest an alternative scheme to perform the qubit control, simply by adjusting the orientation of magnetic field for any fixed SOC. Such a adjustment can lead to the spin flipping of the state vector and the position exchanging of the probability-density wavepackets which can be proposed as the non-Abelian quasiparticles. The results could be directly extended to a weakly coupled array of NQDs for coherently encoding the robust spin-orbit qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically a setup consisting of excitons formed in two valleys, with proximity-induced Cooper pairing, different in conduction and valence bands. Due to the combination of Coulomb interaction with superconducting proximity effects, Cooper pairing between electrons from conduction and valence bands from different valleys is formed. This finite-energy intervalley Cooper pairing has both even- and odd-frequency contributions. We show that there is a phase transition into formation of a robust macroscopic condensate of such Cooper pairs and present characteristics of the corresponding Higgs modes.</description>
