      <title>Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis Method for the 2-D Time-Independent Linearized Boltzmann Transport Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the novel Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis (TDIGA) method applied to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-independent 2-D linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) with higher-order scattering, discretized with discrete ordinates in angle, multigroup in energy, and isogeometric analysis (IGA) in space. We formulate operator assembly in the tensor train (TT) format, producing seven-dimensional operators for both fixed-source and $k$-eigenvalue neutron transport problems solved using the restarted Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) and power iteration with an uncompressed solution vector. Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format. We compare all results to Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic reference solutions. While CSR remains $&lt;10\times$ faster than this mixed format, the TDIGA method enables high-fidelity transport for expensive high-order IGA meshes.</description>

      <title>qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.</description>

      <title>Transformer Learning of Chaotic Collective Dynamics in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning reduced descriptions of chaotic many-body dynamics is fundamentally challenging: although microscopic equations are Markovian, collective observables exhibit strong memory and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and prediction errors. We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical "climate" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales. Our results establish self-attention as a powerful mechanism for learning effective reduced dynamics in chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Rimu.jl: Random integrators for many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rimu.jl is a Julia package for solving many-body quantum problems. The core of the package is a matrix-free implementation of Hamiltonians and other operators and compact representation of Fock states, which together allow for efficient methods suitable for high-performance computing. Rimu.jl includes a Julia implementation of the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm which is a type of projector QMC algorithm for stochastically solving the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. It also includes many well-known model Hamiltonians, and an interface for exact diagonalisation based on external eigenvalue solvers. Both the stochastic and exact diagonalisation methods are accessed with a CommonSolve.jl interface. We describe the FCIQMC algorithm and how to obtain estimators of observables as well as the key features of the implementation.</description>

      <title>MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>

      <title>Convolutional causal learning for aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers capturing aerodynamic causality from snapshot data with a time-varying mode decomposition technique referred to as information-theoretic machine learning. The current approach extracts time-dependent informative vortical structures, contributing to the future evolution of the aerodynamic coefficients. The present decomposition is employed with a convolutional neural network, enabling the identification of the spatial continuous mode. In addition, a low-order representation, characterizing the informative vortical structures and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients, can also be identified by considering autoencoder-based data compression. The present technique is applied to a range of aerodynamic examples, including extreme vortex-gust airfoil interactions, experimentally measured transverse jet-wing interaction, and a turbulent separated wake. For the cases of gust-wing interaction, the time-varying gust effect on the lift response is extracted in an interpretable manner. With the example of a turbulent wake, the relationship between large-scale vortical motion and lift force is identified without any spatial length-scale information. The proposed approach could serve as a foundation for data-driven causal modeling and control for a range of unsteady flows.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Adapted Analysis of Screw Dislocation: Electronic Structure and Carrier Recombination Mechanisms in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fundamental one-dimensional defects, screw dislocations profoundly reshape the energy landscape and carrier dynamics of crystalline materials. By restoring the exact algebra of the screw dislocation group, we unveil the latent symmetry constraints that govern the electronic structure, providing a more rigorous physical picture than the conventional treatments. When applied to GaN, the method yields a band-connectivity constraint and rigorous dipole selection rules for polarization-resolved transitions. Combined with computed Hamiltonian matrix, the approach gives symmetry-filtered radiative and dielectric calculations and reveals a piezoelectrical effect at the dislocation core that strongly suppresses radiative recombination. The pronounced dominance of non-radiative capture over radiative recombination highlights the detrimental impact of screw dislocations on the luminous efficiency of GaN, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing dislocation-limited optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Source-Based Physics-Driven Neural Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Unified Regularization of 2D Singular Integrals for Axisymmetric Galerkin BEM in Eddy-Current Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an axisymmetric Galerkin boundary element method (BEM) for modeling eddy-current interactions between excitation coils and conductive objects. The formulation derives boundary integral equations from the Stratton-Chu representation for the azimuthal component of the vector potential in both air and conductive regions. The central contribution is a unified regularization framework for the two-dimensional (2D) singular integrals arising in Galerkin BEM. This framework handles both logarithmic and Cauchy singularities through a common set of integral transformations, eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical singularity extraction and enabling straightforward numerical quadrature. The regularization and quadrature stability are proved and verified numerically. The method is validated on several representative axisymmetric geometries, including cylindrical, conical, and spherical shells. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently high accuracy and computational efficiency across broad frequency ranges and coil lift-off distances. The results confirm that the proposed axisymmetric Galerkin BEM, combined with the integral transformation technique, provides a robust and efficient framework for axisymmetric eddy-current nondestructive evaluation.</description>

      <title>On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Plasticity-based GND Density Estimation Methods in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations, accurately quantifying geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) is critical for capturing strain gradients in polycrystals. We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch.</description>

Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>

      <title>Reaching precise proton affinities in non-Born-Oppenheimer calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An attractive way to model nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons. This non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) method is known by many names including the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) and the multicomponent method. Two basis sets are typically used for such calculations: a nuclear basis set and an electronic basis set.
  In this work, we investigate the convergence of non-BO proton affinities (PAs) with respect to the protonic and electronic basis sets. PAs are a sensitive measure of the proton and electron densities. We demonstrate that most protonic basis sets are sufficient for non-BO density-functional calculations of PAs, resulting in convergence to within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete protonic basis set limit. This indicates that the truncation error is dominated by the electronic basis, and that smaller protonic basis sets could be developed.
  We show that non-BO calculations should use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons. The contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions, and uncontracting the electronic basis set on the quantized proton leads to significantly faster convergence to the electronic basis set limit. Uncontraction leads to results of one $\zeta$-level higher quality with negligible additional computational cost in multiple diffuse basis set families: Jensen's polarization consistent aug-pc-X basis sets, Dunning's correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZPD basis sets. In specific, the aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords PAs converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol when uncontracted on the quantum proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outstanding advances in solid-state laser technology, employing the optical parametric chirped-pulse-amplification (OPCPA) technique, have led physicists to focus laser pulses to highly-relativistic intensities which led to novel schemes for charged-particle acceleration and radiation generation in laser-driven plasmas. Microscopic understanding of these highly nonlinear processes is possible via accurate modeling of the laser-plasma interaction using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Numerous codes are available and they rely on finite difference time domain methods on Yee-grids or on the analytical solution of the Maxwell-equations in spectral space. In this work, we present a solution bridging these two methods, which we call finite difference exponential time domain solution. This method could provide a very high accuracy even in 3D, but with improved locality, similar to the pseudospectral analytical methods without relying on transformation to special basis functions. We verified the accuracy and the convergence of the method in various benchmarks, including laser propagation in vacuum and in underdense plasma. We also simulated electron injection in a non-linear laser-plasma wakefield acceleration and surface high-harmonic generation in the overdense regime. The results are then compared with those obtained from standard PIC codes.</description>

Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>
