      <title>X-Ray microtomography of mercury intruded compacted clay: An insight into the geometry of macropores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil properties, such as wetting collapse behavior and permeability, are strongly correlated to the soil microstructure. To date, several techniques including mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), can be used to characterize the microstructure of soil, but all techniques have their own limitations. In this study, the features of mercury that penetrated and has been entrapped in the pore network of the specimens through MIP testing were investigated by X-Ray microtomography (X-$\mu$CT), in order to give an insight into the geometry of macropores and possible ink-bottle geometry. Two conditions of water content and density were selected for the compacted Maryland clay. The distribution and geometry features of mercury entrapped in the microstructure after MIP were characterized and pore size distributions were also reconstructed. The results suggest that, for the two conditions studied in this paper, macropores were evenly distributed within the specimens, and most of them with a non-spherical shape, and with aspect ratio (ratio between the maximum and minimum thickness along a given segment) smaller than three. Different dominant entrance pore size of macropore was obtained from MIP and X-$\mu$CT, due to the specific experimental protocol used in tests and the effect of ink-bottle geometry. Only the large pore bodies with high aspect ratio were imaged in X-$\mu$CT, due to the extrusion of mercury during the process of depressurization and subsequent sample preparation for X- $\mu$CT. But entire pore space was accessible in MIP. The difference in dominant entrance pore size was more significant for specimens with lower void ratio due to a more pronounced aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees-of-Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Gravitational Attractions at small Accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational interactions were studied by measuring the influence of small external field masses on a microwave resonator. It consisted of two spherical mirrors, which acted as independent pendulumsindividually suspended by strings. Two identical field masses weremoved along the axis of the resonator symmetrically and periodically betweena near and a far position. Their gravitational interaction altered the distance between the mirrors, changing the resonance frequency, which was measured and found consistent with Newton's law of gravity.
  The acceleration of a single mirror caused by the two field masses at the closest position varied from $5.4 10^{-12} m/s^2$ to $259 10^{-12}\ m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>What is a degree of freedom? Configuration spaces and their topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding degrees of freedom in classical mechanics is fundamental to characterizing physical systems. Counting them is usually easy, especially if we can assign them a clear meaning. However, the precise definition of a degree of freedom is not usually presented in first-year physics courses since it requires mathematical knowledge only learned in more advanced courses. In this paper, we use a pedagogical approach motivated by simple but non-trivial mechanical examples to define degrees of freedom and configuration spaces. We highlight the role that topology plays in understanding these ideas.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport with constraints: from mirror descent to classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal trajectories for multiple traffic demands in a congested network is a challenging task. Optimal transport theory is a principled approach that has been used successfully to study various transportation problems. Its usage is limited by the lack of principled and flexible ways to incorporate realistic constraints. We propose a principled physics-based approach to impose constraints flexibly in such optimal transport problems. Constraints are included in mirror descent dynamics using the principle of D'Alembert-Lagrange from classical mechanics. This leads to a sparse, local and linear approximation of the feasible set leading in many cases to closed-form updates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic models of memristive behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under normal operations, memristive devices undergo variability in time and space and have internal dynamics. Interplay of memory and stochastic signal processing in memristive devices makes them candidates for performing bio-inspired tasks of information transduction and transformation, where intrinsic random behavior can be harnessed for high performance of circuits built up of individual memory storing elements. The paper discusses models of single memristive devices exhibiting both - dynamic hysteresis and Stochastic Resonance, addressing also the cooperative effect of correlated noises acting on the system and occurrence of dirty hysteretic rounding.</description>
