      <title>Can Media Act as a Soft Regulator of Safe AI Development? A Game Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit. Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator -- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.</description>

      <title>Remember when? Deciphering Ediacaran-Cambrian Metazoan behaviour and temporal memory using fossil movement paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the timing and trajectory of sensory system innovations is crucial for understanding the increase in phylogenetic, behavioural, and ecological diversity during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Elucidation of sensory adaptations has relied on either body-fossil evidence based on anatomical features or qualitative descriptions of trace-fossil morphology, leaving a gap in the record of sensory system innovations between the development of basic sensory capacities and that of more advanced sensory organs and brains. Here, we examine fossil movement trajectories of Ediacaran and Cambrian grazers for the presence of autocorrelation. Our analysis reveals a lack of temporal correlation in the studied Ediacaran trajectories and its presence in both analysed Cambrian trajectories, indicating time-tuned behaviours were in place by the early Cambrian. These results support the Cambrian Information Revolution hypothesis and indicates that increases in cognitive complexity and behavioural strategies were yet another important evolutionary innovation that occurred during the Ediacaran Cambrian transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Infection Spread and Hotspot Growth in Bi-Pathogen Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in our companion paper, we investigate how the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI) behave under different epidemiological and network conditions. Through numerical experiments, we study the effects of pathogen virulence, diffusion rates, and cross-diffusion on epidemic hotspot formation and long-term prevalence. Our results highlight the role of multiplex structure in amplifying or suppressing co-circulating infections, and provide quantitative insight into conditions that drive persistent epidemic patterns. Beyond epidemiology, these findings have broader implications for multiplex contagion processes such as information diffusion and malware propagation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity drives plasmid maintenance in large microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.</description>
