      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials can exhibit electronic topological features yet are inherently quasiperiodic. Nonetheless, the localizing tendency of quasiperiodicity can be prevented by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter spectrum of Chern bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in an external magnetic field. We first focus on a paradigmatic model of WSe$_2$, which can be described in an adiabatic approximation as particles moving in a periodic potential and an emergent periodic magnetic field with nonzero average. We understand the magnetic-field dependent spectra of WSe$_2$ based on the point net zero flux, at which the external field cancels the average emergent field. At this point, the band structure interpolates between the tightly-bound and nearly-free (weak periodic potential) paradigms as the twist angle increases. For small twist angles, the energy levels in a magnetic field mirror the Hofstadter butterfly of the Haldane model. For larger twist angles, the isolated Chern band at zero flux evolves from nearly-free bands at the point of net zero flux. We also apply our framework to a realistic model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, which has recently been suggested to feature higher Landau level analogs. We show that at negative unit flux per unit cell, the bands exhibit remarkable similarity to a backfolded parabolic dispersion, even though the adiabatic approximation is inapplicable. This backfolded parabolic dispersion naturally explains the similarity of the Chern bands at zero applied flux to the two lowest Landau levels, offering a simple picture supporting the emergence of non-Abelian states in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. We propose the study of magnetic field dependent band structures as a versatile method to investigate the nature of topological bands and identify Landau level analogs.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and unified non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially-localized edge modes, has led to numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to the traditional exponential localization, this manuscript reports a new kind of non-Hermitian skin effect, which we term the ``algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect." This effect emerges across a diverse spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in both two- and higher space dimensions. For 2D systems with algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect, on geometries such as a torus or cylinder, these systems exhibit behavior reminiscent of the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenmodes are either bulk Bloch waves (on a torus) or exponentially localized edge modes (on a cylinder). However, if the same system is placed on a disk or any geometrical shape featuring open boundaries in all directions, the skin modes immediately transform into the algebraic form, with amplitude decaying as a power-law function of the distance from the boundary. To explore these novel effects, we formulate a unified generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) framework that is universally applicable to all variations of non-Hermitian skin effects across any spatial dimension, developed through the usage of a generalized transfer-matrix approach. We find that in a $d$-dimensional non-Hermitian system, in general, the GBZ manifold's dimensionality must fall into the range from $d$ to $2d-1$, denoted by ${d \leq \dim\text{GBZ} \leq 2d-1}$. In 1D, this inequality is trivial because the upper and lower bounds converge, forcing the GBZ's dimensionality to match with that of the physical space. However, in 2D and above, this inequality indicates that there is no obligation for the GBZ's dimensionality to concur with the physical space's dimensionality, which gives rise to a new class of non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Magnetoconductance of Close-Packed CVD Bilayer Graphene Layer Stacking Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum valley Hall (QVH) domain wall states are a new class of one-dimensional (1D) one-way conductors that are topologically protected in the absence of valley mixing. Development beyond a single QVH channel raises important new questions as to how QVH channels in close spatial proximity interact with each other, and how that interaction may be controlled. Scalable epitaxial bilayer graphene synthesis produces layer stacking wall (LSW) bundles, where QVH channels are bound, providing an excellent platform to study QVH channel interactions. Here we show that distinct strain sources lead to the formation of both well-separated LSWs and close packed LSW bundles. Comparative studies of electronic transport in these two regimes reveal that close-packed LSW bundles support electrically tunable magnetoconductance. The coexistence of different strain sources offers a potential pathway to realize scalable quantum transport platform based on LSWs where electrically tunability enables programmable functionality.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in fluctuating imaginary gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exact solvability and point-gap topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian lattice models. These models incorporate site-dependent nonreciprocal hoppings $J e^{\pm g_n}$, facilitated by a spatially fluctuating imaginary gauge field $ig_n \hat~x$ that disrupts translational symmetry. By employing suitable imaginary gauge transformations, it is revealed that a lattice characterized by any given $g_n$ is spectrally equivalent to a lattice devoid of fields, under open boundary conditions. Furthermore, a system with closed boundaries can be simplified to a spectrally equivalent lattice featuring a uniform mean field $i\bar{g}\hat~x$. This framework offers a comprehensive method for analytically predicting spectral topological invariance and associated boundary localization phenomena for bond-disordered nonperiodic lattices. These predictions are made by analyzing gauge-transformed isospectral periodic lattices. Notably, for a lattice with quasiperiodic $g_n= \ln |\lambda \cos 2\pi \alpha n|$ and an irrational $\alpha$, a previously unknown topological phase transition is unveiled. It is observed that the topological spectral index $W$ assumes values of $-N$ or $+N$, leading to all $N$ open-boundary eigenstates localizing either at the right or left edge, solely dependent on the strength of the gauge field, where $\lambda&lt;2$ or $\lambda&gt;2$. A phase transition is identified at the critical point $\lambda\approx2$, at which all eigenstates undergo delocalization. The theory has been shown to be relevant for long-range hopping models and for higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sensing food quality by silicene nanosheets : a Density Functional Theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by food products are considered markers for assessing quality of food. In this work, first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods have been employed to model chemo-resistive gas sensor based on two-dimensional silicene based nanosheets that can sense the six different VOCs emitted by standard food products. Our calculations with unpassivated and flourine passivated silicene(F-silicene) sheets as sensor materials show that flourine passivated silicene has significantly better sensitivity towards all six VOC molecules (Acetone, Dimethylsulfide, Ethanol, Methanol, Methylacetate and Toluene). Moreover, flourinated silicene sensor is found to be capable of separately recognising four VOCs, a much better performance than r-GO used in a recent experiment. We analyse the microscopic picture influencing sensing capabilities of un-passivated and fluorinated silicene from the perspectives of adsorption energy, charge transfer and changes in the electronic structure. We find that better sensing ability of fluorinated silicene nanosheet can be correlated with the changes in the electronic structures near the Fermi level upon adsorption of different VOCs. The results imply that passivated silicene can work better as a sensor than r-GO in case of generic food VOCs. The results are important since modelling of various two-dimensional nano-sensors can be done in the similar way for detection of more complex VOCs emitted by specific food products.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity single-spin shuttling in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 {\mu}m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Orbital paramagnetism without density of states enhancement in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional orbital paramagnetism without enhancement of the density of states was recently discovered in the nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. Here, we propose a novel interband mechanism of orbital paramagnetism associated with the negative curvature of energy dispersions, which successfully explains the observed anomalous orbital paramagnetism. This negative curvature arises from energy fluctuations along the nodal line, inherent in realistic nodal-line materials. Our new mechanism indicates that such orbital paramagnetism serves as strong evidence for the existence of nodal lines not only in ZrSiS but potentially in various other nodal-line materials as well.</description>

      <title>Strong Repulsive Lifshitz-van der Waals Forces on Suspended Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding surface forces of two-dimensional (2D) materials is of fundamental importance as they govern molecular dynamics and atomic deposition in nanoscale proximity. Despite recent observations in wetting transparency and remote epitaxy on substrate-supported graphene, very little is known about the many-body effects on their van der Waals (vdW) interactions, such as the role of surrounding vacuum in wettability of suspended 2D monolayers. Here we report on a stark repulsive Lifshitz-van der Waals (vdW) force generated at surfaces of suspended 2D materials, arising from quantum fluctuation coupled with the atomic thickness and birefringence of 2D monolayer. In combination with our theoretical framework taking into account the many-body Lifshitz formulism, we present direct measurement of Lifshitz-vdW repulsion on suspended graphene using atomic force microscopy. We report a repulsive force of up to 1.4 kN/m$^2$ at a separation of 8.8 nm between a gold-coated AFM tip and a sheet of suspended graphene, more than two orders of magnitude greater than the Casimir-Lifshitz repulsion demonstrated in fluids. Our findings suggest that suspended 2D materials are intrinsically repulsive surfaces with substantially lowered wettability. The amplified Lifshitz-vdW repulsion could offer technological opportunities such as molecular actuation and controlled atomic assembly.</description>

      <title>Persistent currents in mesoscopic spin-orbit coupled rings due to an applied Zeeman field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent currents (PCs) in mesoscopic rings have been a subject of intense investigation since their proposal by B\"uttiker, Landauer, and Imry in 1983. In this paper, we explore the behavior of PC in spin-orbit coupled rings under the influence of a Zeeman field, contrasting it with traditional PC observed in rings threaded by magnetic flux. Our study reveals that the emergence of PC in our setup crucially depends on nonzero values of spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field. Through theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we uncover several intriguing phenomena. Specifically, in ballistic rings, we observe an inverse proportionality between PC and system size, with PC being zero at half filling for even numbers of sites. Additionally, the introduction of on-site disorder leads to the suppression of PC, with exponential decay observed for large disorder strengths and quadratic decay for smaller disorder strengths. Notably, disorder can enhance PC in individual samples, albeit with a configuration-averaged PC of zero. Furthermore, we find that the standard deviation of PC increases with disorder strength, reaching a maximum before decreasing to zero at high disorder strengths. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder in mesoscopic quantum systems, offering new avenues for theoretical exploration and experimental verification.</description>

Abstract: We present a model for an accurate description of the large-signal resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) dynamics, which allows for a simple and intuitive analysis in terms of dynamical trajectories in a phase space. We show that the RTD admittance can be accurately described by a simple RLRC equivalent circuit, which has a universal configuration, but with different circuit parameters in the large- and small-signal cases.</description>

      <title>Composite helical edges from Abelian fractional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge state made of a regular helical liquid carrying charge $e$ and a (fractionalized) helical liquid carrying charge $e/n$. A systematic framework is developed for these composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge states with $n=1,2,3$. For $n=2$, the composite edge state consists of a regular helical Luttinger liquid and a fractional topological insulator (the Abelian $Z_4$ topological order) edge state arising from half-filled conjugated Chern bands. The composite edge state with $n=2$ is pertinent to the recent twisted MoTe$_2$ experiment, suggesting a possible fractional topological insulator with conductance $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ per edge. Using bosonization, we construct generic phase diagrams in the presence of $weak$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In addition to a phase of free bosons, we find a time-reversal symmetry-breaking localized insulator, two perfect positive drag phases, a perfect negative drag phase (for $n=2,3$), a time-reversal symmetric Anderson localization (only for $n=1$), and a disorder-dominated metallic phase analogous to the $\nu=2/3$ disordered fractional quantum Hall edges (only for $n=3$). We further compute the two-terminal edge-state conductance, the primary experimental characterization for the (fractional) topological insulator. Remarkably, the negative drag phase gives rise to an unusual edge-state conductance, $(1-1/n)\frac{e^2}{h}$, not directly associated with the filling factor. We further investigate the effect of an applied in-plane magnetic field. For $n&gt;1$, the applied magnetic field can result in a phase with edge-state conductance $\frac{1}{n}\frac{e^2}{h}$, providing another testable signature. Our work establishes a systematic understanding of the composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations in core-shell spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toroidal dipole moments, which consist of enclosed circulating currents aligned along paths within a torus shape, can be experimentally achieved in metamaterials using various geometrical configurations. Here, we investigate the excitation of toroidal dipole moments in a core-shell nanosphere composed of dispersive materials within the framework of the Lorenz-Mie theory. By isolating the contributions related to volumetric oscillations of electric charges from those of transverse and radial current oscillations, we derive closed-form analytic expressions for the scattering coefficients associated with electric and magnetic toroidal dipole moments. These analytic expressions, obtained beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime and previously concealed within the Lorenz-Mie theory, agree with the Cartesian toroidal dipoles determined from the radial and transverse current oscillations. By exploring the resonances in these calculated coefficients, we demonstrate that the electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations can be manipulated and tuned for near- and far-field applications involving plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles and engineered metamaterials. We believe that our analytic results could shed light on some of the extraordinary effects obtained in Lorenz-Mie theory that depend on the interference of multipole coefficients, such as toroidal dipole-induced transparency, Fano resonances and superscattering of light.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Membrane-Based Scanning Force Microscopy Through an Optical Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new generation of strained silicon nitride resonators harbors great promise for scanning force microscopy, especially when combined with the extensive toolbox of cavity optomechanics. However, accessing a mechanical resonator inside an optical cavity with a scanning tip is challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a cavity-based scanning force microscope based on a silicon nitride membrane sensor. We overcome geometric constraints by making use of the extended nature of the mechanical resonator normal modes, which allows us to spatially separate the scanning and readout sites of the membrane. Our microscope is geared towards low-temperature applications in the zeptonewton regime, such as nanoscale nuclear spin detection and imaging.</description>

      <title>Braiding Topology of Non-Hermitian Open-Boundary Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest and progress on topological structures of the non-Hermitian Bloch bands. Here, we study the topological structures of non-Bloch bands of non-Hermitian multi-band quantum systems under open boundary conditions, which has received limited attention in prior studies. Using a continuity criterion and an efficient sub-GBZ algorithm, we establish a homotopic characterization -- braiding topology, e.g., characterized by the band's total vorticity -- for open-boundary bands and sub-GBZs. Such topological identification is robust without topological transition and emergent degenerate points, such as exceptional points. We further analyze the transition's impact on bands and spectral flows, including interesting properties unique to open boundaries, and numerically demonstrate our conclusions with tight-binding model examples. We unveil a crucial insight that open-boundary bands interchange their portions after encountering certain exceptional points. Our results enrich our foundational understanding of topological characterizations for generic non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional hydrodynamic viscous electron flow in annular Corbino rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of fluidic viscosity is ubiquitous in our everyday life and for it to arise the fluidic medium must necessarily form a continuum where macroscopic properties can emerge. While a powerful concept for tangible liquids, hydrodynamic manifestation of collective flow in electronic systems such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) has only been shown recently to occur in graphene and GaAs/AlGaAs. Here, we present nonlocal electronic transport measurements in concentric annular rings formed in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs and the resulting data strongly suggest that viscous hydrodynamic flow can occur far away from the source-drain current region. Our conclusion of viscous electronic transport is further corroborated by simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations that are found to be in agreement with our measurements below 1K temperature. Most importantly, our work emphasizes the key role played by viscosity via electron-electron (e-e) interaction when hydrodynamic transport is restricted radially, and for which a priori should not have played a major role.</description>

      <title>Coulomb drag in graphene/hBN/graphene moir\'e heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the observation of Coulomb drag between graphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moir\'e heterostructure with a moir\'e wavelength of ~10 nm and an intrinsic graphene with a lattice constant of ~0.25 nm. By tuning carrier densities of each graphene layer independently, we find that the charge carriers in moir\'e mini-bands, i.e., near the satellite Dirac point (sDP), can be coupled with the massless Fermions near the original Dirac point (oDP), strongly enough to generate a finite drag resistance. At high temperature ($T$) and large density ($n$), the drag resistances near both oDP and sDP follow a typical $n^{-1.5}$ and $T^2$ power law dependence as expected for the momentum transfer process and it also satisfies the layer reciprocity. In contrast, at low $T$, the layer reciprocity is broken in both regions that suggest dominant energy drag. Furthermore, quantitatively, the drag resistances near sDPs are smaller than those near oDP and they deviate from $T^2$ dependence below ~100 K. These results suggest that the coupling between the carriers in moir\'e mini-bands and those in original Dirac bands may not be of a simple Fermi liquid nature.</description>

      <title>Importance of the X-ray edge singularity for the detection of relic neutrinos in the PTOLEMY project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection of relic neutrinos in a beta-decay experiment is an ambitious goal that has long been beyond the reach of available technology. One of the most challenging practical difficulties for such an experiment is managing a large amount of radioactive material without compromising the energy resolution required to distinguish useful events from the substantial beta-decay background. The PTOLEMY project offers an innovative solution to this problem by depositing radioactive material on graphene. While this approach is expected to address the main challenge, it introduces new issues due to the proximity of the beta decayers to a solid-state system. In this work, we focus on the effect of the shakeup of the graphene electron system caused by a beta-decay event. We calculate the distortion of the relic neutrino peaks resulting from this shakeup, analyze the impact of the distortion on the visibility of neutrino capture events, and discuss potential technological solutions to enhance the visibility of these events.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for enchancing Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent limitations. In this work, we introduce the \textit{hyperfine structure of entanglement}, which dissects entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holographic duality, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality and extending bulk reconstruction; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction of stable nanoscale skyrmions in monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we predict stable isolated skyrmions with a diameter below 10 nm in a monolayer of the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, a material of significant experimental interest. A very large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is observed due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling for monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$. We show that the nearest-neighbor approximation, often used in literature, fails to describe the DMI. The strong DMI together with moderate in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy allows to stabilize nanoscale skyrmions in out-of-plane magnetic fields above $\approx 2$~T. The energy barriers of skyrmions in monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ are comparable to those of state-of-the-art transition-metal ultra-thin films. We further predict that these nanoscale skyrmions can be stable for hours at temperatures up to 20 K.</description>

      <title>Avoiding decoherence with giant atoms in a two-dimensional structured environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant atoms are quantum emitters that can couple to light at multiple discrete points. Such atoms have been shown to interact without decohering via a one-dimensional waveguide. Here, we study how giant atoms behave when coupled to a two-dimensional square lattice of coupled cavities, an environment characterized by a finite energy band and band gaps. In particular, we describe the role that bound states in the continuum (BICs) play in how giant atoms avoid decoherence. By developing numerical methods, we are able to investigate the dynamics of the system and show the appearance of interfering BICs within a single giant atom, as well as oscillating BICs between many giant atoms. In this way, we find the geometric arrangements of atomic coupling points that yield protection from decoherence in the two-dimensional lattice. These results on engineering the interaction between light and matter may find applications in quantum simulation and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N spectral sidebands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can estimate the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two sidebands spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectral signatures of non-Markovianity beyond the Born-Redfield master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory or time-non-local effects in open quantum dynamics pose theoretical as well as practical challenges in the understanding and control of noisy quantum systems. While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects.</description>
