      <title>COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold DM is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models), as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm DM (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wave numbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wave number and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wave numbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta&gt;0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}&lt;0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as supermassive black holes seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^{6-10}~M_{\odot}$) in the first cosmic Gyr ($z\gtrsim 6$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-$\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\sim 20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\sim 10^7\ M_\odot$ corresponding to $\sim 5-7\sigma$ fluctuations), and provides massive ($\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\odot}$) seeds by $z\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\rm seed}(z)=3.1\times 10^{5}\ { M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\times 10^{9}\ {M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\sim 6-7$ quasars can be explained with $6\times 10^4 M_{\rm \odot}$ seeds planted at $z\sim 32$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, $\langle\lambda_{\rm E}\rangle\sim 0.55$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1 ($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\sim 20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\rm \odot}$) seeds.

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmology is entering a very exciting time in its history, when a wealth of cutting-edge experiments are all starting to collect data, or about to. These experiments aim at addressing some of the most intriguing questions in fundamental physics, such as what is the nature of dark matter, is dark energy a cosmological constant or a varying field, what are the masses of the neutrinos, and more. While Lambda-CDM has emerged as a simple model that is consistent with most of the current data sets, we are starting to see some interesting deviations that deserve further exploration. This contribution provides an overview of upcoming projects and the science opportunities they will allow. In particular, we recall and comment the DESI year-1 BAO constraints and their implications for dark energy. We put some of the most recent results and outstanding questions in the perspective of the forthcoming observational program.</description>

      <title>Model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has been highly successful in predicting cosmic structure and evolution, yet recent precision measurements have highlighted discrepancies, especially in the Hubble constant inferred from local and early-Universe data. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>X-ray and optical analysis of the distant, merging double cluster SPT-CLJ2228-5828, its gas bridge, and shock front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers are excellent laboratories for studying a wide variety of different physical phenomena. Such a unique system is the distant SPT-CLJ2228-5828 cluster merger located at $z\approx 0.77$. Previous analyses via Sunyaev-Zeldovich and weak lensing data suggested that the system potentially was a dissociative cluster post-merger. In this work, we use new, deep XMM-Newton data to study the hot gas in X-rays, spectroscopic Gemini data to precisely determine the redshift of the two mass concentrations, and new HST data to improve the total mass estimates of the two components. We find that SPT-CLJ2228-5828 constitutes a pre-merging, double cluster system, instead of a post-merger. The merging process of the two clusters has started with their outskirt gas colliding with a $\sim 22^{\circ}-27^{\circ}$ on the plane of the sky. We fully characterize the surface brightness, gas density, temperature, pressure, and entropy profiles of the two merging clusters. The two systems have very similar X-ray properties with a moderate cluster mass of $M_{\text{tot}}\sim (2.1-2.4)\times 10^{14}\ M_{\odot}$. A $\approx 333$ kpc long gas bridge connecting the two clusters is detected at a $5.8\sigma$ level. The baryon overdensity of the excess bridge gas is $\delta_{\text{b}}\sim (75-320)$ across the length of the bridge and its gas mass is $M_{\text{gas}}\sim 1.4\times 10^{12}\ M_{\odot}$. Gas density and temperature jumps are also found across the gas bridge, revealing the existence of a weak shock front with a Mach number $\mathcal{M}\sim 1.1$. The gas pressure and entropy are also increased at the position of the shock front. We estimate the age of the shock front to be $\lesssim 100$ Myr and its kinetic energy $\sim 2.4\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. SPT-CLJ2228-5828 is the first such high-$z$ pre-merger with a gas bridge and a shock front to be studied in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Planck-PR4 anisotropy spectra show (better) consistency with General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from a series of analyses on two parametric tests of gravity that modify the growth of linear, sub-horizon matter perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. The first test, known as the $(\mu,\Sigma)$ framework, modifies the Poisson and lensing equations from General Relativity (GR). The second test introduces the growth index $\gamma$, which directly affects the time evolution of matter density perturbations. Our study is motivated by results from the analysis of the Planck-PR3 2018 spectra, which indicate a preference for $\Sigma_0 \neq 0$ and $\gamma_0 &gt; 0.55$, both of which deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at a significance level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$. To clarify the nature of these anomalous results and understand how the lensing anomaly fits into the picture, we analyze the most recent Planck-PR4 spectra extracted from the updated \texttt{NPIPE} maps. Overall, the Planck-PR4 data show better consistency with GR. The updated likelihood \texttt{Camspec} provides constraints on $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ that are consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. The updated likelihoods \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} show even closer agreement, with all parameter values consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within $1\sigma$. This enhanced consistency is closely correlated with the lensing anomaly. Across the different likelihoods, the tendency of $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ to drift towards non-standard values matches the observed preference for $A_L &gt; 1$, both of which are significantly reduced or disappear within the Planck-PR4 data.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on hunting HI filament with pairwise stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments stand as pivotal structures within the cosmic web. However, direct detection of the cold gas content of the filaments remains challenging due to its inherent low brightness temperature. With the TNG hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of isolating faint filament HI signal from the FAST HI intensity mapping (IM) survey through pairwise stacking of galaxies, which yields an average HI filament signal amplitude of $\sim 0.28\ {\mu{\rm K}}$ at $z\simeq 0.1$. However, our simulations reveal a non-negligible contribution from HI-rich galaxies within or near the filaments. Particularly, the faint galaxies dominantly contribute to the extra filament HI signal. Our simulation also shows that the measurement uncertainty is produced by both thermal noise and background variation caused by brightness leakage from surrounding random galaxies. Given a fixed total observation time, a wide-field HI IM survey, which includes a large number of galaxy pairs, can simultaneously reduce thermal noise to below the filament signal level and minimize background variation to a negligible level. Through the end-to-end simulation, this work demonstrates the critical role of the galaxy pairwise stacking method in future filament HI detection, outlining a road map for filament HI detection in the next-generation HI IM surveys.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Coupled Dark Energy Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether Neural Networks (NN) can accurately differentiate between growth-rate data of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, simulated via two models: a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model and a tomographic Coupled Dark Energy (CDE) model. We build an NN classifier and test its accuracy in distinguishing between cosmological models. For our dataset, we generate f{\sigma_8}(z) growth-rate observables simulating a realistic Stage IV galaxy survey-like setup, for both {\Lambda}CDM and a tomographic CDE model, for various values of the model parameters. We then optimise and train our NN with Optuna, aiming to avoid overfitting and maximising the accuracy of the trained model. We conduct our analysis for both a binary classification, comparing between {\Lambda}CDM and a CDE model where only one tomographic coupling bin is activated, and a multiclass classification scenario where all the models are combined. For the case of binary classification, we find that our NN can confidently (with &gt; 86% accuracy) detect non-zero values of the tomographic coupling regardless of the redshift range at which coupling is activated, and at a 100% confidence level, detect the {\Lambda}CDM model. For the multiclass classification task, we find that the NN performs adequately well at distinguishing between {\Lambda}CDM, a CDE model with low redshift coupling, and a model with high redshift coupling, with 99%, 79% and 84% accuracy respectively. By leveraging the power of machine learning, our pipeline can be a useful tool to analyse growth-rate data and maximise the potential of current surveys to probe for deviations from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from weak lensing, galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and tSZ: II. Optimizing Roman survey design for CMB cross-correlation science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore synergies between the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS) and CMB experiments, specifically Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-Stage4 (S4). Our simulated analyses include weak lensing, photometric galaxy clustering, CMB lensing, thermal SZ, and cross-correlations between these probes. While we assume the nominal 16,500 square degree area for SO and S4, we consider multiple survey designs for Roman that overlap with Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST): the 2000 square degree reference survey using four photometric bands, and two shallower single-band surveys that cover 10,000 and 18,000 square degree, respectively. We find a ~2x increase in the dark energy figure of merit when including CMB-S4 data for all Roman survey designs. We further find a strong increase in constraining power for the Roman wide survey scenario cases, despite the reduction in galaxy number density, and the increased systematic uncertainties assumed due to the single band coverage. Even when tripling the already worse systematic uncertainties in the Roman wide scenarios, which reduces the 10,000 square degree FoM from 269 to 178, we find that the larger survey area is still significantly preferred over the reference survey (FoM 64). We conclude that for the specific analysis choices and metrics of this paper, a Roman wide survey is unlikely to be systematics-limited (in the sense that one saturates the improvement that can be obtained by increasing survey area). We outline several specific implementations of a two-tier Roman survey (1000 square degree with 4 bands, and a second wide tier in one band) that can further mitigate the risk of systematics for Roman wide concepts.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

Abstract: The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>

      <title>Boxed in from all sides: a global fit to loopy dark matter and neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dark matter model that couples to the standard model through a one-loop interaction with neutrinos, where the mediator particles also generate neutrino masses. We perform a global fit that incorporates dark matter relic abundance, primordial nucleosynthesis, neutrino mass, collider and indirect detection constraints. Thanks to the loop suppression, large couplings are allowed, and we find that the model parameters are constrained on all sides. Dark matter masses from 10 MeV to a few TeV are allowed, but sub-GeV masses are preferred for the model to also account for the heaviest neutrino mass. Though our results are valid for a single neutrino mass eigenstate at a time, the model and methods are generalizable to the full 3-flavor case.</description>

      <title>The spectral density of astrophysical stochastic backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the spectral density of the stochastic background generated by the superposition of coalescing compact binaries. We show how the expression often used in the literature emerges from an average over the extrinsic parameters of the binaries (times of arrival, polarization angles, arrival directions and orbit inclinations) and how the Stokes parameters related to circular and linear polarization are set to zero by such averaging procedure. We then consider the effect of shot noise, i.e. the fact that for the superposition of a finite number of sources these averages are only approximate, and we show how it generates circular and linear polarizations (even for isotropic backgrounds) as well as spatial anisotropies, and we compute them explicitly for a realistic population of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Confusion noise from astrophysical backgrounds at third-generation gravitational-wave detector networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave detector networks, compact binaries coalescences produce a ``confusion noise'' due to unresolved sources and to the error in the reconstruction of resolved sources, that can degrade the sensitivity to cosmological backgrounds. We show how to characterize from first-principles this astrophysical confusion noise by reconstructing the resolved sources at a detector network, subtracting them from the data stream of each detector of the network, and then computing the correlation among detector pairs of these ``partially cleaned'' data streams that, beside instrumental noise, contain the unresolved sources and the error on the resolved sources. In a two-detector correlation, this residual astrophysical background then acts as an effective correlated noise. We point out that its effect, in the search for a cosmological background, must be evaluated by correlating two detectors with the filter function that optimizes the given cosmological search (and not the search for the astrophysical background itself) and therefore depends on the specific cosmological signal that we want to extract from the data. We show how to obtain search-independent upper bounds on the effect of this astrophysical confusion noise, and how to characterize its actual effect on a given cosmological search. We then apply this methodology to an example of a 3G network and, for a realistic population of mergers, we evaluate explicitly the upper bound on the effect of the astrophysical confusion noise, as well as its actual effect in the search of selected examples of power-law cosmological backgrounds and of backgrounds featuring broad peaks, as in phase transitions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM-like evolution in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory of gravity in a cosmological context using the formalism of dynamical systems. We obtain the equations of motion of the theory and introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to allow for a direct comparison with the results from General Relativity (GR). We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.</description>

Abstract: In June 2023, multiple PTA collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a SGWB. As a significant source of the SGWB, SIGW receive extensive attention. We explore the influence of anisotropic primordial power spectra on second-order SIGW and derive explicit expressions for the energy density spectra. For specific anisotropic inflation models, we analyze the impacts of Finslerian inflation and gauge field inflation models on PTA and LISA and generalize the findings to model-independent scenarios. Our results indicate that current PTA observations can not rule out the existence of small-scale anisotropic primordial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Impact of survey spatial variability on galaxy redshift distributions and the cosmological $3\times2$-point statistics for the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of spatial survey non-uniformity on the galaxy redshift distributions for forthcoming data releases of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Specifically, we construct a mock photometry dataset degraded by the Rubin OpSim observing conditions, and estimate photometric redshifts of the sample using a template-fitting photo-$z$ estimator, BPZ, and a machine learning method, FlexZBoost. We select the Gold sample, defined as $i&lt;25.3$ for 10 year LSST data, with an adjusted magnitude cut for each year and divide it into five tomographic redshift bins for the weak lensing lens and source samples. We quantify the change in the number of objects, mean redshift, and width of each tomographic bin as a function of the coadd $i$-band depth for 1-year (Y1), 3-year (Y3), and 5-year (Y5) data. In particular, Y3 and Y5 have large non-uniformity due to the rolling cadence of LSST, hence provide a worst-case scenario of the impact from non-uniformity. We find that these quantities typically increase with depth, and the variation can be $10-40\%$ at extreme depth values. Using Y3 as an example, we propagate the variable depth effect to the weak lensing $3\times2$pt analysis, and assess the impact on cosmological parameters via a Fisher forecast. We find that galaxy clustering is most susceptible to variable depth, and non-uniformity needs to be mitigated below $3\%$ to recover unbiased cosmological constraints. There is little impact on galaxy-shear and shear-shear power spectra, given the expected LSST Y3 noise.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization On Computers: Biases and Uncertainties in the Measured Mean Free Path at the End Stage of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations and analyses of absorption in quasar spectra suggest a rapid drop in the mean free path (MFP) at the late stage of reionization at $z\sim6$. We use the Cosmic Reionization on Computers simulation to examine potential biases in observed measurements of the MFP at the late stage of reionization, particularly in the presence of a quasar. We analyze three snapshots surrounding the `ankle' point of reionization history, when extended neutral patches of the intergalactic medium disappeared in the simulation box. Specifically, these are $z=6.8$ (true MFP $\approx 0.4$~pMpc), in addition to $z=6.1$ (true MFP $\approx 2$~pMpc) and $z=5.4$ (true MFP $\approx 6$~pMpc). We compare the inferred MFP $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ from synthetic spectra fits to the true MFP. We find that the mean Lyman continuum (LyC) profile at $z=6.8$ changes significantly with quasar lifetime $t_Q$. We attribute this sensitivity to $t_Q$ to a combination of extended neutral IGM patches and the prevalence of small-scale dense clumps. Consequently, the inferred MFP can be biased by a factor of few depending on $t_Q$. On the other hand, for the $z=6.1$ and $z=5.4$ snapshots, the mean LyC profile shows minimal sensitivity to variation in $t_Q\gtrsim 1$ Myr. The inferred MFP in these two cases is accurate to the $\lesssim 30\%$ level. Our results highlight how modeling systematics can affect the inferred MFP, particularly in the regime of small true MFP ($\lesssim 0.5$ pMpc). We also discuss the potential of this regime to provide a testing ground for constraining quasar lifetimes from LyC profiles.</description>

      <title>Constraining tensor-to-scalar ratio based on VLBI observations: PGWs induced-incoherence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induce a decrease of the spatial coherence length of an electromagnetic field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to eventually be unobservable, an affect called as blurring. Since this spatial correlation is actually observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational waves background. In this paper, we precisely evaluate this blurring effect by considering the primordial gravitational waves background to be in the so-called two-mode squeezed state, which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. We then exploit a sample of compact radio quasars located at redshift range $0.46\leq z \leq 2.73$ observed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) means. These quasars constitute a standard ruler and the angular size-distance $\theta-z$ relation is determined thanks to the measurement of their spatial coherence. These spatial coherence observations set an upper limit on the squeezing parameters of the PGWs background, which turns into an upper limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $\text{r}_{k_0}$. One finds $\text{r}_{k_0} &lt; 10^{-7}$, five orders of magnitude better than present constraints on this parameter with the CMB. This result is nevertheless compatible with the possible detection of a cosmic background by the pulsar timing array measurement. Further issues and caveats that potentially affect the results are reviewed. In particular, the possible effect of quantum-to-classical transition of PGWs is discussed. Ultimately, we promote the idea of using high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources as a new possible way of constraining the background of primordial tensor perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hubble constant tension within $f(R)$ modified gravity in the Jordan frame, focusing on its application to the dynamics of an isotropic Universe. A scalar field, non-minimally coupled to the metric, provides an extra degree of freedom compared to General Relativity. We analyze the impact of such a scalar field on the cosmic expansion, leading to an effective Hubble constant $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$, dependent on redshift $z$. We show that our $f(R)$ model might mimic dark energy and provide an apparent variation of the Hubble constant. Our results align with recent cosmological data analysis in redshift bins, indicating a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant. The redshift dependence of $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$ might potentially reconcile measurements of the Hubble constant from probes at different redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>
