      <title>Elastic instability of wormlike micelle solution flow in serpentine channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable "dead zones" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D "twists" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments.</description>

      <title>Galerkin reduced order model for two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Galerkin projection is used to build Reduced Order Models (ROM) for two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection with no-slip walls. We compare an uncoupled projection approach that uses separate orthonormal bases for velocity and temperature with a coupled formalism where the equations are projected onto a single basis combining velocity and temperature components. Orthonormal bases for modal projection are obtained as the eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian of the linearized RB equations. Various coupled and uncoupled ROMs with different number of modes are generated and validated against Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) over a wide range of Rayleigh numbers, $Ra$. DNS and ROM results are compared in terms of mean vertical profiles, heat flux, flow structures, bifurcation diagrams and energy spectra. Coupled ROMs are found to be unstable at high $Ra$ numbers with a stability limit that depends on the basis $Ra$. Uncoupled models show an increasing agreement with DNS as a function of the system dimension. It is found that for the system truncations investigated here, a quantitative agreement with DNS can be obtained up to $Ra\simeq 4\times 10^5$. ROMs are used to perform a bifurcation analysis for $Pr=10$ and the results compared to DNS. They qualitatively predict the transitions between periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic states as well as the spectral characteristics over a wide range of $Ra$ numbers. Overall, these results show that these ROMs reproduce the main flow features of RB convection and could be used as DNS-surrogates for the development of active control strategies and state estimation applications.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional turbulent condensates without bottom drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which statistical equilibrium theory is applicable to driven dissipative dynamics remains an important open question in many systems. We use extensive direct numerical simulations of the incompressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equation to examine the steady state of large-scale condensates in 2D turbulence at finite Reynolds number $Re$ in the absence of bottom drag. Large-scale condensates appear above a critical Reynolds number $Re_c\approx 4.19$. Close to this onset, we find a power-law scaling of the energy with $Re-Re_c$, with the energy spectrum at large scales following the absolute equilibrium form proposed by Kraichnan. At larger $Re$, the energy spectrum deviates from this form, displaying a steep power-law range at low wave numbers with exponent $-5$, with most of the energy dissipation occurring within the condensate at large scales. We show that this spectral exponent is consistent with the logarithmic radial vorticity profile of the condensate vortices predicted by quasi-linear theory for a viscously saturated condensate. Our findings shed new light on the classical problem of large-scale turbulent condensation in forced dissipative 2D flows in finite domains, showing that the large scales are close to equilibrium dynamics in weakly turbulent flows but not in the strong condensate regime with $Re\gg1$.</description>

      <title>Modelling Interfacial Dynamics Using Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory: Dynamic Contact Angles and the Role of Local Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) is applied to analyse dynamic contact angles of droplets in order to assess its predictive capability regarding wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale and to evaluate its feasibility for multiscale modelling. Hydrodynamic DFT incorporates the influence of fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces into a hydrodynamic theory by including a thermodynamic model based on classical DFT for the chemical potential of inhomogeneous fluids. It simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations far away from interfaces, thus connecting microscopic molecular modelling and continuum fluid dynamics. In this work we use a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and the viscosity is obtained from generalised entropy scaling, a one-parameter model which takes microscopic information of the fluid and solid phase into account. Deterministic (noise-free) density and velocity profiles reveal wetting phenomena including different advancing and receding contact angles, the transition from equilibrium to steady state and the rolling motion of droplets. Compared to a viscosity model based on bulk values, generalised entropy scaling provides more accurate results, which stresses the importance of including microscopic information in the local viscosity model. Hydrodynamic DFT is transferable as it captures the influence of different external forces, wetting strengths and (molecular) solid roughness. For all results good quantitative agreement with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations is found, which emphasises that hydrodynamic DFT is able to predict wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Turbulence transport in moderately dense gas--particle compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs three-dimensional particle-resolved simulations of planar shocks passing through a suspension of stationary solid particles to study wake-induced gas-phase velocity fluctuations, termed pseudo-turbulence. Strong coupling through interphase momentum and energy exchange generates unsteady wakes and shocklets in the interstitial space between particles. A Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field shows that the majority of pseudo-turbulence is contained in the solenoidal component from particle wakes, whereas the dilatational component corresponds to the downstream edge of the particle curtain where the flow chokes. One-dimensional phase-averaged statistics of pseudo-turbulent kinetic energy (PTKE) are quantified at various stages of flow development. Reduction in PTKE is observed with increasing shock Mach number due to decreased production, consistent with single-phase compressible turbulence. The anisotropy in Reynolds stresses is found to be relatively constant through the curtain and consistent over all the conditions simulated. Analysis of the budget of PTKE shows that the majority of turbulence is produced through drag and balanced by viscous dissipation. The energy spectra of the streamwise gas-phase velocity fluctuations reveal an inertial subrange that begins at the mean interparticle spacing and decays with a power law of $-5/3$ and steepens to $-3$ at scales much smaller than the particle diameter. A two-equation model is proposed for PTKE and its dissipation. The model is implemented within a hyperbolic Eulerian-based two-fluid model and shows excellent agreement with the particle-resolved simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiple Equilibria Enables Tunable Wetting of Droplets on Patterned Liquid Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterning solid surfaces with varying wettability is important to manage droplets in microfluidics, heat transfer and printing. Solid surface roughness poses fundamental limitations including contact-line pinning and solid friction. Here, we report an experimental strategy and theoretical design principles for Patterned Liquid Surfaces (PaLS) that combines the controlled wettability from patterning with the ultra-smoothness of a lubricant-infused surface. In contrast to a solid, on PaLS a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants, and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability whilst removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data. Our results provide a distinct approach to surface patterning that exploits the interaction of fluids with lubricant-impregnated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Passive scalar dispersion along porous stratum with natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate horizontal dispersion of a passive scalar in a porous stratum with Rayleigh-Darcy convection initiated by a geothermal gradient. While increasing Rayleigh number ($Ra$) keeps enhancing convection, the horizontal dispersion coefficient ($\hat{D}$) only scales with Ra in a narrow range, and saturates at $Ra \gtrsim 2500$. We rationalize this two-stage behavior: at low Ra, passive scalar migrates through bulk circumflex; at high Ra, boundary micro-plume layer becomes the dominant scalar pathway. Theory gives saturate $\hat{D}$ value proportional to the Lewis number $Le$ and molecular diffusivity $D_0$.</description>

      <title>Griffin Plots of vortex-induced vibrations: revealing self-similarity for quick estimation from transient displacement responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Griffin plot relates the peak amplitudes of vortex-induced vibration to structrual mass-damping parameter, known as the Scruton number. Griffin plot serves as a fundamental tool in many engineering fields. This study confirms a general self-similarity in Griffin plots, where plots derived from transient responses at any Scruton number converge to a single, consisten curve. This self-similarity arises from weak aeroelastic nonlinearity in vortex-induced vibration, manifasting as amplitude-dependent aerodynamic damping. Based on this self-similarity property, we propose a numerical method to estimate Griffin plots from transient displacement responses at any Scruton number. The resulting plots align closely with experimental data for both cross-flow and torsional vortex-induced vibrations, highlighting robust self-similar behavior across different Scruton numbers. Furthermore, we observe a consistent trend in Griffin plots for a rectangular cylinder, closed-box, and double-girder bridge deck: the reciprocal of peak amplitudes shows an approximately linear relationship with the Scruton number, especially in torsional vortex-induced vibration. To generate this linearity, we develop a simple empirical model of vortex-induced forces. This model accurately reproduces the Griffin plot for a rectangular cylinder using aeroelastic parameters derived from a single Scruton number, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning Distributions of Complex Fluid Simulations with Diffusion Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with complex unsteady dynamics, such as fluid flows, are often poorly represented by a single mean solution. For many practical applications, it is crucial to access the full distribution of possible states, from which relevant statistics (e.g., RMS and two-point correlations) can be derived. Here, we propose a graph-based latent diffusion (or alternatively, flow-matching) model that enables direct sampling of states from their equilibrium distribution, given a mesh discretization of the system and its physical parameters. This allows for the efficient computation of flow statistics without running long and expensive numerical simulations. The graph-based structure enables operations on unstructured meshes, which is critical for representing complex geometries with spatially localized high gradients, while latent-space diffusion modeling with a multi-scale GNN allows for efficient learning and inference of entire distributions of solutions. A key finding is that the proposed networks can accurately learn full distributions even when trained on incomplete data from relatively short simulations. We apply this method to a range of fluid dynamics tasks, such as predicting pressure distributions on 3D wing models in turbulent flow, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging scenarios. The ability to directly sample accurate solutions, and capturing their diversity from short ground-truth simulations, is highly promising for complex scientific modeling tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring dynamics and show how the observed states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase separating mixtures.</description>

      <title>A gas-surface interaction algorithm for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows: For Maxwell boundary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rarefied flow and multi-scale flow are crucial for the aerodynamic design of spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete velocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can capture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow behaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied regimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other multi-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and plasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the gas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and unified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be regarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full accommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending DVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real multi-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework by constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an adjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems of macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well solved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function and interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that the multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is essential. From the perspective of generality, the GSI is forced on UVS. Besides, by combined with the unified method (the unified gas-kinetic scheme in the paper), the effectiveness and validity of the present GSI on the DVM framework are verified by a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>A global adaptive velocity space for general discrete velocity framework in predictions of rarefied and multi-scale flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rarefied flow and multi-scale flow are crucial for the aerodynamic design of spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete velocity space, the Boltzmann method, such as the discrete velocity method and unified methods, can capture complex and non-equilibrium velocity distribution functions (VDFs) and describe flow behaviors exactly. However, the extremely steep slope and high concentration of the gas VDFs in a local particle velocity space make it very difficult for the Boltzmann method with structured velocity space to describe high speed flow. Therefore, the adaptive velocity space (AVS) is required for the Boltzmann solvers to be practical in complex rarefied flow and multi-scale flow. This paper makes two improvements to the AVS approach, which is then incorporated into a general discrete velocity framework, such as the unified gas-kinetic scheme. Firstly, a global velocity mesh is used to prevent the interpolation of the VDFs at the physical interface during the calculation of the microscopic fluxes, maintaining the program's high level of parallelism. Secondly, rather than utilizing costly interpolation, the VDFs on a new velocity space were reconstruction using the ``consanguinity" relationship. In other words, a split child node's VDF is the same as its parent's VDF, and a merged parent's VDF is the average of its children's VDFs. Additionally, the discrete deviation of the equilibrium distribution functions is employed to maintain the proposed method's conservation. Moreover, an appropriate set of adaptive parameters is established to enhance the automation of the proposed method. Finally, a number of numerical tests are carried out to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A novel Cercignani-Lampis boundary model for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To extend the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods to more realistic boundary conditions, a Cercignani-Lampis (CL) boundary with different momentum and thermal energy accommodations is proposed and integrated into the DVM framework. By giving the macroscopic flux from the numerical quadrature of the incident molecular distribution, the reflected macroscopic flux can be obtained for the given accommodation coefficients. Then, an anisotropic Gaussian distribution can be found for the reflected molecules, whose parameters are determined by the calculated reflected macroscopic flux. These macroscopic flux and microscopic Gaussian distribution form a complete physical process for the reflected molecules. Furthermore, the CL boundary is integrated into the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), making it suitable for the simulation of both monatomic and diatomic gas flows, and it accommodates both the conventional Cartesian velocity space and the recently developed efficient unstructured velocity space. Moreover, this new GSI boundary is suitable for both explicit and implicit schemes, offering better performance for flow prediction. Finally, the performance of the new boundary is validated through a series of numerical tests covering a wide range of Knudsen and Mach numbers.</description>

Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur depending on the physical properties of the external layers surrounding the flow active domain. The strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers with the large variation of the critical magnetic Reynolds number can be related to the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In contrast to the kinematic models, the nonlinear MHD simulations reveal a small scale dynamo solution with the magnetic energy remaining significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small.</description>

      <title>Noise-expansion cascade: an origin of randomness of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomness is one of the most important characteristics of turbulence, but its origin remains an open question. By means of a ``thought experiment'' via several clean numerical experiments based on the Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal a new phenomenon, which we call the ``noise-expansion cascade'' whereby all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitudes in the initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level. More importantly, each noise/disturbance input may greatly change the macro-level characteristics and statistics of the resulting turbulence, clearly indicating that micro-level noise/disturbance might have great influence on macro-level characteristics and statistics of turbulence. Besides, the noise-expansion cascade closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence, thus revealing an origin of randomness of turbulence. This also highly suggests that unavoidable thermal fluctuations must be considered when simulating turbulence, even if such fluctuations are several orders of magnitudes smaller than other external environmental disturbances. Hopefully, the ``noise-expansion cascade'' as a fundamental property of the NS equations could greatly deepen our understandings about turbulence, and besides is helpful for attacking the fourth millennium problem posed by Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.</description>

      <title>On the estimation of specific interfacial areas in aerated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a short clarification on the definition of specific interfacial areas in aerated flows, thereby distinguishing between the specific interfacial area related to the volume of an air-water mixture, and the specific interfacial area related to the water volume. This distinction is important when it comes to solving the air-water mass transfer equation, as there has been some misconception on the past. It is hoped that this contribution will help to clarify on these basic fundamentals, which is anticipated to be important for the future development and application of advanced air-water mass transfer models to aerated flows.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks</title>

Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reduced-order Koopman model for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic data-driven reduced-order model applicable to a wide range of turbulent natural and engineering flows is presented. Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data.</description>

      <title>Conserved discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme with unstructured discrete velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is a multi-scale numerical method for flows from continuum limit to free molecular limit, and is especially suitable for the simulation of multi-scale flows, benefiting from its multi-scale property. To reduce integration error of the DUGKS and ensure the conservation property of the collision term in isothermal flow simulations, a Conserved-DUGKS (C-DUGKS) is proposed. On the other hand, both DUGKS and C-DUGKS adopt Cartesian-type discrete velocity space, in which Gaussian and Newton-Cotes numerical quadrature are used for calculating the macroscopic physical variables in low speed and high speed flows, respectively. While, the Cartesian-type discrete velocity space leads to huge computational cost and memory demand. In this paper, the isothermal C-DUGKS is extended to the non-isothermal case by adopting coupled mass and inertial energy distribution functions. Moreover, since the unstructured mesh, such as the triangular mesh in two dimensional case, is more flexible than the structured Cartesian mesh, it is introduced to the discrete velocity space of C-DUGKS, such that more discrete velocity points can be arranged in the velocity regions that enclose large number of molecules, and only a few discrete velocity points need to be arranged in the velocity regions with small amount of molecules in it. By using the unstructured discrete velocity space, the computational efficiency of C-DUGKS is significantly increased. A series of numerical tests in a wide range of Knudsen numbers, such as the Couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow, two-dimensional rarefied Riemann problem and the supersonic cylinder flows, are carried out to examine the validity and efficiency of the present method.</description>

      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, the core task of flow networks is to transport solutes and perfuse all cells or media equally with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and self-organize their geometry for homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that also artificial flow networks can self-organize toward homogeneous perfusion by the versatile adaption of controlled erosion. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of the eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to the homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>
