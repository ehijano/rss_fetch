      <title>Neural simulation-based inference of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling via off-shell Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.</description>

      <title>Probing Top Quark - Electron Interactions at Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top quark interactions offer a window into possible new high scale physics and many models of new physics predict that the top quark interactions will deviate significantly from those predicted by the Standard Model (SM). We present an analysis of the experimental restrictions on anomalous 4-fermion $e^+e^- t {\overline{t}}$ operators that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in both the electroweak and QCD interactions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. At NLO, there is sensitivity to an extended set of anomalous interactions beyond those probed at leading order. A comparison of current limits from electroweak precision observables, along with expected future limits from Drell-Yan and $t{\overline{t}}e^+e^-$ production at the high luminosity LHC, from deep inelastic scattering at the EIC, and from projected sensitivities at the future FCC-ee and CEPC machines demonstrates that each of these programs extends the precision understanding of the interactions of top quarks.</description>

      <title>From Fluctuation to Polarization: Imprints of $O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ Curvature Perturbations in CMB B-modes from Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing primordial curvature perturbations on small scales, beyond those accessible using cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, remains a major open challenge. Current constraints on the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on model-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we propose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using scalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature perturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While induced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the stochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary observable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the CMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced scalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with inflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in upcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4. We map the region of the scalar power spectrum to which these future B-mode experiments will be sensitive and compare with existing constraints, finding it to exceed current sensitivities at $k \sim O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In addition to providing a new CMB-based probe of the small-scale power spectrum, this work also motivates dedicated B-mode searches at higher multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 100$).</description>

      <title>Enabling Sub-GeV Dark Matter within the Vanilla $L_\mu$-$L_\tau$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter is a compelling setup that has been probed by a multitude of experiments, mostly in the GeV-TeV mass range. The thermal paradigm in the sub-GeV range is about to experience the same experimental test with the next generation of low-energy accelerators and light dark matter detectors. Motivated by this, we investigate sub-GeV dark matter in the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ and assess how the introduction of a matter-dominated era impacts the parameter that yields the correct relic density. Interestingly, we show that the projected experiments, such as MuSIC, FCC-ee, and LDMX, will probe a large region of the viable parameter space that yields the correct relic density. In the GeV-TeV mass regime, the usual large-scale detectors push the sensitivity. Our work highlights the rich interplay between early-universe dynamics, dark matter phenomenology, and the discovery potential of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Stacking the Deck: Gambling on a Light QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider axions lighter than what their QCD couplings might otherwise suggest. Starting with a $\mathbb{Z}_N$-axion, we introduce a small explicit $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-breaking coupling between the Standard Model Higgs boson and a reheaton. This small explicit breaking allows us to populate a large portion of the light axion $m_a$-$f_a$ plane, removes the $1/N$ tuning in the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-axion, and explains why only our sector was reheated. Due to finite temperature effects, axions of this sort undergo either ``rigged" misalignment, where the axion misalignment angle is effectively $\pi$ regardless of its initial value; or ``shuffled" misalignment, where the initial angle is effectively randomized.</description>

      <title>Primordial high energy neutrinos: theoretical/observational constraints and sharp spectral features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the few ways that allow or could allow us to probe the early Universe from the observation of a flux of primordial particles, there is one possibility which has been little studied: the observation today of high energy neutrinos which could have been emitted shortly after the Big Bang, from the decay or annihilation of early universe relics. We perform a general study of such a possibility. To this end we first emphasise that these neutrinos could display various kinds of sharp spectral features, resulting from the primary energy spectrum at emission, and from how this spectrum is smoothed by redshift and radiative correction effects. Next we determine the ranges of mass (from a fraction of eV all the way to the Planck scale) and lifetime of the source particles along which we do not/we do expect that the sharp spectral feature will be altered by interactions of the neutrinos on their way to the detector, mainly with the cosmic neutrino background or between themselves. We also study the theoretical (i.e. mainly BBN and CMB) and observational constraints which hold on such a possibility. This allows us to delineate the regions of parameter space (mass, lifetime and abundance) that are already excluded, hopeless for future observation or, instead, which could lead to the observation of such neutrinos in the near future.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations with NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>$\Xi(1530)$ production in $K^{-}p$ scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the production of $\Xi(1530)$ in the $K^- p \to K^{+} \Xi(1530)^{-}$ and $K^- p \to K^{0} \Xi(1530)^{0}$ processes by utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach. In order to fit the cross sections for both processes, we include nine $\Lambda/\Sigma$ hyperons and their resonances in the $s$- and $u$-channel processes. Due to the inconsistency of the measured cross sections for $K^- p \to K^+ \Xi(1530)^-$ in the range $\sqrt{s}=[2.087, 2.168]\ \mathrm{GeV}$, we perform the fitting with all the experimental data having the same weight (model A) and different weight (model B) in the present work. Based on a comparative analysis of the fit results in two models, we conclude that Model A demonstrates a better global agreement with the experimental data than Model B. In addition to the cross sections, the individual contributions from different intermediate states to the cross sections are also estimated . Our results indicate that the cross section resulted from $\Sigma(1193)$ intermediate process is predominant. Moreover, the different cross sections are predicted for both the charged and neutral processes with several typical center-of-mass energies, which could be tested by further experimental measurements at J-PARC in the future.</description>

      <title>Analyzing $t\bar{t}Z$-couplings at the future $e^-p$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), with center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}\approx 1.3$ TeV, provides a clean and sensitive environment to probe the top quark's neutral current interactions with the $Z$ boson via the process $e^- p \to e^- t \bar{t}$. We investigate the precision with which the Standard Model (SM) $t\bar{t}Z$ couplings-the vector and axial-vector components ($\Delta C_{1V}$, $\Delta C_{1A}$)-can be measured, along with possible new physics effects parameterized by higher-dimensional operators inducing weak electric and magnetic dipole-like interactions ($C_{2V}$, $C_{2A}$). Focusing on the semileptonic decay channel, where either the top quark or anti-top decays leptonically to a positively charged lepton ($\ell^+ = e^+, \mu^+$), we utilize the azimuthal angle difference $\Delta \phi$ between the scattered electron and the charged lepton as the key observable. Using a one-parameter multi-bin $\chi^2$-analysis of this differential distribution, we find that constraints on $\Delta C_{1V}$ and $\Delta C_{1A}$ improve from order $10^{-1}$ at 50 fb$^{-1}$ to order $10^{-2}$ at 1000 fb$^{-1}$, corresponding to approximately 50% and 6% precision relative to their SM values. The anomalous tensor couplings $C_{2V}$ and $C_{2A}$ are constrained at the $10^{-1}$ level even at low luminosity and improve moderately with high luminosity. While the two-parameter analysis broadens the allowed regions due to parameter correlations, it retains competitive sensitivity, particularly for SM-like couplings. A systematic uncertainty of 5% is assumed throughout. These results highlight the LHeC's potential to provide complementary and competitive sensitivity to top-$Z$ couplings compared to current and future hadron and lepton collider capabilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the chiral kinetic theory in a non-Abelian gauge field using a self-consistent semiclassical expansion. Within this new expansion scheme, we disentangle the Wigner equations up to second order and demonstrate that they do not introduce additional constraint equations. By integrating the covariant chiral kinetic equations in eight-dimensional phase space, we obtain the corresponding equations in seven-dimensional phase space. This reduction facilitates numerical simulations and practical applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the heavy pentaquark chiral perturbation theory, we calculate the chiral corrections for $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ octet hidden-charm pentaquark masses up to next-to-leading order. Taking the LHCb-reported $P_{\psi}^N(4440)$ and $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ (with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$) as inputs, we predict the other two octet hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}(4483)$ and $P_{\psi ss}^{N}(4490)$ with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$. The results provide theoretical guidance for the further search of $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}$ and $P_{\psi ss}^{N}$ in experiments.</description>

      <title>Matching from quark to hadronic operators: external source vs spurion methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various weak processes at the hadronic scale have been utilized to search for new physics at high energy scale, which can be described by the QCD chiral Lagrangian matched from the low-energy effective theory (LEFT). Utilizing the chiral symmetry $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \to SU(2)_V$ at the quark and hadronic levels, we make a comprehensive comparison of various matching methods, including the external source method, conventional spurion method, and our systematic spurion method. Although different methods show agreements for dimension-6 LEFT operator matching, we find that for higher-dimensional operators, the external source method is quite limited or inapplicable, the conventional spurion methods needs to introduce more and more spurions, while our spurion method does not need to introduce any new spurions than the ones in the dimension-6 matching. Using minimal set of spurions, we thus establish an one-to-one correspondence between the LEFT and chiral operators, with several examples, such as derivative operators at dimensions 7 and 8 with a single bilinear, four-quark operators at the dimension-9 level with two quark bilinears, which can be applied to the study of neutrino/electron scatterings and neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>LHC and dark matter implications of t-b-{\tau} Yukawa unification in split SUSY GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a grand unification (GUT) inspired version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)
  based on a left-right symmetric $4$-$2$-$2$ gauge group, incorporating Yukawa coupling unification and current
  phenomenological constraints. Utilizing a split soft supersymmetry-breaking (SSB) parameter space motivated by
  flavor symmetries, we analyze the implications of recent results from ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and dark matter direct
  detection experiments. Our numerical scans, conducted with SARAH and SPheno, identify viable low-energy regions
  consistent with third-generation Yukawa unification, the observed Higgs boson mass, dark matter relic density,
  and flavor observables such as $B \to X_s \gamma$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B_u \to \tau \nu_{\tau}$ .
  Our findings suggest that while current bounds severely constrain much of the
  MSSM-like parameter space, substantial regions remain experimentally viable and testable in the ongoing LHC run
  and next-generation dark matter experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate di-Higgs production at the (HL-)LHC and possible high-energy future $e^+e^-$ colliders within the real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM), the RxSM. This model has two CP-even Higgs bosons, $h$ and $H$, for which we assume $m_h\sim 125 \text{ GeV} &lt; m_H$. We analyse the effect of one-loop corrections to the two trilinear scalar couplings relevant for di-Higgs production, $\lambda_{hhh}$ and $\lambda_{hhH}$, by performing an extensive parameter scan within the RxSM. We find that the one-loop corrections have a strong impact on the total production cross-sections, as well as on the differential cross-sections with respect to the invariant di-Higgs mass, $m_{hh}$. We evaluate the sensitivity of the HL-LHC and a high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider with $\sqrt{s} = 1 \text{ TeV}$, the ILC1000, to probe BSM physics effects in these processes. We demonstrate that the RxSM can be distinguished from the SM for large parts of the sampled parameter space. The resonant $H$ structure in the $m_{hh}$ distribution, on the other hand, can be observed only if the corresponding couplings, in particular $\lambda_{hhH}$, are sufficiently large. Here the ILC1000 yields a substantially better sensitivity than the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Gauge Quanta Produced during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to a gauge field via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta, which can act as a source of gravitational waves (GWs) with potentially observable amplitudes. In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-term effects on isospin asymmetric hot and dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the CP-violating $\theta$ term on isospin symmetry breaking in quark matter and compact star properties using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. By incorporating the $\theta$ parameter through the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction, we derive the thermodynamic potential and gap equations under finite temperature, baryon chemical potential, and isospin chemical potential. At zero temperature and baryon density, $\theta$ suppresses conventional chiral ($\sigma$) and pion ($\pi$) condensates while promoting pseudo-scalar ($\eta$) and scalar-isovector ($\delta$) condensates, thereby reducing the critical isospin chemical potential $\mu_I^{\text{crit}}$ for spontaneous symmetry breaking. For $\theta=\pi$, a first-order phase transition emerges at $\mu_I^{\text{crit}} = 0.021$ GeV, accompanied by CP symmetry restoration. Extending the investigation to finite temperature and baryon chemical potential reveals that these $\theta$-term-induced effects persist. Axion effects (modeled via $\theta\equiv a/f_a$) stiffen the equation of state (EOS) of non-strange quark stars, increasing their maximum mass and radii, in agreement with multimessenger constraints from pulsar observations and gravitational wave events. These results establish $\theta$ as a critical parameter modulating both the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure and compact star observables.</description>

      <title>The Yukawa potential of a non-homogeneous sphere, with new limits on an ultralight boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely weak long-range forces may lead to apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle. The final MICROSCOPE result, leading at 95 % c.l. to $|\delta| &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-15}$ or $6.5 \times 10^{-15}$ for a positive or negative E\"otv\"os parameter $\delta$, requires taking into account the spin of the mediator, and the sign of $\Delta (Q/A_r)_{\rm{Ti-Pt}}$ ($Q$ denoting the new charge involved). A coupling to $B-L$ or $B$ should verify $|g_{B-L}|&lt;1.1 \times 10^{-25}$ or $|g_{B}| &lt; 8 \times 10^{-25}$, for a spin-1 mediator of mass $m &lt; 10^{-14}$ eV$/c^2$, with slightly different limits of $1.3 \times 10^{-25}$ or $\,6.6 \times 10^{-25}$ in the spin-0 case.
  The limits increase with $m$, in a way which depends on the density distribution within the Earth. This involves an hyperbolic form factor, expressed through a bilateral Laplace transform as $\Phi(x=mR)= \langle\,\sinh mr/mr \,\rangle$, related by analytic continuation to the Earth form factor $\Phi(ix)= \langle \,\sin mr/mr \,\rangle $. It may be expressed as $\Phi(x) = \frac{3}{x^2}\, (\cosh x - \frac{\sinh x}{x}) \times\, \bar\rho(x)/\rho_0\,$, where $\bar\rho(x)$ is an effective density, decreasing from the average $\rho_0$ at $m=0$ down to the density at the periphery.
  We give general integral or multishell expressions of $\Phi(x)$, evaluating it, and $\bar\rho(x)$, in a simplified 5-shell model. $\Phi(x)$ may be expanded as $\, \sum \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n+1)!} \frac{\langle \,r^{2n}\,\rangle}{R^{2n}}
  \simeq 1 + .0827\ x^2 + .00271 \ x^4 + 4.78 \times 10^{-5}\,x^6 + 5.26\times 10^{-7}\, x^8 +\ ... \ $, absolutely convergent for all $x$ and potentially useful up to $x\approx 5$. The coupling limits increase at large $x$ like $mR \ e^{mz/2}/\sqrt{1+mr}$ ($z=r-R$ being the satellite altitude), getting multiplied by $\simeq 1.9,\ 34$, or $1.2\times 10^9$, for $m = 10^{-13},\ 10^{-12}$ or $10^{-11}$ eV$/c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining color-charge effects of partonic energy loss with jet axis-based inclusive jet substructure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium and the associated relative modifications of quark and gluon jet fractions compared to vacuum, using jet axis decorrelation observables. Recent CMS jet axis decorrelation measurements in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are interpreted using Pythia simulations with varied quark/gluon jet compositions and emulated color-charge dependent energy loss. A template-fit procedure is employed to estimate the limits on gluon jet fractions in the published CMS data and average shift in jet momentum due to quenching for quark- and gluon-initiated jets traversing the QGP. The extracted gluon jet fractions and the estimated quark and gluon energy losses based on this study of jet axis decorrelations are found to be consistent with other model calculations based on inclusive observables. This work illustrates the use of jet substructure measurements for providing constraints on the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss and offers valuable insights for jet quenching models.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mixing parameters and masses from $\Delta(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive model independent analysis of all breaking patterns resulting from $\Delta(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach of the minimal seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos. The three generations of left-handed lepton doublets are assumed to transform as the irreducible triplet $\bm{3_{0}}$ of $\Delta(96)$, and the two right-handed neutrinos are assigned to singlets. In the case that both flavon fields $\phi_{\text{atm}}$ and $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ transform as triplet $\bm{\bar{3}_{0}}$, only one phenomenologically viable lepton mixing pattern is obtained for normal ordering neutrino masses. The lepton mixing matrix is predicted to be TM1 pattern, with neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP violation phases depending on only three real input parameters. When $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ is assigned to the $\bm{\bar{3}_{1}}$ representation, an additional real parameter $x$ must be included. Then we find 42 independent phenomenologically interesting mixing patterns, and the corresponding predictions for lepton mixing parameters and neutrino masses are obtained. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis for five example breaking patterns with some benchmark values of $x$. The absolute values of the first columns of PMNS matrix are fixed to be $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{17},2,2\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{38}}\left(5,2,3\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{57}}\left(\sqrt{37},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{10}\right)^{T}$ and $\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt{6},1,\sqrt{2}\right)^{T}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Symmetry theta angles and topological Witten effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of $\theta$ angles in quantum field theory that we call symmetry $\theta$ angles. Unlike conventional $\theta$ angles whose definition depends on a choice of a path integral, symmetry $\theta$ angles are intrinsic parameters of a quantum field theory that depend only on its symmetries. A frequent consequence of symmetry $\theta$ angles is a phenomenon we call the topological Witten effect, which is a generalization of the standard Witten effect. Topological Witten effects modify which charged operators are attached to topological operators as a function of $\theta$. Physically, topological Witten effects induce generalized Aharonov-Bohm effects. We show that these new $\theta$ angles and Witten effects can appear in many familiar field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalies give rise to novel transport phenomena, including the generation of a current in a relativistic fluid due to the presence of magnetic field or vorticity. We present an exclusive and direct computation of the chiral anomaly within the path integral for a massless fermion on a generic electromagnetic and curved background, including local temperature and chemical potential. We identify new thermodynamical contributions to the anomaly which induce the Chiral Separation and Vortical Effects. Additionally, we show that the anomaly fully vanishes at global equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Testing T2K's Bayesian constraints with priors in alternate parameterisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian analysis results require a choice of prior distribution. In long-baseline neutrino oscillation physics, the usual parameterisation of the mixing matrix induces a prior that privileges certain neutrino mass and flavour state symmetries. Here we study the effect of privileging alternate symmetries on the results of the T2K experiment. We find that constraints on the level of CP violation (as given by the Jarlskog invariant) are robust under the choices of prior considered in the analysis. On the other hand, the degree of octant preference for the atmospheric angle depends on which symmetry has been privileged.</description>

      <title>On discrete gauging and non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify selection rules of conjugacy classes of several finite discrete groups where we deal with both gauged and ungauged cases. We find that the selection rules enjoy finite Abelian or non-Abelian discrete symmetries originating from the inner and/or outer automorphism of underlying discrete groups. Since the selection rules of conjugacy classes do not obey conventional group-like selection rules, they open up new coupling selection rules of fields which are labeled by the conjugacy classes.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.</description>

      <title>An extended MDI interaction for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights on nuclear double parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address double parton scattering (DPS) in pA collisions. Within the Light-Front approach, we formally derive the two contributions to the nuclear double parton distribution (DPD), namely: DPS1, involving two partons from the same nucleon, and DPS2, where the two partons belong to different parent nucleons. We then generalize the sum rule for hadron DPDs to the nuclear case and analytically show how all contributions combine to give the expected results. In addition partial sum rules for the DPDs related to DPS1 and DPS2 mechanisms are discussed for the first time. The deuteron system is considered for the first calculation of the nuclear DPD by using a realistic wave function obtained from the very refined nucleon-nucleon AV18 potential, embedded in a rigorous Poincar\'e covariant formalism. Results are used to test sum rules and properly verify that DPS1 contribution compares with the DPS2 one, although smaller. We also introduce EMC-like ratios involving nuclear and free DPDs to address the potential role of DPS in understanding in depth the EMC effect.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates in the non-linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a massless perturbative framework for the two dimensional non-linear sigma model (NLSM), that allows the computation of the perturbative series attached to the operator condensates in the operator product expansion (OPE). It is based on a limit of the quartic linear sigma model (LSM) and is manifestly $O(N)$ symmetric. We show, at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$ expansion, how this framework reproduces the perturbative contribution to the two-point function, as well as its first exponentially small correction due to the condensate of the Lagrangian operator, in full agreement with the exact non-perturbative large $N$ solution. We also show that, in the full LSM, the physics at the natural UV cutoff indeed decouples from the NLSM in the IR, in the weak-coupling limit. In particular, we show that the perturbative framework for the LSM at the cutoff scale is connected to the one in the NLSM. The structure of power divergences in the LSM regularization also reveals that the first renormalon on the positive Borel axis of the NLSM perturbative self-energy is an UV renormalon, which cancels against the ambiguity in the condensate.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Axion USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage, inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence $\propto k^m$ with the index $m &gt;4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated in this setup.</description>

Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain fast applicability of hydrodynamics at ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of a universal behaviour across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas dynamics under full theoretical control.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Corrections to Soft Drop Jet Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a quantum field theory based description of the nonperturbative effects from hadronization for soft drop groomed jet mass distributions using the soft-collinear effective theory and the coherent branching formalism. There are two distinct regions of jet mass $m_J$ where grooming modifies hadronization effects. In a region with intermediate $m_J$ an operator expansion can be used, and the leading power corrections are given by three universal nonperturbative parameters that are independent of all kinematic variables and grooming parameters, and only depend on whether the parton initiating the jet is a quark or gluon. The leading power corrections in this region cannot be described by a standard normalized shape function. These power corrections depend on the kinematics of the subjet that stops soft drop through short distance coefficients, which encode a perturbatively calculable dependence on the jet transverse momentum, jet rapidity, and on the soft drop grooming parameters $z_{\rm cut}$ and $\beta$. Determining this dependence requires a resummation of large logarithms, which we carry out at LL order. For smaller $m_J$ there is a nonperturbative region described by a one-dimensional shape function that is unusual because it is not normalized to unity, and has a non-trivial dependence on $\beta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.07821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new dark-matter detection strategy that will potentially enable the search for super-light dark matter $m_\chi \simeq 0.1$ keV, improving the minimum detectable mass by more than three orders of magnitude compared to ongoing experiments. This can be achieved by intimately integrating the target material, specifically the $\pi$-bond electrons in graphene, into a Josephson junction to create a highly sensitive detector capable of detecting energy deposits from dark matter as small as $\sim 0.1$ meV. We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</description>

Abstract: The top quark mass is a key parameter of the Standard Model, yet measuring it precisely at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is challenging. Inspired by the use of standard candles in cosmology, we propose a novel energy correlator-based observable, which directly accesses the dimensionless quantity $m_t$/$m_W$. We perform a Monte Carlo study to demonstrate the feasibility of the top mass extraction from Run 2, 3, and High-Luminosity LHC datasets. Our resulting $m_t$ can be defined in a well-controlled short-distance mass scheme and exhibits remarkably small uncertainties from nonperturbative effects, as well as insensitivity to parton distribution functions, outlining a roadmap for a record precision measurement at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmic Neutrino Background and New Physics with TeV-Scale Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from the most significant astrophysical sources detected by IceCube -- NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, PKS 1424+240 -- to constrain the local and global overdensity of relic neutrinos and to explore potential new neutrino self-interactions. Assuming a relic neutrino overdensity, such high-energy neutrinos have travelled considerable distances through a sea of relic neutrinos and could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to $\eta \leq 2 \times 10^{14}$ at the 90$\%$ confidence level, assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves for larger neutrino masses and study how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region. Considering new interactions between TeV-scale neutrinos and relic neutrinos, mediated by a light boson, we probe couplings of approximately $g \sim 10^{-2}$ with current data for a boson mass around the MeV scale. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Heavy Asymmetric and Symmetric Dark Matter from the Glashow Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can lead to distinct neutrino signatures characterized by an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. In the high-energy regime, the Glashow resonant interaction $\bar{\nu}_{e} + e^{-} \rightarrow W^{-}$ yields an increase in sensitivity to the neutrino flux, and stands out as the only way of discerning the antineutrino component in the diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. This offers a unique opportunity in the search for dark matter with masses above the PeV scale. We examine the neutrino signal stemming from ADM decay and set the first stringent constraints on ADM lifetime $\tau_X$. For ADM with mass $m_X\gtrsim 10$~PeV, we {exclude} $\tau_X\lesssim 10^{29}$s using the data from the recent IceCube search for Glashow resonance events. Our projections further show that sensitivities at the forthcoming IceCube-Gen2 could approach $10^{30}$s, depending on the decay channel. The current constraints on symmetric dark matter decay to neutrinos are also improved by up to a factor of 3 thanks to the Glashow resonance.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicitly gauge-invariant observable of {\em any} general gravitational perturbation, $h_{\mu\nu}$ (\textit{not} necessarily due to gravitational waves (GWs)), in a laser interferometry-based GW detector, identifying the signature as the proper time elapsed of the beamsplitter observer, between two events: when a photon passes through the beamsplitter, and when the same photon returns to the beamsplitter after traveling through the interferometer arm and reflecting off the far mirror. Our formalism applies to simple Michelson interferometers and can be generalized to more advanced setups. We demonstrate that the proper time observable for a plane GW is equivalent to the detector strain commonly used by the GW community, though now the common framework can be easily generalized for other types of signals, such as dark matter clumps or spacetime fluctuations from quantum gravity. We provide a simple recipe for computing the proper time observable for a general metric perturbation in linearized gravity and explicitly show that it is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the perturbation, as any physical observable should be.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. As an application, we identify the subregion that may explain recently reported microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Implication of the existence of $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\bar{D}_sDK$ bound state on nature of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and new configuration of exotic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of numerous new hadrons over the past two decades has provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the non-perturbative QCD and hadron structure. Hadronic molecule picture plays an important role in explaining these new hadrons and enriching the configurations of exotic hadronic states. In this letter, using the model-independent $DK$ potential extracted from the relevant experimental data, a $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\bar{D}_sDK$ three-body hadronic molecule is predicted with a mass of $4310^{+14}_{-24}$ MeV. This state shows decoupling to conventional $c\bar{c}$ charmonia or the $\bar{D}_s D_{s0}^*(2317)$ two-body molecular state. It can be regarded as a compelling three-body hadronic molecular candidate. We further demonstrate that the $B^+ \to {D}^{*\pm}D^\mp K^+$ decays could be promising channels for searching for the predicted state in future high-luminosity LHCb runs.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the nucleon from the generalized parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton's internal structure is characterized not only by its charge and magnetic distribution but also by its mechanical and mass properties, which are encoded in the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These properties provide insights into the spatial distributions of energy, pressure, and shear forces within the proton. Understanding the proton's internal structure, including properties such as its mechanical and mass radii, is essential for unraveling the complex interplay between quarks and gluons that govern its stability and dynamics. In this study, we investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton, particularly the D-term, which encodes key information about the internal stress distribution, pressure, and shear forces within the nucleon. Using a model for skewness-dependent generalized parton distributions constructed from the double-distribution representation, we extract the quark contribution to the $ D(t) $ GFF of the EMT by analyzing available data on Compton form factors. We then employ this extracted GFF to explore the mechanical properties of the proton, including its mechanical and mass radii, as well as the internal pressure and shear force distributions. Our results provide new insights into the proton's internal structure and contribute to the broader understanding of nucleon properties.</description>

      <title>Rare $W \to B_c + \gamma$ decay up to the NNLO and NLL accuracy in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed theoretical study of the rare radiative decay of the $W$ boson into a $B_c$ meson and an on-shell photon. The decay amplitude is described by two independent form factors, which are calculated up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism. Since the two typical energy scales, the $W$-boson mass $m_W$ and the $B_c$-meson mass $m_{B_c}$, involved in the process are widely separated, large logarithms of $m_W^2/m_{B_c}^2$ present in the NRQCD short-distance coefficients are also resummed to all orders in $\alpha_s$ up to the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, by employing the light-cone factorization approach. Taking into account all these corrections, we then perform a phenomenological exploration of this rare decay. It is found that, relative to the leading-order result, the decay width of the process is reduced by the next-to-leading-order and NNLO corrections, with a net effect of $\sim19\%$ and of $\sim31\%$, respectively. Furthermore, the NLL resummation can considerably alter the fixed-order NRQCD predictions, especially for the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ correction. We also find that the radiative corrections increase the renormalization scale dependence of the branching fraction, which is however significantly reduced by the NLL resummation. The dependence of the branching fraction on the heavy-quark masses $m_{b,c}$ is also investigated, which shows a monotonic decrease (increase) with $m_c$ ($m_b$).</description>

      <title>Unraveling particle dark matter with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We parametrically solve the Boltzmann equations governing freeze-in dark matter (DM) in alternative cosmologies with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a mesh-free method. Through inverse PINNs, using a single DM experimental point -- observed relic density -- we determine the physical attributes of the theory, namely power-law cosmologies, inspired by braneworld scenarios, and particle interaction cross sections. The expansion of the Universe in such alternative cosmologies has been parameterized through a switch-like function reproducing the Hubble law at later times. Without loss of generality, we model more realistically this transition with a smooth function. We predict a distinct pair-wise relationship between power-law exponent and particle interactions: for a given cosmology with negative (positive) exponent, smaller (larger) cross sections are required to reproduce the data. Lastly, via Bayesian methods, we quantify the epistemic uncertainty of theoretical parameters found in inverse problems.</description>

      <title>The ${\phi NN,J/\psi NN,\eta_c NN}$ systems based on HAL QCD interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of bound states and resonances in the ${\phi NN, J/\psi NN, \eta_c NN}$ systems using HAL QCD interactions for ${\phi N, J/\psi N}$, and ${\eta_c N}$. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"odinger equation and find no resonances or bound states in the ${J/\psi NN}$ and ${\eta_c NN}$ systems. We estimate the interaction between charmonium and nuclei, concluding that the $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ is likely to bind with ${}^3\mathrm{H}$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}$, ${}^4\mathrm{He}$, and heavier nuclei. For the $\phi NN$ system, the lattice QCD $\phi N\left({ }^2 S_{1 / 2}\right)$ interaction is absent. We combine the $\phi p$ correlation function analysis and HAL QCD results in Model A. We assume the spin-spin interactions for $J/\psi N$ and $\phi N$ systems are inversely proportional to their masses in Model B. Model A predicts a stronger $\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties. In contrast, these states are very loosely bound in Model B, with binding energies below 1 MeV and an existent probability of about 60\% when parameter uncertainties are considered. In both models, there exist very loosely bound $I(J^P) = 0(2^-)$ three-body states which resemble a $\phi$-d atom with the $\phi$ meson surrounding the deuteron, but their existences are sensitive to parameter uncertainties. No bound states or resonances are found in the isovector $I(J^P) = 1(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ system.</description>

      <title>B0 -&gt; K*0 tau+ tau- Decay: Using Machine Learning to Separate Signal from Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the rare decay B0 -&gt; K*0 tau+ tau-, which is sensitive to potential violations of lepton flavor universality predicted by the Standard Model. A Monte Carlo simulated dataset containing both signal and the dominant background process B0 -&gt; K*0 D+ D- was used to train and evaluate machine learning classifiers. After feature selection and parameter tuning, two supervised models -- Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) -- were trained. Feature engineering was then applied to enhance classification performance. On the test set, the BDT achieved an AUC of 0.912 +/- 0.000 and an F1-score of 0.828 +/- 0.001, while the FCNN reached an AUC of 0.877 +/- 0.000 and an F1-score of 0.799 +/- 0.001. These results demonstrate that both models can robustly separate signal from background in rare decay searches, supporting their application in future LHCb analyses.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra in ${\cal N}=1\, SU(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F=N_c$ and problems with S-confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low energy mass spectra of the direct $SU(N_c)$, $\,N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD theory and its N.Seiberg's dual variant [1], are calculated in sections 2 and 3. It is shown that these two mass spectra are parametrically different, both for equal or unequal small quark masses $m_{Q,i}\neq 0$.
  In [17] the very special non-SUSY lattice $SU(N_c)$ QCD theory with $N_F=N_c$ scalar defective "quarks" was considered by E.Fradkin and S.H.Shenker. The conclusion of [17] was that the transition between the confinement and higgs regimes in this theory is the analytic crossover, not the non-analytic phase transition. And although the theory considered in [17] was very specific, the experience shows that up to now there is a widely spread opinion that this conclusion has general applicability.
  This model used in [17] is criticized in section 5 of this paper as incompatible with and qualitatively different from the standard non-SUSY $SU(N_c)$ $N_F=N_c$ QCD theory with standard scalar quarks $\phi^i_{\beta}$ with all their $2N^2_F$ real degrees of freedom. It is emphasized that this model [17] is really the Stuckelberg $SU(N_c)$ YM-theory with no dynamical electric quarks and with massive all $N_c^2-1$ electric gluons with fixed by hands nonzero masses. There is no genuine confinement in this theory, it stays permanently in the completely higgsed phase only. And this is a reason for a crossover in this theory. While in the theory with standard scalar quarks there is the phase transition between the confinement and higgs phases.
  Besides, in section 5, the arguments presented in [2] by K.Intriligator and N.Seiberg for the standard direct $SU(N_c)$, $N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD in support of the crossover from [17] are criticized as erroneous.
  Besides, in section 5 a qualitative mechanism of confinement in our ordinary (i.e. not SUSY) QCD is proposed.</description>

      <title>Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows, quasinormal modes, graybody factors, and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of black holes (BHs), quasinormal modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and graybody factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state under a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We also examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>
