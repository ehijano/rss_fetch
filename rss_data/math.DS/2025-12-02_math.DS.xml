      <title>Tube Rupture in Aperiodic Nonlinear Oscillators: Theory and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term behaviour of the nonlinear, aperiodically and parametrically forced oscillator
  z'' + z + g(tau) z^2 = 0, g(tau) = y(tau)^(-5/2),
  where y(tau) is the strictly positive solution of a weakly forced third-order equation. Building on the algebraic invariant constructed in our previous work, we show that the motion of z(tau) is confined to a two-dimensional invariant tube in the extended phase space (z, p, tau) as long as the corresponding invariant level set remains closed.
  The main result of this paper is an explicit analytical rupture criterion that predicts the precise time at which the invariant tube loses regularity. After transforming the invariant into polar coordinates and analysing the discriminant of the resulting cubic equation for the radial coordinate, we obtain a compact Cardano-type expression for the rupture time. Direct numerical integrations of the z-equation confirm the analytical prediction to within a few percent over a wide parameter range.
  The results establish the rupture time as a robust and quantitatively accurate indicator for the onset of unbounded behaviour in aperiodically and parametrically forced nonlinear oscillators. The method is based purely on algebraic properties of the invariant and remains valid throughout the asymptotic domain of the perturbative expansion for y(tau).
  Keywords: nonlinear oscillators; aperiodic forcing; invariant surfaces; tube integrability; rupture time; Cardano discriminant; secular perturbation; nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Could society itself spiral into a Lorenz-like chaos when facing an epidemic threat?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how societies react to epidemic threats requires more than tracking infection curves. Public perception, collective memory and behavioural adaptation interact through feedback loops that can amplify or suppress the spread of fear, vigilance and precaution. In this work we reinterpret the classical Lorenz system in a socioepidemic context, governed by nonlinear interactions between perceived infection, social transmission behaviour and memory of past risk. We provide a qualitative analysis of the model and show that small fluctuations in perception or behaviour can trigger transitions between stable, oscillatory and chaotic collective responses. These results suggest that social reactions to epidemics may evolve according to intrinsic dynamical rules, generating complex patterns of vigilance, fatigue and renewed concern that mirror the irregular rhythms observed in real outbreaks. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating behavioural feedbacks into epidemic modeling and reveal how chaotic dynamics may arise not only from pathogens but from society itself.</description>

      <title>The fibered rotation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit formula for an increment of the fibered rotation number of a one-parameter family of circle cocycles over any ergodic transformation in terms of invariant measures. As an application, for a family of random dynamical systems on the circle, this gives a formula for an increment of the rotation number in terms of the stationary measures. In the case of projective Schr\"odinger cocycles associated with the Anderson Model, that provides a relation between the properties of the stationary measures on the projective space and the integrated density of states (IDS) of the corresponding family of operators. In particular, it gives a dynamical proof of H\"older regularity of the IDS in Anderson Model. Finally, we prove that the IDS for the Anderson Model with an ergodic background must be H\"older continuous.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics in a reaction-diffusion competition model with edge behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-species competition model in a landscape consisting of a finite number of adjacent patches. For the two-patch scenario, by treating edge behavior at the interface as a strategy, it has been shown that there exists an ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy, which is a globally evolutionarily stable strategy. Specifically, when the resident species follows the IFD strategy and the mutant species does not, the mutant species is unable to invade the resident population. Building on this foundation, our work focuses on exploring the dynamics of the system when neither species can adopt the IFD strategy. We demonstrate that if the strategies of both species either exceed or fall below the IFD strategy, the mutant species can outcompete and eliminate the resident species, provided that its strategy is closer to the IFD strategy and its diffusion rates are equal to or slower than those of the resident species. Furthermore, if the strategies of the two species lie on opposite sides of the IFD strategy, the two species can coexist. This result is further extended to the case of an arbitrary but finite number of patches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a class of quasiregular Latt\`es maps, called orthotopic Latt\`es maps, are cellular Markov maps. This provides examples of expanding Thurston-type maps that are also uniformly quasiregular, and whose visual metrics are quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Riemannian distance.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern induced by cross-diffusion in cancer immunotherapy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a mathematical model describing the interactions between effector cells (E), cancer cells (T), and the IL-2 compound (IL). The model considered here is a generalization, taking into account some cross-diffusion effects, of a spatial cancer immunotherapy model proposed by S. Suddin et al in 2021. These modifications allow us to describe two biologically relevant scenarios: a patient treated with Adoptive Cell Immunotherapy (ACI) and a patient not receiving any treatment/therapy. Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected. We analyze the equilibrium points of the homogeneous system, along with their stability and bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore, adopting the Turing approach for reaction-diffusion systems, we investigate the diffusion-driven instability and the emergence of spatial regular structures (stationary in time), i.e. the patterns. Finally, numerical simulations based on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) are presented for the two previously mentioned scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to characterize in terms of coding a set of limit points considered in a paper of F. Riquelme and A.

Moreover in this particular context we reprove that the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal 1/2 by explicit calculus.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adic Reaction--Diffusion Model of Branching Coral Growth and Calcification Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coral colonies exhibit complex, self-similar branching architectures shaped by biochemical interactions and environmental constraints. To model their growth and calcification dynamics, we propose a novel p-adic reaction-diffusion framework defined over p-adic ultrametric spaces. The model incorporates biologically grounded reactions involving calcium and bicarbonate ions, whose interplay drives the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Nonlocal diffusion is governed by the Vladimirov operator over the p-adic integers, naturally capturing the hierarchical geometry of branching coral structures. Discretization over p-adic balls yields a high-dimensional nonlinear ODE system, which we solve numerically to examine how environmental and kinetic parameters, particularly CO2 concentration, influence morphogenetic outcomes. The resulting simulations reproduce structurally diverse and biologically plausible branching patterns. This approach bridges non-Archimedean analysis with morphogenesis modeling and provides a mathematically rigorous framework for investigating hierarchical structure formation in developmental biology.</description>

      <title>Uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent nonautonomous 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise and subject to almost periodic external forcing. Owing to the distribution-dependent structure and the almost periodicity of the external forcing, the resulting solution process becomes an inhomogeneous Markov process, presenting significant analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we propose sufficient conditions on the time-dependent external forcing and distribution-dependent nonlinear terms, and develop novel analytical estimates. As a result, we establish the existence and uniqueness of uniform measure attractors for the system. Notably, the joint continuity of the family of processes is achieved without relying on the Feller property of $\{P^{(g,h)}{(\tau,t)}\}_{\tau\leq t}$.</description>

      <title>Global Rigidity of Codimension One Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a smooth, locally free, codimension-one action of a higher-rank, simple, split Lie group $G$ on a closed manifold $M$. Let $P$ be a minimal parabolic subgroup of $G$. If the action admits a $P$-invariant probability measure that is mixing, then the action is either equivariantly diffeomorphic to the suspension of a codimension one, locally free action on a closed manifold of a parabolic subgroup of $G$; or, it is finitely and equivariantly covered by the action of $G$ on $G/\Gamma\times S^1$, where the action on $G/\Gamma$ is the coset action, and $G$ acts trivially on $S^1$. We prove this by doing a jointly integration argument of stable and center unstable Pesin manifolds. This is a smooth version of results by Nevo and Zimmer.</description>

      <title>The Coupling Strength Is a Scale Parameter in Threshold Power-Law Reservoirs and Does Not Influence Training Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, the coupling strength of the initial untrained recurrent neural network (the reservoir) is an important hyperparameter that can be varied for accurate training. A common heuristic is to set this parameter near the ``edge of chaos", where the untrained reservoir is near the transition to chaotic dynamics, and the chaos can be ``tamed". Here, we investigate how the overall connectivity strength should be varied in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks, where the firing rate is 0 below some threshold of the current and is a power function of the current above this threshold. These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.</description>

      <title>Contraction Mapping: Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While exploring dynamical systems, we often come across the principle of contraction mapping, or better known as the Banach fixed point theorem. It is an essential concept based on succes- sive approximations, whose utility comes from two main guarantees: establishing existence and uniqueness of a solution, and establishing constructive proof. The intent of this manuscript is to break down two major proofs incorporating this in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and make them a little more understandable step-by-step to an audience that presumably has adequate knowledge of modern calculus and real analysis. These are not original proofs, only original narration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical Teichm\"uller space ${\mathcal T}(U,f)$ associated to a wandering domain $U$ of an entire function $f$. We show that a discrete grand orbit relation in $U$ forces ${\mathcal T}(U,f)$ to be infinite dimensional, thereby answering a question of Fagella--Henriksen. We further describe the geometry of these spaces by developing normal forms for the dynamics on wandering domains, yielding global linearising coordinates in the discrete case and power-type dynamics between annuli in the indiscrete case.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Normality for Dynamically Generated Cantor Series Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of normality for base $g$ expansions of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is rich and well developed. Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $\beta$-expansions, and L\"uroth series expansions.
  Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\{2,3\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers.
  A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of thermodynamic formalism from the perspective of computable analysis, with a special focus on the computability of equilibrium states. Specifically, we develop two complementary general approaches to verify the computability of equilibrium states for non-uniformly expanding computable dynamical systems. The first approach applies to dynamical systems whose topological pressure functions admit effective approximations and whose measure-theoretic entropy functions are upper semi-continuous. As a concrete application, we establish the computability of the equilibrium states for Misiurewicz-Thurston rational maps with \holder continuous potentials. The second approach exploits prescribed Jacobians of equilibrium states through a local analysis and applies to settings where the measure-theoretic entropy functions may lack upper semi-continuity.</description>

Abstract: We develop the nonuniformly hyperbolic theory for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms admitting continuous invariant splitting without domination. This framework includes stable manifold theorems, shadowing and closing lemmas, the existence of horseshoes and the approximation of Lyapunov exponents. The foundation is a new family of resonance blocks, each arising as the forward limit set of a typical point at carefully chosen resonance times where expansion, contraction and a weak scale-dependent domination coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the equilibrium measures of geodesic flows of closed manifolds without conjugate points which have a visibility universal covering. Specifically, the uniqueness problem for Bowen potentials which are constants on some sets--intersection of horospheres-- and satisfy a weak pressure gap. Moreover, we study some ergodic properties of these measures such as the K-mixing property, weighted equidistribution of closed geodesics, the Gibbs property, large deviations and the entropy density of ergodic measures. Assuming, furthermore continuity of Green bundles, existence of a hyperbolic closed geodesic and a Gromov hyperbolic universal covering we prove that the above potentials always satisfy the weak pressure gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a question of Matui and varations of it on minimal ample groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. We first observe that there are already effective minimal ample transformation groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. These groupoids can even be chosen to be amenable. Then we construct essentially principle ample groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. These are based on the recent twisted topological groupoid construction of Palmer and Wu. In particular our new examples do not arise from transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Mixing asymptotics for time-changes of horocycle flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing-via-shearing is a powerful and versatile method for establishing mixing properties of smooth parabolic flows. In its quantitative form, it provides upper bounds on the decay of correlations for sufficiently smooth observables. Despite its wide applicability, determining the exact rates of mixing for a given smooth parabolic flow remains notoriously difficult. Apart from the classical horocycle flow, no examples are known where polynomial asymptotics, or sharp lower bounds, hold. In this paper, we address this question for smooth time-changes of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic surfaces. Our approach relies on a refined version of the mixing-via-shearing method which leverages on a precise description of the ergodic integrals for horocycle flows, in particular of the regularity of the coefficients appearing in their asymptotic expansions. Using this method, we prove polynomial upper bounds on the decay of correlations for smooth observables that match the optimal rates originally obtained by Ratner for the standard horocycle flow. Furthermore, in the presence of a spectral gap below $1/4$, we establish exact polynomial asymptotics, mirroring the classical behavior of the horocycle flow.</description>

Abstract: To a singular foliation on the plane corresponds a circular boundary at infinity endowed with a pre-lamination on the circle. We solve the converse direction. We determine which pre-lamination on the circle are boundary at infinity of a foliation, and we build the corresponding (unique) foliation. We consider both regular foliations and a singular foliations with prong singularities.</description>

      <title>Action de groupe sur la compactification hybride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ be an algebraic group acting on $X$ whose action is closed. J. Poineau defined a compactification $X^\urcorner$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ by using hybrid Berkovich spaces. We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the nondegenerate C^4 hypersurfaces M in R^n, we characterize the rational quadrics as the hypersurfaces that are the least well approximated by rational points. Given M other than a rational quadric, we prove a heuristically sharp lower bound for the number of rational points very near M, improving the sensitivity of prior results of Beresnevich and Huang.
  Our methods are dynamical, and rely on an application of Ratner's theorems to 1-parameter unipotent subgroups U of SL_n(R) such that u - Id has rank at most 2 for every u in U. As part of our work, we study the algebraic subgroups of SL_n(Q) whose collection of real points can contain such a subgroup.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Criterion for Singular or Nonsingular of Diagonally Dominant Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining whether a diagonally dominant matrix is singular or nonsingular is a classical topic in matrix theory. This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions for the singularity or nonsingularity of diagonally dominant matrices. Starting from Taussky's theorem, we establish a unified line of theory which reduces the general problem to the study of irreducible diagonally dominant matrices. A complete similarity and unitary similarity analysis is given for singular irreducible diagonally dominant matrices, leading to a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of an angle equation system associated with the nonzero off-diagonal entries. Applications and motivations from network dynamical systems, affine multi-agent systems, and Kolmogorov differential equations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for the Formation of Large Animal Groups: Topological Coordination, Subgroup Merging, and Velocity Inheritance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete.
  The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group.
  When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks.
  The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.</description>

      <title>Upper Approximation Bounds for Neural Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural oscillators, originating from the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), have demonstrated competitive performance in stably learning causal mappings between long-term sequences or continuous temporal functions. However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of Feedback Integrators introduced by D. E. Chang in 2016. Feedback integrators allow for numerically integrating dynamical systems on manifold while preserving the first integrals of the system. However, its performance was stated and proved in an asymptotic manner, which left a gap between its empirical success and theoretical understandings. In response, we prove preservation of first integrals over entire integration region up to arbitrarily small deviation under Feedback Integrator framework. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive gain selection scheme that significantly improves the performance. Numerical demonstrations are conducted on free rigid body motion in SO(3), the Kepler problem, and a perturbed Kepler problem with rotational symmetry. All demonstration codes are available at: https://github.com/johnbae1901/Feedback-Integrator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>First order endotactic reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction networks are a general framework widely used in modeling diverse phenomena in different science disciplines. The dynamical process of a reaction network endowed with mass-action kinetics is a mass-action system as an ODE defined by a directed graph, the so-called ``reaction graph''. Endotacticity is a graph property used to study persistence and permanence of mass-action systems. In this paper, we provide a detailed characterization of first order endotactic reaction graphs. Besides, we provide a sufficient condition for endotacticity of reaction networks which are not necessarily of first order.
  Such a characterization of a first order endotactic reaction graph yields the spectral property of the adjacency matrix of the reaction graph. As a consequence, we prove that every first order endotactic mass-action system as a linear ODE has a weakly reversible deficiency zero realization, and has a unique equilibrium which is exponentially globally asymptotically stable (and is positive) in each (positive) stoichiometric compatibility class. Using a stability result for asymptotically autonomous differential equations, examples are constructed to illustrate that the global stability results can be extended to mass-action systems of higher order reaction networks modeled by nonlinear ODEs, which are not necessarily endotactic. Different from the classical approaches for proving global asymptotic stability, the proof does not rely on the construction of a Lyapunov function. This paper may serve as a starting point of characterizing endotactic reaction graphs of higher orders and studying global stability of mass-action systems in general.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of the angle between Oseledets spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the angles between Oseledets subspaces and their log-integrability, focusing on dimension $2$. For random i.i.d. products of matrices, we construct examples of probability measures on $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ with finite first moment where the Oseledets angle is not log-integrable. We also show that for probability measures with finite second moment the angle is always log-integrable. We then consider general measurable $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-cocycles over an arbitrary ergodic automorphism of a non-atomic Lebesgue space, proving that no integrability condition on the matrix distribution ensures log-integrability of the angle. In fact, the joint distribution of the Oseledets spaces can be chosen arbitrarily. A similar flexibility result for bounded cocycles holds under an unavoidable technical restriction.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a complete characterization of \emph{topologically exact patterns} on \emph{triods}. Based on their \emph{rotation number} $\rho$, these \emph{exact patterns} are grouped into three classes: \emph{slow} ($\rho &lt; \frac{1}{3}$), \emph{fast} ($\rho &gt; \frac{1}{3}$) and \emph{ternary} ($\rho = \frac{1}{3}$). For each category, we derive a \emph{linear ordering} of the set of natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$ that captures \emph{forcing} between the \emph{patterns}. We also show that each of these orderings is \emph{stable} under perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Given a hyperbolic inner function $f \colon \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D}$ with Denjoy-Wolff point $p \in \partial \mathbb{D}$, it is well known that almost every point $\xi\in \partial \mathbb{D}$ converges to $p$ under iteration of the radial extension $f^* \colon \partial \mathbb{D} \to \partial \mathbb{D}$. We provide explicit bounds for the rate of this convergence in terms of the angular derivative, holding almost surely. Our results also cover the case where the Denjoy-Wolff point is a singularity.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the geometry and topology of leaves of the isoperiodic foliation of the stratum $\Omega\mathcal{M}_1(1,1,-2)$. We prove that each leaf is a surface of infinite genus homeomorphic to the Loch Ness monster surface and supports a singular Euclidean structure whose singularities correspond to isoperiodic forms in the lower stratum $\Omega\mathcal{M}_1(2,-2)$. Along the way we also characterize the possible groups arising as the Veech group of a leaf and give a description of the large-scale conformal geometry of the wall-and-chamber decomposition of the leaves.</description>

      <title>Map enumeration from a dynamical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution summarizes recent work of the authors that combines methods from dynamical systems theory (discrete Painlev\'e equations) and asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomial recurrences, to address long-standing questions in map enumeration. Given a genus $g$, we present a framework that provides the generating function for the number of maps that can be realized on a surface of that genus. In the case of 4-valent maps, our methodology leads to explicit expressions for map counts. For general even or mixed valence, the number of vertices of the map specifies the relevant order of the derivatives of the generating function that needs to be considered. Beyond summarizing our own results, we provide context for the program highlighted in this article through a brief review of the literature describing advances in map enumeration. In addition, we discuss open problems and challenges related to this fascinating area of research that stands at the intersection of statistical physics, random matrices, orthogonal polynomials, and discrete dynamical systems theory.</description>

Abstract: We compare quasi-graphs and generalized $\sin(1/x)$-type continua, which are two classes of continua that generalize topological graphs and contain the Warsaw circle as a nontrivial common element. We show that neither class is a subset of the other, provide some characterizations, and present illustrative examples. We unify both approaches by considering the class of tranched graphs, compare it to concepts known from the literature, and describe how the topological structure of its elements restricts possible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs): deep neural networks (DNNs) architectures motivated by fixed-point iteration schemes for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) of the second kind. We also show how the proposed framework can be used for the solution of inverse problems. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural notion of constant curvature Lorentzian surfaces with conical singularities, and provide a large class of examples of such structures. We moreover initiate the study of their global rigidity, by proving that de-Sitter tori with a single singularity of a fixed angle are determined by the topological equivalence class of their lightlike bi-foliation. While this is reminiscent of Troyanov's uniformization results on Riemannian surfaces with conical singularities, the rigidity will come from topological dynamics in the Lorentzian case.</description>

Abstract: We construct bulk-deformed orbifold Hamiltonian Floer theory for a global quotient orbifold, that is the quotient of a smooth closed symplectic manifold by a finite group acting faithfully via symplectomorphisms. The moduli spaces define an `ordered marked Flow category', which we equip with a coherent presentation via derived orbifolds. The global charts for orbifold Floer cylinders are built from moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in a quotient of projective space by a free action of the given finite group.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinear transformations - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or complex real-world data. Furthermore, these methods also exhibit poor scalability in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during optimization. We propose a data-adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike standard NVAR and RC models, the MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities, while preserving a simple readout structure and improving scalability. Initial experiments across multiple chaotic systems, tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions, showed that the adaptive model outperformed in predictive accuracy the standard NVAR, a leaky echo state network (ESN) - the most common RC model - and a hybrid ESN, thereby showing robust forecasting under noisy conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the regularization problem for port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems by proportional and/or derivative output feedback. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given, which guarantee that there exist output feedbacks such that the closed-loop system is regular, has index at most one, and is still port-Hamiltonian with desired rank properties. All results are derived based on condensed forms, computations of these condensed form can be implemented using only orthogonal transformations and hence are numerically reliable.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $\Phi: X \dashrightarrow X$ is a dominant rational self-map of a projective surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with a regular and non-invertible iterate $\Phi^n$, then we can take $n \leq 12$. This bound is sharp and realized on $X = \mathbb{P}^2$. In the case where $\Phi$ is a birational self-map of $\mathbb{P}^2$ we prove that as long as $\Phi$ does not preserve a non-constant fibration, if some iterate $\Phi^n$ is regular then $\Phi$ itself must be regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal control problem for a control-affine system, where we want to minimize the $L^1$ norm of the control. First, we show how Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to this problem and we divide the extremal trajectories into two categories: regular and singular extremals. Then, we obtain a strong generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition for singular extremals and we show that this condition together with the absence of conjugate points is sufficient to ensure local strong optimality. We provide also some geometric examples where we apply our results. Finally, we prove that generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition is necessary for optimality.</description>

Abstract: Branching Rauzy induction is a two-sided form of Rauzy induction that acts on regular interval exchange transformations (IETs). We introduce an extended form of branching Rauzy induction that applies to arbitrary standard IETs, including non-minimal ones. The procedure generalizes the branching Rauzy method with two induction steps, merging and splitting, to handle equal-length cuts and invariant components respectively. As an application, we show, via a stepwise morphic argument, that all return words in the language of an arbitrary IET cluster in the Burrows-Wheeler sense.</description>
