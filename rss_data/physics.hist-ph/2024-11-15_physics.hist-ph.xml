      <title>Tsung-Dao Lee has died, long live parity symmetry breaking!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On August 4 this year, Tsung-Dao Lee, a renowned theoretical physicist of Chinese origin, passed away at the age of 97. His most famous discovery dates back to 1956, when -- together with Chen-Ning Yang -- he postulated that parity symmetry might be broken by the weak interaction. They suggested experimental tests of this revolutionary idea, which were conducted within one year. The results confirmed the conjecture by Lee and Yang, thus changing a core paradigm of physics.</description>

      <title>Carl Wirtz' article from 1924 in Astronomische Nachrichten on the radial motions of spiral nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the year 1924, a paper by Carl Wirtz appeared in Astronomische Nachrichten, entitled 'De Sitter's cosmology and the radial motion of spiral galaxies'. This paper and its author remained largely unnoticed by the community, but it seems to be the first cosmological interpretation of the redshift of galaxies as a time dilation effect and the expansion of the Universe. Edwin Hubble knew Wirtz' publications quite well. The modern reader would find Wirtz' own understanding diffuse and contradictory in some aspects, but that reflected the early literature on nebulae, to which he himself made important contributions. The 100th anniversary provides a good opportunity to present an English transcription to the community, which can be found in the appendix. This anniversary also provokes to ask for the present status of cosmology which many authors see in a crisis. From an observational viewpoint it shall be illustrated that until today there is no consistent/convincing understanding of how the Universe evolved.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Boundaries and Quantum Uncertainty: What Local Observers Can (Not) Predict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of quantum theory's salient features is its apparent indeterminism, i.e. measurement outcomes are typically probabilistic. We formally define and address whether this uncertainty is unavoidable or whether post-quantum theories can offer a predictive advantage while conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining three aspects: predictive advantage, no-signalling, and reliable intersubjectivity between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive advantage. However, we uncover a fascinating possibility: When the assumption of reliable intersubjectivity between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can, in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

      <title>Timekeeping at Akhet Khufu, as shown by the Diary of Merer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the Diary of Merer (papyri Wadi al-Jarf) allows us to see the Egyptian calendar applied in a logbook. The diary is dated to the 26th year of reign of Khufu and describes Merer and his crew transporting the limestone blocks from the Tura quarries to Akhet Khufu, that is, the pyramid of Khufu (Old Kingdom). We find a calendar with 30-day months, 10-day weeks, five epagomenal days (Tallet, 2017) and Merer's job adapted to the seasons of the year. Seasons and epagomenal days have names according to inscriptions on the east wall of the Tehne tomb of Nj-k'-'nh (Nikaiankh), end of Fourth Dynasty or early Fifth Dynasty. The Diary gives us an overall impression of extreme modernity in the logistics of ancient Egypt. And Merer looks like a person with a reputation for good timekeeping at Akhet Khufu.</description>
