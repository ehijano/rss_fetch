      <title>Stability in Graphs with Matroid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following Independent Stable Set problem. Let G be an undirected graph and M = (V(G),I) be a matroid whose elements are the vertices of G. For an integer k\geq 1, the task is to decide whether G contains a set S\subseteq V(G) of size at least k which is independent (stable) in G and independent in M. This problem generalizes several well-studied algorithmic problems, including Rainbow Independent Set, Rainbow Matching, and Bipartite Matching with Separation. We show that
  - When the matroid M is represented by the independence oracle, then for any computable function f, no algorithm can solve Independent Stable Set using f(k)n^{o(k)} calls to the oracle.
  - On the other hand, when the graph G is of degeneracy d, then the problem is solvable in time O((d+1)^kn), and hence is FPT parameterized by d+k. Moreover, when the degeneracy d is a constant (which is not a part of the input), the problem admits a kernel polynomial in k. More precisely, we prove that for every integer d\geq 0, the problem admits a kernelization algorithm that in time n^{O(d)} outputs an equivalent framework with a graph on dk^{O(d)} vertices. A lower bound complements this when d is part of the input: Independent Stable Set does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k+d unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly. This lower bound holds even when M is a partition matroid.
  - Another set of results concerns the scenario when the graph G is chordal. In this case, our computational lower bound excludes an FPT algorithm when the input matroid is given by its independence oracle. However, we demonstrate that Independent Stable Set can be solved in 2^{O(k)}||M||^{O(1)} time when M is a linear matroid given by its representation. In the same setting, Independent Stable Set does not have a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k unless NP\subseteq coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Directed Acyclic Outerplanar Graphs Have Constant Stack Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stack number of a directed acyclic graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which there is a topological ordering of $G$ and a $k$-coloring of the edges such that no two edges of the same color cross, i.e., have alternating endpoints along the topological ordering. We prove that the stack number of directed acyclic outerplanar graphs is bounded by a constant, which gives a positive answer to a conjecture by Heath, Pemmaraju and Trenk [SIAM J. Computing, 1999]. As an immediate consequence, this shows that all upward outerplanar graphs have constant stack number, answering a question by Bhore et al. [Eur. J. Comb., 2023] and thereby making significant progress towards the problem for general upward planar graphs originating from Nowakowski and Parker [Order, 1989]. As our main tool we develop the novel technique of directed $H$-partitions, which might be of independent interest. We complement the bounded stack number for directed acyclic outerplanar graphs by constructing a family of directed acyclic 2-trees that have unbounded stack number, thereby refuting a conjecture by N\"ollenburg and Pupyrev [GD 2023].</description>

      <title>Difference of Submodular Minimization via DC Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem. Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications: speech corpus selection and feature selection.</description>

      <title>Note on k-Planar and Min-k-Planar Drawings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The k-planar graphs, which are (usually with small values of k such as 1, 2, 3) subject to recent intense research, admit a drawing in which edges are allowed to cross, but each one edge is allowed to carry at most k crossings. In recently introduced [Binucci et al., GD 2023] min-k-planar drawings of graphs, edges may possibly carry more than k crossings, but in any two crossing edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In both concepts, one may consider general drawings or a popular restricted concept of drawings called simple (sometimes also `good'). In a simple drawing, every two edges are allowed to cross at most once, and any two edges which share a vertex are forbidden to cross. While, regarding the former concept, it is for k&lt;=3 known (but not widely known) that every general k-planar graph admits a simple k-planar drawing and this ceases to be true for any k&gt;=4, the difference between general and simple drawings in the latter concept is more striking. We prove that graphs with a min-k-planar drawing but no simple min-k-planar drawing exist for every k&gt;=2, and for every k&gt;=3 there even is a graph with a min-3-planar drawing but no simple min-k-planar drawing.</description>
