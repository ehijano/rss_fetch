      <title>Computation of the Hilbert Series for the Support-Minors Modeling of the MinRank Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MinRank problem is a simple linear algebra problem: given matrices with coefficients in a field, find a non trivial linear combination of the matrices that has a small rank. There are several algebraic modeling of the problem. The main ones are: the Kipnis-Shamir modeling, the Minors modeling and the Support-Minors modeling. The Minors modeling has been studied by Faug\`ere et al. in 2010, where the authors provide an analysis of the complexity of computing a Gr\"obner basis of the modeling, through the computation of the exact Hilbert Series for a generic instance. For the Support-Minors modeling, the first terms of the Hilbert Series are given by Bardet et al. in 2020 based on an heuristic and experimental work. In this work, we provide a formula and a proof for the complete Hilbert Series of the Support Minors modeling for generic instances. This is done by adapting well known results on determinantal ideals to an ideal generated by a particular subset of the set of all minors of a matrix of variables. We then show that this ideal is generated by  a particular subset of the set of all minors of a matrix of variables. We then show that this ideal is generated by standard monomials having a particular shape, and derive the Hilbert Series by counting the number of such standard monomials. Following the work done for the Minors Modeling, we then transfer the properties of this particular determinantal ideal to ideals generated by the Support Minors system, by adding generic forms. This work allows to make a precise comparison between the Minors and Support Minors modeling, and a precise estimate of the complexity of solving MinRank instances for the parameters of the Mirath signature scheme that is currently at the second round of the NIST standardization process for Additional Digital Signature Schemes.</description>

      <title>Reduction systems and degree bounds for integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In symbolic integration, the Risch--Norman algorithm aims to find closed forms of elementary integrals over differential fields by an ansatz for the integral, which usually is based on heuristic degree bounds. Norman presented an approach that avoids degree bounds and only relies on the completion of reduction systems. We give a formalization of his approach and we develop a refined completion process, which terminates in more instances. In some situations when the completion process does not terminate, one can detect patterns allowing to still describe infinite reduction systems that are complete. We present such infinite systems for the fields generated by Airy functions and complete elliptic integrals, respectively. Moreover, we show how complete reduction systems can be used to find rigorous degree bounds. In particular, we give a general formula for weighted degree bounds and we apply it to find tight bounds in the above examples.</description>
