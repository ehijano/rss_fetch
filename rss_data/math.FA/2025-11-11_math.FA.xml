      <title>Mean Li-Yorke chaos for a sequence of operators on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the dichotomy for mean equicontinuity and mean sensitivity for a sequence of bounded linear operators from a Banach space to a normed linear space. The mean Li-Yorke chaos for sequences and submultiplicative sequences of bounded linear operators are also studied. Furthermore, several criteria for mean Li-Yorke chaos are established.</description>

      <title>Positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomials are squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish operator-valued versions of the earlier foundational factorization results for noncommutative polynomials due to Helton (Ann.~Math., 2002) and one of the authors (Linear Alg.~Appl., 2001). Specifically, we show that every positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomial $p$ admits a single-square factorization $p=r^{*}r$. An analogous statement holds for operator-valued noncommutative trigonometric polynomials (i.e., operator-valued elements of a free group algebra).
  Our approach follows the now standard sum-of-squares (sos) paradigm but requires new results and constructions tailored to operator coefficients. Assuming a positive $p$ is not sos, Hahn--Banach separation yields a linear functional that is positive on the sos cone and negative on $p$; a Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction then produces a representing tuple $Y$ leading to contradiction since $p$ was assumed positive on $Y$.
  The key technical input is a canonical tuple of self-adjoint operators $A$ and unitaries $U$, respectively, constructed from the left-regular representation on Fock space. We prove that, up to a universal constant, the norms $\|p(A)\|$ and $\|p(U)\|$ bound the operator norm of any positive semidefinite Gram matrix $S$ representing the sos polynomial $p$. As a consequence, the cone of (sums of) squares of polynomials is closed in the weak operator topology. Exploiting this closedness, the GNS construction associates to a separating linear functional a finite-rank positive semidefinite noncommutative Hankel matrix and, on its range, produces the desired tuple $Y$.</description>

      <title>Sharp solution to Koplienko's conjecture on higher order spectral shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f \in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ be such that $\Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty &lt; \infty$. Let $f^{[n]} \in C(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ be the $n$th order divided difference. A special case of our main result states that for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ we have \[ \Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert \lesssim p^\ast p^n \Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty, \] where $p^\ast = p/(p-1)$ is the H\"older conjugate of $p$ and $T_{f^{[n]}}$ is the multilinear Schur multiplier with symbol $f^{[n]}$. In case of the generalized absolute value map $f(\lambda) = \lambda^{n-1} \vert \lambda \vert, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, we show that \[ p^\ast p^{\min(2,n)} \lesssim \Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert. \] This gives optimal asymptotics for the bounds of Schur multipliers of higher order divided differences as $p \searrow 1$ (for any $n$) and as $p \rightarrow \infty$ (at least for $n=1,2$). Our result is new already in case $n = 2$ and there provides a complete solution to the main problem left open in [Invent. Math. 193, No. 3, 501--538 (2013)].</description>

      <title>New aspects of ill-posedness classification in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a seminal paper of professor M. Z. Nashed published in 1987 on classification of ill-posed linear operator equations and distinguishing two types of ill-posedness in Banach and Hilbert spaces, we present, illustrate and justify a new classification scheme in this context. This scheme classifies bounded linear operators mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces with respect to ill-posedness types, including non-injective operators that may have uncomplemented null-spaces. The hybrid case of strictly singular operators the range of which contains a closed infinite-dimensional subspace plays a prominent role there. By a series of new theorems we complement moreover the theory of $\ell^1$-regularization with respect to ill-posedness phenomena and shed some light on the role of weak*-to-weak continuity in the context of $\ell^1$-regularization for operators with uncomplemented null-space.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principles for the Strichartz Fourier transform on the Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish several fundamental uncertainty principles for the Strichartz Fourier transform on the Heisenberg group, including Benedicks' theorem, the Donoho-Stark principle, the local uncertainty principle of Price, and a weak form of Beurling's theorem. The Strichartz Fourier transform, introduced by Thangavelu (2023), provides a scalar-valued analogue of the classical operator-valued Fourier transform on the Heisenberg group. We first prove an analogue of Benedicks' theorem asserting that a nonzero function and its Strichartz Fourier transform cannot both be supported on sets of finite measure. As a consequence, we obtain Nazarov's uncertainty inequality. We then establish the Donoho-Stark principle, providing quantitative bounds on simultaneous concentration in space and frequency, and extend the local uncertainty principle of Price to this framework. Finally, we present a weak form of Beurling's theorem for radial functions on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>The Stieltjes moment problem in Gelfand-Shilov spaces defined by weight sequences in the absence of derivation closedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stieltjes moment problem is studied in a new framework within the general Gelfand-Shilov spaces defined via weight sequences. The novelty consists of allowing for a naturally larger target space for the moment mapping, which sends a function to its sequence of Stieltjes moments. The motivation comes from a recent version of the Borel-Ritt theorem, concerning the surjectivity of the Borel mapping in Carleman-Roumieu ultraholomorphic classes in sectors, whose defining weight sequence is subject to the condition, weaker than derivation closedness, of having shifted moments. The injectivity and surjectivity of the moment mapping in this new setting is studied and, in some cases, characterized. Finally, results are provided for general weight sequences of fast and regular enough growth when the condition of shifted moments fails to hold.</description>

      <title>Symmetries shape the current in ratchets induced by a bi-harmonic force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2029</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Equations describing the evolution of particles, solitons, or localized structures, driven by a zero-average, periodic, external force, and invariant under time reversal and a half-period time shift, exhibit a ratchet current when the driving force breaks these symmetries. The bi-harmonic force $f(t)=\epsilon_1\cos(q \omega t+\phi_1)+\epsilon_2\cos(p\omega t+\phi_2)$ does it for almost any choice of $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, provided $p$ and $q$ are two co-prime integers such that $p+q$ is odd. It has been widely observed, in experiments in Josephson-junctions, photonic crystals, etc., as well as in simulations, that the ratchet current induced by this force has the shape $v\propto\epsilon_1^p\epsilon_2^q\cos(p \phi_{1} - q \phi_{2} + \theta_0)$ for small amplitudes, where $\theta_0$ depends on the damping ($\theta_0=\pi/2$ if there is no damping, and $\theta_0=0$ for overdamped systems). We rigorously prove that this precise shape can be obtained solely from the broken symmetries of the system and is independent of the details of the equation describing the system.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <title>The relative index theorem and a characterization of Fredholm operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the relative index theorem on non-compact manifolds to encompass a wide variety of hypoelliptic differential operators of arbitrary order, demonstrating that the change in index when changing a differential operator locally can be calculated locally. We also show that the notion of invertibility at infinity (and coercive at infinity) is not only sufficient condition for an operator to be Fredholm but also necessary, resulting in a general geometric characterization of Fredholmness. This characterization connects to a model for unbounded \(KK\)-theory which assumes the operator to be Fredholm instead of having (locally) compact resolvent, and thus provides a convenient tool for index theory on non-compact spaces.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Proximal Gradient Methods in the affine-quadratic case: Strong convergence and limit identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works by Bot-Fadili-Nguyen (arXiv:2510.22715) and by Jang-Ryu (arXiv:2510.23513) resolve long-standing iterate convergence questions for accelerated (proximal) gradient methods. In particular, Bot-Fadili-Nguyen prove weak convergence of discrete accelerated gradient descent (AGD) iterates and, crucially, convergence of the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method in the composite setting, with extensions to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In parallel, Jang-Ryu establish point convergence for the continuous-time accelerated flow and for discrete AGD in finite dimensions.
  These results leave open which minimizer is selected by the iterates. We answer this in the affine-quadratic setting: when initialized at the same point, the difference between the proximal gradient (PGM) and APG iterates converges weakly to zero. Consequently, APG converges weakly to the best approximation of the initial point in the solution set. Moreover, under mild assumptions on the parameter sequence, we obtain strong convergence of APG. The result is tight: a two-dimensional example shows that coincidence of the APG and PGM limits is specific to the affine-quadratic regime and does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Multicentric representation of piecewise constant holomorphic functions and Hermite interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multicentric representation of piecewise holomorphic functions one combines Lagrange interpolation at roots of a polynomial $p$ with convergent power series of $p$ as the "coefficients" multiplying the Lagrange basis polynomials. When these power series are truncated one obtains Hermite interpolation polynomials. In this paper we first review different approaches to obtain multicentric representations with emphasis in piecewise constant holomorphic functions. When the polynomial is of degree $d$ and all power series are truncated after $n^{th}$ power, we formally arrive into a Hermite interpolation polynomial of degree $d(n+1)-1$. The natural way to represent Hermite interpolation is to have for each interpolation condition a basis polynomial which in this case leads to $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials. We then consider the numerical accumulation of errors in the different ways to represent and evaluate the Hermite interpolation. In the multicentric representation due to the convergence of the power series, numerical errors stay bounded as $n$ grows. When we assume that the piecewise constant holomorphic function takes the value $1$ in one of the components and vanishes in the other so that the Hermite interpolation agrees with just one basis polynomial, even then the truncated multicentric representation is favorable. In the general case one would take a linear combination of all $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total-variation (TV) functional. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we determine the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>On the $A$-$q$-Numerical Range of Operators in Semi-Hilbertian Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the $A$-$q$-numerical range of an operator within the framework of semi-Hilbertian spaces. Several fundamental properties of the $A$-$q$-numerical range are established, including spectral inclusion results and a disk union formula. Bounds for the $A$-$q$-numerical radius are derived, extending and generalizing previously known results. Finally, the notion of $A$-nilpotent operator is introduced, and it is shown that the $A$-$q$-numerical range of an $A$-nilpotent operator with index $2$ is a disk (open or closed) in the complex plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces, introduced in the 1960s, are derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, making them intermediate spaces of fractional differentiability order. Bessel potential spaces have recently gained attention due to their identification with the Riesz fractional gradient. This paper explores Bessel potential spaces as complex interpolation spaces, providing original proofs of fundamental properties based on abstract interpolation theory. Main results include a direct proof of norm equivalence, continuous embeddings, and the relationship with Gagliardo spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Boundedness of Generalized Fractional Integral Operators in Morrey Spaces and Camapanato Spaces associated with the Dunkl Operator on the Real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17241v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $I_\beta$ $(0 &lt; \beta &lt; 2\alpha + 2 =d_\alpha)$ is bounded from $L^p(\R,d\mu_\alpha)$ to $L^q (\R, d\mu_\alpha)$ when $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{d_\alpha}{\beta}$ and $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{q} = \frac{\beta}{d_\alpha}$. In \cite{spsa} , the authors introduced the generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $T_\rho^\alpha$ and it's modified version $\tilde{T}_\rho^\alpha$ and extended the above boundedness results to the generalized Dunkl-type Morrey spaces and Dunkl-type $BMO_\phi$ spaces. In this paper we investigate the boundedness of generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operators and it's modified version mainly on the Dunkl-type Campanato space.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

      <title>On F-semi-transitive families of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06529v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of disjoint topological transitivity for supercyclicity, in this paper, we introduce the concept of disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitivity. Then we provide sufficient conditions for cosine operator functions generated by adjoints of weighted composition operators to be Furstenberg-semi-transitive on the space of Radon measures on a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. Also, we characterize disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitive compositions of right multipliers and generalized bilateral weighted shifts on the standard Hilbert module over the C*-algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space. As a special case, we consider the case when the corresponding Furstenberg family under consideration is the family of all infinite subsets of the set of natural numbers. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Necessary Aand Sufficient Characterization Of Absolutely Continuous Functions Defined Over Unbounded Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate and find a necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be absolutely continuous over $\mathbb{R}$ (denoted by $AC(\mathbb{R})$) or any unbounded interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . Note that the Lebesgue's Fundamental theorem of Calculus gives us a necessary and sufficient condition\cite{book:B} for a function defined over a closed interval [a,b] to be absolutely continuous ,and the condition is that the derivative of the function should be in $L^1_{loc}([a,b])$. However, we don't have any such sufficient condition on the derivative of a function that is absolutely continuous over unbounded intervals. One necessary condition is that the function must be locally absolutely continuous (denoted by $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$), but it may not be globally absolutely continuous despite being locally absolutely continuous(we give an explicit example of this). \\ The theorem 1 in this paper gives us a necessary and sufficient condition for a function belonging in $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ to belong in $AC(\mathbb{R})$ in terms of its derivative and identifies the space to which the derivative of an $AC(\mathbb{R})$ function must belong to as $L^1_{G}(\mathbb{R})$ (a strict subspace of $L^1(\mathbb{R})$). \\ Moreover, we define a new space of functions called $L^1_{H}(\mathbb{R})$, and in theorem 2 we show that $L^1_G \subset L^1_H$, which helps us to find an easier criteria to check whether a function belonging to $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$, belongs to $AC(\mathbb{R})$ or not. \\ Finally, we provide a Venn diagram to explicitly show the relation of the newly defined spaces $L^1_{G}(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^1_{H}(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spaces $L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$, $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Extension of $p$-compact operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze various consequences in relation to the extension of operators $T:X\to Y$ that are $p$-compact, as well as the extension of operators $T:X\to Y$ whose adjoints $T^*:Y^*\to X^*$ are $p$-compact. In most cases, we discuss these extension properties when the underlying spaces, either domain or codomain, are $P_\lambda$ spaces. We also answer if these extensions are almost norm-preserving in such circumstances where the extension $\widetilde{T}$ of a $T$ exists. It is observed that an operator can often be extended to a larger domain when the codomain is appropriately extended as well. Specific assumptions might enable us to obtain an extension of an operator that maintains the same range. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a Banach space to be $L_1$-predual.</description>

      <title>Norm of the Ces\`aro operator between some spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the exact norm of the Ces\`aro operator $\mathcal{C}$ on the Korenblum space $H^\infty_\alpha$ for $0 &lt; \alpha \leq \frac12$ and on the logarithmically weighted space $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$ for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. Moreover, we compute its norm when acting from $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$ to $H^\infty_\alpha$. Finally, we establish lower and upper bounds for the norm of $\mathcal{C}$ on the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$, and from the Hardy space $H^\infty$ to $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ for $\alpha\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the maximizers for anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequalities. Our method uses the continuity of the supremum function, together with the relation between the supremums of the subcritical and the critical anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequality, which was established by the first and second author(Car. Var. PDEs 62: Article ID 82, 2024), finally, we give some results of existence and symmetry about the maximizers for several anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness and positivity of solutions to a class of delayed transport equations on a network. The material flow is delayed at the vertices and along the edges. The problem is reformulated as an abstract boundary delay equation, and well-posedness is proved by using the Staffans-Weiss theory. We also establish spectral theory for the associated delay operators and provide conditions for the positivity of the semigroup.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic behavior of singular inner functions in Besov and sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of singular inner functions that are cyclic in some Besov-type spaces of analytic functions over the unit disc. Our sufficient condition is stated only in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the underlying measure. Such singular inner functions are cyclic also in the space $\ell^p_A$ of holomorphic functions with coefficients in $\ell^p$. This can only happen for measures that place no mass on any Beurling-Carleson set.</description>

      <title>Helson's conjecture for smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>
