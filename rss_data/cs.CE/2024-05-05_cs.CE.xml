      <title>Investigation on optimal microstructure of dual-phase steel with high strength and ductility by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we developed an inverse analysis framework that proposes a microstructure for dual-phase (DP) steel that exhibits high strength and ductility. The inverse analysis method proposed in this study involves repeated random searches on a model that combines a generative adversarial network (GAN), which generates microstructures, and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which predicts the maximum stress and working limit strain from DP steel microstructures. GAN was trained using images of DP steel microstructures generated by the phase-field method. CNN was trained using images of DP steel microstructures, the maximum stress and the working limit strain calculated by the dislocation-crystal plasticity finite element method. The constructed framework made an efficient search for microstructures possible because of a low-dimensional search space by a latent variable of GAN. The multiple deformation modes were considered in this framework, which allowed the required microstructures to be explored under complex deformation modes. A microstructure with a fine grain size was proposed by using the developed framework.</description>

      <title>A Peer-to-Peer Energy Management Solution for Maximum Social Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart energy communities, prosumers who both generate and consume energy play a crucial role in shaping energy management strategies. These communities use advanced platforms that enable prosumers to actively engage in the local electricity markets by setting and adjusting their own energy prices. Through peer to peer (P2P) energy trading systems, members can directly exchange energy derived from sources such as solar photovoltaic panels, electric vehicle battery storage, and demand response (DR) programs. This direct exchange not only enhances the efficiency of the network but also fosters a dynamic energy market within the community. In this article, parking-sharing services for EVs and the mechanisms of P2P energy scheduling, which facilitates the transfer and communication of power among different energy communities (ECs) are addressed. It focuses on integrating solar power, responsive electrical loads, and electric vehicles (EVs) to optimize both economic returns and social benefits for all participants. The system is designed to ensure that all energy transactions are transparent and beneficial to the proactive consumers involved. Moreover, due to urban traffic conditions and the challenges of finding suitable locations for EV charging and parking, houses in these communities provide parking-sharing services for EVs. This integration of energy management and urban scheduling illustrates a holistic approach to addressing both energy and transportation challenges, ultimately leading to more sustainable urban environments.</description>

      <title>Introducing a microstructure-embedded autoencoder approach for reconstructing high-resolution solution field from reduced parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel multi-fidelity deep learning approach that transforms low-fidelity solution maps into high-fidelity ones by incorporating parametric space information into a standard autoencoder architecture. It is shown that, due to the integration of parametric space data, this method requires significantly less training data to achieve effective performance in predicting high-fidelity solution from the low-fidelity one. In this study, our focus is on a 2D steady-state heat transfer analysis in highly heterogeneous materials microstructure, where the spatial distribution of heat conductivity coefficients for two distinct materials is condensed. Subsequently, the boundary value problem is solved on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network. Afterward, the calculated low-fidelity result is upscaled using the newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. We then compare the outcomes of developed algorithm with the corresponding finite element results, standard U-Net architecture as well as other upscaling approaches such as interpolation functions of varying orders and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). The analysis of the results based on the new approach demonstrates superior performance compared to other approaches in terms of computational cost and error on the test cases. Therefore, as a potential supplement to neural operators networks, our architecture upscales low-fidelity solutions to high-fidelity ones while preserving critical details that are often lost in conventional upscaling methods, especially at sharp interfaces, such as those encountered with interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Bike network planning in limited urban space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of cycling infrastructure in urban environments hinders the adoption of cycling as a viable mode for commuting, despite the evident benefits of (e-)bikes as sustainable, efficient, and health-promoting transportation modes. Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes. In this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks, effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach compared to heuristic methods. In particular, the framework provides stakeholders with a range of lane reallocation scenarios, illustrating potential bike network enhancements and their implications for car infrastructure. Crucially, our approach is adaptable to various bikeability and car accessibility evaluation criteria, making our tool a highly flexible and scalable resource for urban planning. This paper presents an advanced decision-support framework that can significantly aid urban planners in making informed decisions on cycling infrastructure development.</description>

      <title>Simulating the economic impact of rationality through reinforcement learning and agent-based modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome some of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium assumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined, not fully rational, behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to justify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the capabilities of ABMs with the introduction of fully rational agents that learn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward function. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by extending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that gradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to maximise profits, allows for a thorough study of the impact of rationality on the economy. We find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for maximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market competition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent policies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously learn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market power and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher degree of rationality in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as measured by total output, depending on the specific rational policy, this can come at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework is general, it allows for stable multi-agent learning, and represents a principled and robust direction to extend existing economic simulators.</description>
