      <title>Edge open packing: further characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. In the introductory paper (Chelladurai et al. (2022)), necessary and sufficient conditions for $\rho_{e}^o(G)=1, 2$ were provided, and the graphs $G$ with $\rho_{e}^o(G)\in \{m-2, m-1, m\}$ were characterized, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$. In this paper, we further characterize the graphs $G$. First, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for $\rho_{e}^o(G)=t$, for any integer $t\geq 3$. Finally, we characterize the graphs with $\rho_{e}^o(G)=m-3$.</description>

      <title>An Improved Bound for the Beck-Fiala Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] conjectured that given a set system $A \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ with degree at most $k$ (i.e., each column of $A$ has at most $k$ non-zeros), its combinatorial discrepancy $\mathsf{disc}(A) := \min_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$ is at most $O(\sqrt{k})$. Previously, the best-known bounds for this conjecture were either $O(k)$, first established by Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981], or $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$, first proved by Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  We give an algorithmic proof of an improved bound of $O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$ whenever $k \geq \log^5 n$, thus matching the Beck-Fiala conjecture up to $O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ for almost the full regime of $k$.</description>

      <title>Testing Quasiperiodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cover (or quasiperiod) of a string $S$ is a shorter string $C$ such that every position of $S$ is contained in some occurrence of $C$ as a substring. The notion of covers was introduced by Apostolico and Ehrenfeucht over 30 years ago [Theor. Comput. Sci. 1993] and it has received significant attention from the combinatorial pattern matching community. In this note, we show how to efficiently test whether $S$ admits a cover. Our tester can also be translated into a streaming algorithm.</description>

      <title>Thresholds of Queen covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal configurations of Queens on a square chessboard, defined as those covering the maximum number of squares. For a fixed number of Queens, $q$, we prove the existence of two thresholds in board size: a non-attacking threshold beyond which all optimal configurations are pairwise non-attacking, and a stabilizing threshold beyond which the set of optimal configurations becomes constant. Related studies on Queen domination, such as Tarnai and G\'asp\'ar (2007), focus on minimizing the number of Queens needed for full board coverage. Our approach, by contrast, fixes the number of Queens and analyzes optimal cover via a certain loss-function due to {\em internal loss} and {\em decentralization}. We demonstrate how the internal loss can be decomposed in terms of defined concepts, {\em balance} and {\em overlap concentration}. Moreover, by using our results, for sufficiently large board sizes, we find all optimal Queen configurations for all $2\le q\le 9$. And, whenever possible, we relate those solutions in terms of the classical problem of placing $q$ non-attacking Queens on a $q\times q$ board. For example, in case $q=8$, out of the twelve classical fundamental solutions, only three apply here as centralized patterns on large boards. On the other hand, the single classical fundamental solution for $q=6$ is never cover optimal on large boards, even if centralized, but another pattern that fits inside a $q\times (q+1)$ board applies.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of signatures of XOR-CNF's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a CNF formula $\varphi$ with clauses $C_1, \dots, C_m$ over a set of variables $V$, a truth assignment $\mathbf{a} : V \to \{0, 1\}$ generates a binary sequence $\sigma_\varphi(\mathbf{a})=(C_1(\mathbf{a}), \ldots, C_m(\mathbf{a}))$, called a signature of $\varphi$, where $C_i(\mathbf{a})=1$ if clause $C_i$ evaluates to 1 under assignment $\mathbf{a}$, and $C_i(\mathbf{a})=0$ otherwise. Signatures and their associated generation problems have given rise to new yet promising research questions in algorithmic enumeration. In a recent paper, B\'erczi et al. interestingly proved that generating signatures of a CNF is tractable despite the fact that verifying a solution is hard. They also showed the hardness of finding maximal signatures of an arbitrary CNF due to the intractability of satisfiability in general. Their contribution leaves open the problem of efficiently generating maximal signatures for tractable classes of CNFs, i.e., those for which satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time. Stepping into that direction, we completely characterize the complexity of generating all, minimal, and maximal signatures for XOR-CNFs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>
