      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a established relation in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral, we propose to extract the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through quantum simulation of the integrated correlation functions of trapped two-particle systems on quantum computers. The integrated correlation function can be computed by an ancilla-based algorithm proposed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.64.022319}. The proposal is demonstrated with a simple contact interaction fermion model.</description>

      <title>Proper Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density and the pseudoscalar glueball mass in quenched lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density correlator (TCDC) of the gluonic definition by the Wilson flow is analyzed using the matching procedure. The relationship has been established between the proper Wilson flow time for calculating TCDC and the proper Wilson flow time at which the topological charge defined by the gluon fields is closest to an integer. The properties of TCDC defined by the bosonic field are investigated, and the pseudoscalar glueball mass was extracted from the TCDC computed at the proper Wilson flow time. It is further demonstrated that the proper Wilson flow time determined by the matching procedure can be applied to compute the topological susceptibility in the gluonic definition.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decay of vector charmonium from the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating decay parameters in lattice simulations is a computationally demanding problem, requiring several volumes and momenta. We explore an alternative approach, where the transition amplitude can be extracted from the spectral decomposition of particular ratios built from correlation functions. This so-called ratio method has the advantage of not needing various irreducible representations or volumes, and it allows us to predict the decay width $\Gamma$ and the energy shift $\epsilon$ of the spectrum directly. In this work, we apply this method to study the hadronic decay $\psi(3770)\to \bar{D}D$ on two CLS $N_\text{f}=2$ ensembles. This approach requires close to on-shell kinematics to work, and we employ twisted boundary conditions to precisely tune the on-shell point. Although our study is yet to approach the continuum limit, we find a value of $\Gamma$ fully compatible to the physical result, and $\epsilon$ informs us by how much our spectrum would shift in a fully dynamical simulation. Besides lattice calculations, many analytical tools have been proposed to understand decay processes. A relatively simple, early example is the ${}^3P_0$ quark model, which provides a physical insight of the decay process.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <title>Flavor diagonal nucleon charges using clover fermions on MILC HISQ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present lattice results for the flavor diagonal charges of the proton from the analysis of eight ensembles generated using 2+1+1-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) by the MILC collaboration. The calculation includes all the needed connected and disconnected contributions to nucleon three-point function. For extracting matrix elements using fits to the spectral decomposition of these correlation functions, two strategies to remove excited state contributions are employed and compared. To renormalize these charges, the 2+1-flavor mixing matrix is calculated in the RI-sMOM intermediate scheme on the lattice. The final results are presented in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at scale 2GeV. The axial charges for the proton are $g_A^u = 0.781(25)$, $g_A^d = -0.440(39)$, and $g_A^s = -0.055(9)$; the tensor charges are $g_T^u = 0.782(28)$, $g_T^d = -0.195(10)$, and $g_T^s = -0.0016(12)$; and the scalar charges are $g_S^u = 9.39(88)$, $g_S^d = 8.84(93)$, and $g_S^s = 0.37(14)$. Results for the neutron are given by the $u \leftrightarrow d$ interchange. Results for the sigma terms are $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{\rm standard} = 42(6)~{\rm MeV}$ from a "standard" analysis and $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{N \pi} = 61(6)~{\rm MeV}$ from a "$N\pi$" analysis that includes the contributions of multihadron $N\pi $ excited states as motivated by chiral perturbation theory. Our preferred value $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{N \pi}$ is consistent with the phenomenological extraction from $\pi- N$ scattering data. The strangeness content of the proton, for which the "standard" analysis is appropriate, is $\sigma_{s}|_{\rm standard} = 35(13)~{\rm MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We analytically show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>
