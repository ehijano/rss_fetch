      <title>Fractional Spike Differential Equations Neural Network with Efficient Adjoint Parameters Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs, achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely applicable to various real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis of steady states in partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19707v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-fine crack cue for robust crack detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>SpiLiFormer: Enhancing Spiking Transformers with Lateral Inhibition</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Transformers have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance and high energy efficiency. However, the spiking attention modules of most existing Transformer-based SNNs are adapted from those of analog Transformers, failing to fully address the issue of over-allocating attention to irrelevant contexts. To fix this fundamental yet overlooked issue, we propose a Lateral Inhibition-inspired Spiking Transformer (SpiLiFormer). It emulates the brain's lateral inhibition mechanism, guiding the model to enhance attention to relevant tokens while suppressing attention to irrelevant ones. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (+0.45%), CIFAR-100 (+0.48%), CIFAR10-DVS (+2.70%), N-Caltech101 (+1.94%), and ImageNet-1K (+1.6%). Notably, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, SpiLiFormer (69.9M parameters, 4 time steps, 384 resolution) outperforms E-SpikeFormer (173.0M parameters, 8 time steps, 384 resolution), a SOTA spiking Transformer, by 0.46% using only 39% of the parameters and half the time steps. The code and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/KirinZheng/SpiLiFormer.</description>

      <title>A Robust, Open-Source Framework for Spiking Neural Networks on Low-End FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1 spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources. The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking neural networks on toy problems.

      <title>APTx Neuron: A Unified Trainable Neuron Architecture Integrating Activation and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.</description>

      <title>Tournament of Prompts: Evolving LLM Instructions Through Structured Debates and Elo Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.</description>
