      <title>Estimating Social Network Models with Link Misclassification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adjusted 2SLS estimator for social network models when reported binary network links are misclassified (some zeros reported as ones and vice versa) due, e.g., to survey respondents' recall errors, or lapses in data input. We show misclassification adds new sources of correlation between the regressors and errors, which makes all covariates endogenous and invalidates conventional estimators. We resolve these issues by constructing a novel estimator of misclassification rates and using those estimates to both adjust endogenous peer outcomes and construct new instruments for 2SLS estimation. A distinctive feature of our method is that it does not require structural modeling of link formation. Simulation results confirm our adjusted 2SLS estimator corrects the bias from a naive, unadjusted 2SLS estimator which ignores misclassification and uses conventional instruments. We apply our method to study peer effects in household decisions to participate in a microfinance program in Indian villages.</description>

      <title>Forecasting dementia incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper estimates the stochastic process of how dementia incidence evolves over time. We proceed in two steps: first, we estimate a time trend for dementia using a multi-state Cox model. The multi-state model addresses problems of both interval censoring arising from infrequent measurement and also measurement error in dementia. Second, we feed the estimated mean and variance of the time trend into a Kalman filter to infer the population level dementia process. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we find that dementia incidence is no longer declining in England. Furthermore, our forecast is that future incidence remains constant, although there is considerable uncertainty in this forecast. Our two-step estimation procedure has significant computational advantages by combining a multi-state model with a time series method. To account for the short sample that is available for dementia, we derive expressions for the Kalman filter's convergence speed, size, and power to detect changes and conclude our estimator performs well even in short samples.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Bayesian Local Projections: Simultaneous Inference and Extension to the Instrumental Variable Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local projections (LPs) are widely used for impulse response analysis, but Bayesian methods face challenges due to the absence of a likelihood function. Existing approaches rely on pseudo-likelihoods, which often result in poorly calibrated posteriors. We propose a quasi-Bayesian method based on the Laplace-type estimator, where a quasi-likelihood is constructed using a generalized method of moments criterion. This approach avoids strict distributional assumptions, ensures well-calibrated inferences, and supports simultaneous credible bands. Additionally, it can be naturally extended to the instrumental variable method. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Estimation of Multinomial Response Models with Random Consideration Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12470v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in the fitting of unordered multinomial response models for $J$ mutually exclusive categories is that the responses arise from the same set of $J$ categories across subjects. However, when responses measure a choice made by the subject, it is more appropriate to condition the distribution of multinomial responses on a subject-specific consideration set, drawn from the power set of $\{1,2,\ldots,J\}$. This leads to a mixture of multinomial response models governed by a probability distribution over the $J^{\ast} = 2^J -1$ consideration sets. We introduce a novel method for estimating such generalized multinomial response models based on the fundamental result that any mass distribution over $J^{\ast}$ consideration sets can be represented as a mixture of products of $J$ component-specific inclusion-exclusion probabilities. Moreover, under time-invariant consideration sets, the conditional posterior distribution of consideration sets is sparse. These features enable a scalable MCMC algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution of parameters, random effects, and consideration sets. Under regularity conditions, the posterior distributions of the marginal response probabilities and the model parameters satisfy consistency. The methodology is demonstrated in a longitudinal data set on weekly cereal purchases that cover $J = 101$ brands, a dimension substantially beyond the reach of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Improving the Estimation of Lifetime Effects in A/B Testing via Treatment Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing randomized experiments to evaluate the effect of short-term treatments on the short-term outcomes has been well understood and become the golden standard in industrial practice. However, as service systems become increasingly dynamical and personalized, much focus is shifting toward maximizing long-term outcomes, such as customer lifetime value, through lifetime exposure to interventions. Our goal is to assess the impact of treatment and control policies on long-term outcomes from relatively short-term observations, such as those generated by A/B testing. A key managerial observation is that many practical treatments are local, affecting only targeted states while leaving other parts of the policy unchanged. This paper rigorously investigates whether and how such locality can be exploited to improve estimation of long-term effects in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a fundamental model of dynamic systems. We first develop optimal inference techniques for general A/B testing in MDPs and establish corresponding efficiency bounds. We then propose methods to harness the localized structure by sharing information on the non-targeted states. Our new estimator can achieve a linear reduction with the number of test arms for a major part of the variance without sacrificing unbiasedness. It also matches a tighter variance lower bound that accounts for locality. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a broad class of differentiable estimators, which encompasses many widely used approaches in practice. We show that all such estimators can benefit from variance reduction through information sharing without increasing their bias. Together, these results provide both theoretical foundations and practical tools for conducting efficient experiments in dynamic service systems with local treatments.</description>

      <title>Location Characteristics of Conditional Selective Confidence Intervals via Polyhedral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the location properties of a conditional selective confidence interval constructed via the polyhedral method. The interval is derived from the distribution of a test statistic conditional on the event of statistical significance. For a one-sided test, its behavior depends on whether the parameter is highly or only marginally significant. In the highly significant case, the interval closely resembles the conventional confidence interval that ignores selection. By contrast, when the parameter is only marginally significant, the interval may shift far to the left of zero, potentially excluding all a priori plausible parameter values. This "location problem" does not arise if significance is determined by a two-sided test or by a one-sided test with randomized response (e.g., data carving).</description>
