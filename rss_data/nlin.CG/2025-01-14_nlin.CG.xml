      <title>Quantum Circuits for Elementary Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we identify full list of Elementary Cellular Automata rules which can be simulated using a quantum circuit (there are 22 such rules). For every such rule we present quantum circuit implementing it with $O(N)$ gates.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organizing complex systems can be modeled using cellular automaton models. However, the parametrization of these models is crucial and significantly determines the resulting structural pattern. In this research, we introduce and successfully apply a sound statistical method to estimate these parameters. The decisive difference to earlier applications of such approaches is that, in our case, both the CA rules and the resulting patterns are discrete. The method is based on constructing Gaussian likelihoods using characteristics of the structures, such as the mean particle size. We show that our approach is robust for the method parameters, domain size of patterns, or CA iterations.</description>

      <title>Excitation and inhibition imbalance affects dynamical complexity through symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perfect radial symmetries of radiolarian mineral skeletons to the broken symmetry of homochirality, the logic of Nature's regularities has fascinated scientists for centuries. Some of Nature's symmetries are clearly visible in morphology and physical structure, whereas others are hidden in the network of interactions among system components. Just as visible symmetries and asymmetries contribute to the system's beauty, might hidden symmetries contribute to the system's functional harmony? And if so, how? Here we demonstrate that the interaction networks of biological systems from cell signaling to cancer display a form of dynamical reflection symmetry that serves to expand their dynamical complexity. The expansion proceeds according to precise rules regarding the lengths of dynamical cycles, made possible by a peculiar imbalance between excitation and inhibition. To probe the conditions under which this reflection symmetry evolves, we use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to produce networks with long dynamical cycles. We find that local structural motifs that break the reflection symmetry are deleted in the evolutionary process, providing evidence for symmetry's causal role in dynamical complexity. Finally, we identify symmetries in real continuous-valued scRNA-seq data of gene expression in drug-resistant cancer cells. Broadly, our work reveals a class of hidden symmetries in biology, present in the network of interactions among system components, and it underscores their functional importance. Mathematically simple and computational inexpensive, our approach is applicable to the types of biological data commonly acquired in modern experiments.</description>
