      <title>Diffusion Probabilistic Generative Models for Accelerated, in-NICU Permanent Magnet Neonatal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and (4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Correlation: Towards Causal Large Language Model Agents in Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to develop reliable AI partners for biomedical progress.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</description>

      <title>Analysis of clinical, dosimetric and radiomic features for predicting local failure after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastases in malignant melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: This study aimed to predict lesion-specific outcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma (MBM), using clinical, dosimetric pretherapeutic MRI data. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 517 MBM from 130 patients treated with single-fraction or hypofractionated SRT across three centers were analyzed. From contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, 1576 radiomic features (RF) were extracted per lesion - 788 from the gross tumor volume (GTV), 788 from a 3 mm peritumoral margin. Clinical data, radiation dose and RF from one center were used for feature selection and model development via nested cross-validation; external validation was performed using the other two centers. Results: Local failure occurred in 72 of 517 lesions (13.9%). Predictive models based on clinical data (model 1), RF (model 2), or both (model 3) achieved c-indices of 0.60 +/- 0.15, 0.65 +/- 0.11, and 0.65 +/- 0.12. RF-based models outperformed the clinical model, while dosimetric data alone were not predictive. Most predictive RF came from the peritumoral margin (92%) vs. GTV (76%). On the first external dataset, all models performed similarly (c-index: 0.60-0.63), but showed poor generalization on the second (c-index &lt; 0.50), likely due to differences in patient characteristics and imaging protocols. Conclusions: Information extracted from pretherapeutic MRI, particularly from the peritumoral area, can support accurate prediction of lesion-specific outcomes after SRT in MBM. When combined with clinical data, these imaging-derived markers offer valuable prognostic insights. However, generalizability remains challenging by heterogeneity in patient populations and MRI protocols.</description>
