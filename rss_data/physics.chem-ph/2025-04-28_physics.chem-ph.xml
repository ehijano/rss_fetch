      <title>Development of Exotic Harmonium Model to Investigate Electron-Positively Charged Particle Correlation in Two-Component Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of calculating the electron-positively charged particle correlation energy poses a challenge in the field of quantum chemistry beyond the adiabatic approximation. In this study, a toy model called Exotic Harmonium is developed to enhance our understanding of this type of correlation. Since the analytical methods to solve the eigenvalue equation for Exotic Harmonium lead to the excited rather than the ground state of the system, we employ the variation method in this study to obtain an approximate ground state wave function. By considering the asymptotic behavior of the wave function, we derive a compact but highly accurate variational wave function. Using this wave function, we are able to determine various properties of the system, including energy and its components, as well as single-particle densities. Additionally, we extend key concepts and quantities specifically tailored to study electron correlation in the Harmonium model to the Exotic Harmonium model. For instance, the "correlation hill" concept effectively highlights the distinct nature of electron-positively charged particle correlation compared to electron-electron correlation. Furthermore, we utilize Exotic Harmonium to assess the accuracy of five electron-positively charged particle correlation functionals developed within the context of the two-component density functional theory. Through a regression process, we obtained a compact yet precise analytical form for wave function which explicitly depends on the two crucial variables: oscillator field frequency and positively charged particle mass. This analytical form provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system. Also, the Exotic Harmonium model enables the investigation of electron-positively charged particle correlation in a vast range of particle masses.</description>

      <title>Determining Molecular Ground State with Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution using Broken-Symmetry Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, commonly used for approximating molecular ground states, becomes nonideal in open shell systems due to the inherent multi-configurational nature of the wave function, limiting accuracy in Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models to Accelerate Organic Chemistry Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical synthesis, as a foundational methodology in the creation of transformative molecules, exerts substantial influence across diverse sectors from life sciences to materials and energy. Current chemical synthesis practices emphasize laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows, underscoring the urgent need for advanced AI assistants. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs), typified by GPT-4, have been introduced as an efficient tool to facilitate scientific research. Here, we present Chemma, a fully fine-tuned LLM with 1.28 million pairs of Q&amp;A about reactions, as an assistant to accelerate organic chemistry synthesis. Chemma surpasses the best-known results in multiple chemical tasks, e.g., single-step retrosynthesis and yield prediction, which highlights the potential of general AI for organic chemistry. Via predicting yields across the experimental reaction space, Chemma significantly improves the reaction exploration capability of Bayesian optimization. More importantly, integrated in an active learning framework, Chemma exhibits advanced potential for autonomous experimental exploration and optimization in open reaction spaces. For an unreported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of cyclic aminoboronates and aryl halides for the synthesis of $\alpha$-Aryl N-heterocycles, the human-AI collaboration successfully explored suitable ligand and solvent (1,4-dioxane) within only 15 runs, achieving an isolated yield of 67%. These results reveal that, without quantum-chemical calculations, Chemma can comprehend and extract chemical insights from reaction data, in a manner akin to human experts. This work opens avenues for accelerating organic chemistry synthesis with adapted large language models.</description>

      <title>Highly Accurate Expectation Values Using High-Order Relativistic Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the automatic generation of analytic first derivatives of the energy for general coupled-cluster models using the \text{tenpi} toolchain. We report the first implementation of expectation values for CCSDT and CCSDTQ methods within the DIRAC program package for relativistic molecular calculations. As pivotal calculations, we focus on the electric field gradient (EFG) evaluated at the lithium nucleus in LiX (X = H, F, Cl) compounds, enabling the extraction of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment $Q({}^{7}Li)$, and at the aluminum nucleus in AlY (Y =H, F, Cl, Br) compounds, for the determination of $Q({}^{27}Al)$. These high-order methods are applied to compute corrections for triple and quadruple excitations for the EFG, a crucial quantity for determining nuclear quadrupole moments. We obtain $Q({}^{27}Al)$ = 0.1466 b, in excellent agreement with the recommended value, and $Q({}^{7}Li)$ = -0.0386 b, which is smaller than the currently recommended value, that indicates the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear optical probe for cavity-dressed vibrational mode mixing: multidimensional double-quantum coherence and photon-echo signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Single Organic Radicals with Sub-Molecular Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in the magnetism of organic compounds is growing because of new organic magnets, spin-based electronics and the diverse properties of magnetic edge states in graphene nanoribbons. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy combined with the scanning tunneling microscopy has recently been developed as a powerful tool to address individual magnetic atoms and molecules at the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate electron spin resonance and magnetic resonance imaging of all-organic radical anions adsorbed on a protective thin insulating film grown on a metal support. We show that using the highly localized exchange field of the magnetic tip apex allows visualization of the delocalized spin density with sub-molecular resolution, enabling spin-density tomography that can distinguish similar molecular species. These results provide new opportunities for visualizing spin density and magnetic interactions at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Parallelized Givens Ansatz for Molecular ground-states: Bridging Accuracy and Efficiency on NISQ Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most popular algorithms for solving the electronic structure problem on near-term quantum computers. The utility of VQE is often hindered by the limitations of current quantum hardware, including short qubit coherence times and low gate fidelities. These limitations become particularly pronounced when VQE is used along with deep quantum circuits, such as those required by the "Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles" (UCCSD) ansatz, often resulting in significant errors. To address these issues, we propose a low-depth ansatz based on parallelized Givens rotations, which can recover substantial correlation energy while drastically reducing circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts for an arbitrary active space (AS). Also, considering the current hardware architectures with low qubit counts, we introduce a systematic way to select molecular orbitals to define active spaces (ASs) that retain significant electron correlation. We validate our approach by computing bond dissociation profiles of water and strongly correlated systems, such as molecular nitrogen and oxygen, across various ASs. Noiseless simulations using the new ansatz yield ground-state energies comparable to those from the UCCSD ansatz while reducing circuit depth by 50-70%. Moreover, in noisy simulations, our approach achieves energy error rates an order of magnitude lower than that of UCCSD. Considering the efficiency and practical usage of our ansatz, we hope that it becomes a potential choice for performing quantum chemistry calculations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling, Public Dataset and Generative Model for Drug-Protein Dissociation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>
