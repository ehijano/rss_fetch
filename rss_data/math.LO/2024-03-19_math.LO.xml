      <title>Serial Properties, Selector Proofs, and the Provability of Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Hilbert, the consistency of a formal theory T is an infinite series of statements "D is free of contradictions" for each derivation D and a consistency proof is i) an operation that, given D, yields a proof that D is free of contradictions, and ii) a proof that (i) works for all inputs D. Hilbert's two-stage approach to proving consistency naturally generalizes to the notion of a finite proof of a series of sentences in a given theory. Such proofs, which we call selector proofs, have already been tacitly employed in mathematics. Selector proofs of consistency, including Hilbert's epsilon substitution method, do not aim at deriving the G\"odelian consistency formula Con(T) and are thus not precluded by G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem. We give a selector proof of consistency of Peano Arithmetic PA and formalize this proof in PA.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05106v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is the first exploration of proof-theoretic semantics for a substructural logic. It focuses on the base-extension semantics (B-eS) for intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic (IMLL). The starting point is a review of Sandqvist's B-eS for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL), for which we propose an alternative treatment of conjunction that takes the form of the generalized elimination rule for the connective. The resulting semantics is shown to be sound and complete. This motivates our main contribution, a B-eS for IMLL, in which the definitions of the logical constants all take the form of their elimination rule and for which soundness and completeness are established.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for the Logic of Bunched Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, substructural logics are used in applications because of their resource interpretations, and these interpretations often refer to the celebrated number-of-uses reading of their implications. However, despite its prominence, this reading is not at all reflected in the truth-functional semantics of these logics. It is a proof-theoretic interpretation of the logic. Hence, one desires a \emph{proof-theoretic semantics} of such logics in which this reading is naturally expressed. This paper delivers such a semantics for the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), generalizing earlier work on IMLL, which is well-known as a logic of resources with numerous applications to verification and modelling. Specifically, it delivers a base-extension semantics (B-eS) for BI in which resources are \emph{bunches} of atoms that get passed from antecedent to consequent in precisely the expected way.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>$\leq_{SP}$ Can Have Infinitely Many Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.08523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building off of recent results on Keisler's order, we show that consistently, $\leq_{SP}$ has infinitely many classes. In particular, we define the property of $\leq k$-type amalgamation for simple theories, for each $2 \leq k &lt; \omega$. If we let $T_{n, k}$ be the theory of the random $k$-ary, $n$-clique free random hyper-graph, then $T_{n, k}$ has $\leq k-1$-type amalgamation but not $\leq k$-type amalgamation. We show that consistently, if $T$ has $\leq k$-type amalgamation then $T_{k+1, k} \not \leq_{SP} T$, thus producing infinitely many $\leq_{SP}$-classes. The same construction gives a simplified proof of Shelah's theorem that consistently, the maximal $\leq_{SP}$-class is exactly the class of unsimple theories. Finally, we show that consistently, if $T$ has $&lt;\aleph_0$-type amalgamation, then $T \leq_{SP} T_{rg}$, the theory of the random graph.</description>

      <title>Sharply 2-transitive groups of finite Morley rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sharply 2-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank and characteristic 2 splits; a split sharply 2-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank and characteristic different from 2 is the group of affine transformations of an algebraically closed field. In particular, a sharply 2-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank of characteristic 3 is the group of affine transformations of an algebraically closed field of characteristic 3.Without any assumption on Morley rank, a sharply 2-transitive permutation group of characteristic 0 splits if its point stabilizers are virtually abelian.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at the Russell Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.00090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two types of approximation to the paradoxical Russell Set are presented, one approximating it from below, one from above. It is shown that any lower approximation gives rise to a better approximation containing it, and that any upper approximation contains a distinct better approximation. The Russell Paradox is then seen to be the claim that two of these processes of better approximations stop, and at the same set. This suggests that the unrestricted Axiom of Comprehension is, not a coherent intuition worthy of rescue from a mysterious paradox, but simply wishful thinking, a confusion of sets as extensional objects with classes defined by a property.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of Boolean Connexive Logics with syncategorematic negation and modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article we investigate three classes of extended Boolean Connexive Logics. Two of them are extensions of Modal and non-Modal Boolean Connexive Logics with a property of closure under an arbitrary number of negations. The remaining one is an extension of Modal Boolean Connexive Logic with a property of closure under the function of demodalization. In our work we provide a formal presentation of mentioned properties and axiom schemata that allow us to incorporate them into Hilbert-style calculi. The presented axiomatic systems are provided with proofs of soundness, completeness, and decidability. The properties of closure under negation and demodalization are motivated by the syncategorematic view on the connectives of negation and modalities, which is discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank and fields of finite transcendence degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ be the class of torsion-free abelian groups of rank $r$, and let $\operatorname{FD}_r$ be the class of fields of characteristic $0$ and transcendence degree~$r$. We compare these classes using various notions. Considering Scott complexity of the structures in the classes and the complexity of the isomorphism relations on the classes, the classes seem very similar. Hjorth and Thomas showed that the $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ are strictly increasing under Borel reducibility. This is not so for the classes $\operatorname{FD}_r$. Thomas and Velickovic showed that for sufficiently large $r$, the classes $\operatorname{FD}_r$ are equivalent under Borel reducibility. We try to compare the groups with the fields, using Borel reducibility, and also using some effective variants. We give functorial Turing computable embeddings of $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ in $\operatorname{FD}_r$, and of $\operatorname{FD}_r$ in $\operatorname{FD}_{r+1}$. We show that under computable countable reducibility, $\operatorname{TFAb}_1$ lies on top among the classes we are considering. In fact, under computable countable reducibility, isomorphism on $\operatorname{TFAb}_1$ lies on top among equivalence relations that are effective $\Sigma_3$, along with the Vitali equivalence relation on $2^\omega$.</description>

      <title>Completions of Kleene's second model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate completions of partial combinatory algebras (pcas), in particular of Kleene's second model $\mathcal{K}_2$ and generalizations thereof. We consider weak and strong notions of embeddability and completion that have been studied before. By a result of Klop it is known that not every pca has a strong completion. The study of completions of $\mathcal{K}_2$ has as corollaries that weak and strong embeddings are different, and that every countable pca has a weak completion. We then consider generalizations of $\mathcal{K}_2$ for larger cardinals, and use these to show that it is consistent that every pca has a weak completion.</description>
