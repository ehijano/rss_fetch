      <title>Internal Stresses as Origin of the Anomalous Low-Temperature Specific Heat in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a recently developed theory of the nonphononic vibrational density of states (DOS) in glasses to investigate the impact of local frozen-in stresses on the low-temperature specific heat. Using a completely harmonic description we show that the hybridization of the local nonphononic vibrational excitations with the waves leads to a low-frequency DOS, in excess to the Debye one, which varies linearly with frequency up to a certain crossover frequency, and then becomes constant. The actual value of the crossover depends of the ratio between the local stresses and the shear modulus. This excess DOS leads to a low-temperature specific heat with an apparent temperature exponent, which is between one and two, as observed experimentally. We discuss, how these findings may be utilized for the characterisation of glassy materials. We further compare our findings, which only rely on harmonic interactions, with the predictions of other theories, which invoke anharmonic interactions and tunneling for explaining the low-temperature behavior of the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Further testing the validity of generalized heterogeneous-elasticity theory for low-frequency excitations in structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper E. Lerner and E. Bouchbinder,
  Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, L013402 (2025) raised concerns regarding the validity of the theory and the interpretation of the data, presented in our previous study on non-phononic vibrational excitations in glasses,
  W. Schirmacher {\it et al.}, Nature Comm. {\bf 15}, 3107 (2024).
  In that work, we presented evidence suggesting that the commonly observed low-frequency regime of the non-phononic vibrational density of states (DoS) is, in fact, highly dependent on technical aspects of the molecular dynamics simulations employed to compute the DoS. Specifically, we showed that the $\omega^4$ scaling results from the use of a tapering function applied to ensure continuity of the interaction potential at the cutoff distance. In this letter we report further evidence in favor of our previous findings, namely the non-universality of the $\omega^4$ DoS scaling, and the existence of an important class of non-phononic excitations in glasses, which we call defect states, and are induced by frozen-in stresses. These modes can be classified as quasi-localized.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large, dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in graphene under strain fields modeled by Dirac oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a paradigmatic material in condensed matter physics due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. A deep understanding of its thermoelectric transport behavior is crucial for the development of novel nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. In this work, we investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of monolayer graphene subjected to randomly distributed localized strain fields, which locally induce impurity-like perturbations. These strain-induced impurities are modeled via 2D Dirac oscillators, capturing the coupling between pseudorelativistic charge carriers and localized distortions in the lattice. Employing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism, we compute the relaxation time using a scattering approach tailored to the Dirac oscillator potential. From this framework, we derive analytical expressions for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The temperature dependence of the scattering centers density is also investigated. Our results reveal how strain modulates transport coefficients, highlighting the interplay between mechanical deformations and thermoelectric performance in graphene. This study provides a theoretical foundation for strain engineering in thermoelectric graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>

      <title>Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses</title>

Abstract: Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics.Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on time-translation invariant probability distributions for edge trajectories, which we encode in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable, and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the method becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it typically provides highly accurate results even for small bond dimensions $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are determined by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply this approach to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings, as well as the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method provides access to precise temporal correlations, which, in some regimes, would be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle \Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^n$, where $n = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $n$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.</description>
