      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Permutation-Invariant Optimizers for Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in [arXiv:2310.06745] that, upon constraining the system to stay in a balanced state, the Parisi formula for the mean-field Potts model can be written as an optimization problem over permutation-invariant functional order parameters.
  In this paper, we focus on permutation-invariant mean-field spin glass models. After introducing a correction term in the definition of the free energy and without constraining the system, we show that the limit free energy can be written as an optimization problem over permutation-invariant functional order parameters. We also show that for some models this optimization problem admits a unique optimizer. In the case of Ising spins, the correction term can be easily removed, and those results transfer to the uncorrected limit free energy.
  We also derive an upper bound for the limit free energy of some nonconvex permutation-invariant models. This upper bound is expressed as a variational formula and is related to the solution of some Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We show that if no first order phase transition occurs, then this upper bound is equal to the lower bound derived in [arXiv:2010.09114]. We expect that this hypothesis holds at least in the high temperature regime.
  Our method relies on the fact that the free energy of any convex mean-field spin glass model can be interpreted as the strong solution of some Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Some conditional FKG inequalities for Markov chains and random processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is interested in proving correlation inequalities of the FKG-type for a broad range of random processes. The two pivotal tools which yield these correlation inequalities are that many discrete-time Markov chains, even under a very general conditioning, satisfy the FKG inequality, and that such inequalities are preserved through weak convergences. In particular, we prove that L\'{e}vy processes, Bessel processes and several conditioned Brownian processes have positive correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ghosh-Peres number rigidity of translation-invariant determinantal point processes on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, whose correlation kernels are induced by the Fourier transform of the indicators of generalized Cantor sets in the unit interval. Our main results show that for any given $\theta\in(0,1)$, there exists a generalized Cantor set with Lebesgue measure $\theta$, such that the corresponding determinantal point process is Ghosh-Peres number rigid.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Sinkhorn's Algorithm for Entropic Martingale Optimal Transport Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Entropic Martingale Optimal Transport (EMOT) problem on R. We begin by introducing the dual formulation and prove the exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm on the dual potential coefficients. Our analysis does not require prior knowledge of the optimal potential and confirms that there is no primal-dual gap. Our findings provide a theoretical guarantee for solving the EMOT problem using Sinkhorn's algorithm. In applications, our result provides insight into the calibration of stochastic volatility models, as proposed by Henry-Labordere.</description>

Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^2$ $$ H = \left(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_1^2}\right)^{\alpha/2} + \left(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_2^2}\right)^{\alpha/2} + V, $$ for $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and some sufficiently regular, radial, confining potentials $V$. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on intrinsic ultracontractivity for semigroups $\{e^{-tH}: \, t \ge 0\}$. We also get sharp estimates of first eigenfunctions of $H$.</description>

      <title>On Policy Evaluation Algorithms in Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms to efficiently approximate the unknown return distributions in policy evaluation problems from distributional reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed distributional dynamic programming algorithms are suitable for underlying Markov decision processes (MDPs) having an arbitrary probabilistic reward mechanism, including continuous reward distributions with unbounded support being potentially heavy-tailed.
  For a plain instance of our proposed class of algorithms we prove error bounds, both within Wasserstein and Kolmogorov--Smirnov distances. Furthermore, for return distributions having probability density functions the algorithms yield approximations for these densities; error bounds are given within supremum norm. We introduce the concept of quantile-spline discretizations to come up with algorithms showing promising results in simulation experiments.
  While the performance of our algorithms can rigorously be analysed they can be seen as universal black box algorithms applicable to a large class of MDPs. We also derive new properties of probability metrics commonly used in DRL on which our quantitative analysis is based.</description>

      <title>Corrections to and improvements on results from "The Laplacian spectrum of large graphs sampled from graphons"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we correct the proof of Proposition 4 in our paper "The Laplacian Spectrum of Large Graphs Sampled from Graphons" (arXiv:2004.09177) and we improve several results therein. To this end, we prove a new concentration lemma about degrees and Laplacian eigenvalues. This lemma allows us to improve several bounds and to dispense from assuming that the graphon is bounded away from zero in several results. This extension leads, in particular, to correct the proof of Proposition 4. Additionally, we extend Proposition 4 to graphs that are sampled from graphons by using deterministic latent variables.</description>

      <title>Extending the Limit Theorem of Barmpalias and Lewis-Pye to all reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a celebrated result of Ku\v{c}era and Slaman (DOI:10.1137/S0097539799357441), the Martin-L\"of random left-c.e. reals form the highest left-c.e. Solovay degree. Barmpalias and Lewis-Pye (arXiv:1604.00216) strengthened this result by showing that, for all left-c.e. reals $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\beta$ is Martin-L\"of random and all left-c.e. approximations $a_0,a_1,\dots$ and $b_0,b_1,\dots$ of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively, the limit \begin{equation*}
  \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{\alpha - a_n}{\beta - b_n} \end{equation*} exists and does not depend on the choice of the left-c.e. approximations to $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
  Here we give an equivalent formulation of the result of Barmpalias and Lewis-Pye in terms of nondecreasing translation functions and generalize their result to the set of all (i.e., not necessarily left-c.e.) reals.</description>

      <title>Rough Path Renormalization from Stratonovich to It\^o for Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.00335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an It\^o-type fractional pathwise integration theory for fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameters \( H \in (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}] \), using the Lyons' rough path framework. This approach is designed to fill gaps in conventional stochastic calculus models that fail to account for temporal persistence prevalent in dynamic systems such as those found in economics, finance, and engineering. The pathwise-defined method not only meets the zero expectation criterion but also addresses the challenges of integrating non-semimartingale processes, which traditional It\^o calculus cannot handle. We apply this theory to fractional Black-Scholes models and high-dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, illustrating the advantages of this approach. Additionally, the paper discusses the generalization of It\^o integrals to rough differential equations (RDE) driven by fBM, emphasizing the necessity of integrand-specific adaptations in the It\^o rough path lift for stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Area Analysis and Parameter Estimation for fOU Processes via Non-Geometric Rough Path Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1803.11039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation problem of an unknown drift parameter matrix for a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in a multi-dimensional setting. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach based on rough path theory that allows us to construct pathwise rough path estimators from both continuous and discrete observations of a single path. Our approach is particularly suitable for high-frequency data. To formulate the parameter estimators, we introduce a theory of pathwise It\^o integrals with respect to fractional Brownian motion. By establishing the regularity of fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and analyzing the long-term behavior of the associated L\'evy area processes, we demonstrate that our estimators are strongly consistent and pathwise stable. Our findings offer a new perspective on estimating the drift parameter matrix for fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in multi-dimensional settings, and may have practical implications for fields including finance, economics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the trajectory of the self-repelling random walk with directed edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-repelling random walk with directed edges was introduced by T\'oth and Vet\H{o} in 2008 as a nearest-neighbor random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ that is non-Markovian: at each step, the probability to cross a directed edge depends on the number of previous crossings of this directed edge. T\'oth and Vet\H{o} found this walk to have a very peculiar behavior, and conjectured that, denoting the walk by $(X_m)_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$, for any $t \geq 0$ the quantity $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor}$ converges in distribution to a non-trivial limit when $N$ tends to $+\infty$, but the process $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor})_{t \geq 0}$ does not converge in distribution. In this paper, we prove not only that $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor})_{t \geq 0}$ admits no limit in distribution in the standard Skorohod topology, but more importantly that the trajectories of the random walk still satisfy another limit theorem, of a new kind. Indeed, we show that for $n$ suitably smaller than $N$ and $T_N$ in a large family of stopping times, the process $(\frac{1}{n}(X_{T_N+tn^{3/2}}-X_{T_N}))_{t \geq 0}$ admits a non-trivial limit in distribution. The proof partly relies on combinations of reflected and absorbed Brownian motions which may be interesting in their own right.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for boundary traces of reflected diffusions on uniform domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary trace processes of reflected diffusions on uniform domains. We obtain stable-like heat kernel estimates for such a boundary trace process when the diffusion on the underlying ambient space satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates. Our arguments rely on new results of independent interest such as sharp two-sided estimates and the volume doubling property of the harmonic measure, the existence of a continuous extension of the Na\"im kernel to the topological boundary, and the Doob--Na\"im formula identifying the Dirichlet form of the boundary trace process as the pure-jump Dirichlet form whose jump kernel with respect to the harmonic measure is exactly (the continuous extension of) the Na\"im kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14265v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how long-lived, rational agents learn in a social network. In every period, after observing the past actions of his neighbors, each agent receives a private signal, and chooses an action whose payoff depends only on the state. Since equilibrium actions depend on higher order beliefs, it is difficult to characterize behavior. Nevertheless, we show that regardless of the size and shape of the network, the utility function, and the patience of the agents, the speed of learning in any equilibrium is bounded from above by a constant that only depends on the private signal distribution.</description>

      <title>Composition schemes: q-enumerations and phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composition schemes are ubiquitous in combinatorics, statistical mechanics and probability theory. We give a unifying explanation to various phenomena observed in the combinatorial and statistical physics literature in the context of~$q$-enumeration (this is a model where objects with a parameter of value $k$ have a Gibbs measure/Boltzmann weight $q^k$). For structures enumerated by a composition scheme, we prove a phase transition for any parameter having such a Gibbs measure: for a critical value $q=q_c$, the limit law of the parameter is a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, while it is Gaussian in the supercritical regime ($q&gt;q_c$), and it is a Boltzmann distribution in the subcritical regime ($0&lt;q&lt;q_c$). We apply our results to fundamental statistics of lattice paths and quarter-plane walks. We also explain previously observed limit laws for pattern-restricted permutations, and a phenomenon uncovered by Krattenthaler for the wall contacts in watermelons.</description>

      <title>Separation rates for the detection of synchronization of interacting point processes in a mean field frame. Application to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and study a statistical test to detect synchrony in spike trains. Our test is based on the number of coincidences between two trains of spikes. The data are supplied in the form of \(n\) pairs (assumed to be independent) of spike trains. The aim is to assess whether the two trains in a pair are also independent. Our approach is based on previous results of Albert et al. (2015, 2019) and Kim et al. (2022) that we extend to our setting, focusing on the construction of a non-asymptotic criterion ensuring the detection of synchronization in the framework of permutation tests. Our criterion is constructed such that it ensures the control of the Type II error, while the Type I error is controlled by construction. We illustrate our results within two classical models of interacting neurons, the jittering Poisson model and Hawkes processes having \(M\) components interacting in a mean field frame and evolving in stationary regime. For this latter model, we obtain a lower bound of the size \(n\) of the sample necessary to detect the dependency between two neurons.</description>

      <title>Simple, unified analysis of Johnson-Lindenstrauss with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10232v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified and unified analysis of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, a cornerstone of dimensionality reduction for managing high-dimensional data. Our approach simplifies understanding and unifies various constructions under the JL framework, including spherical, binary-coin, sparse JL, Gaussian, and sub-Gaussian models. This unification preserves the intrinsic geometry of data, essential for applications from streaming algorithms to reinforcement learning. We provide the first rigorous proof of the spherical construction's effectiveness and introduce a general class of sub-Gaussian constructions within this simplified framework. Central to our contribution is an innovative extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to high dimensions, complete with explicit constants. By using simple yet powerful probabilistic tools and analytical techniques, such as an enhanced diagonalization process, our analysis solidifies the theoretical foundation of the JL lemma by removing an independence assumption and extends its practical applicability to contemporary algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The group symmetries inherent in quantum channels often make them tractable and applicable to various problems in quantum information theory. In this paper, we introduce natural probability distributions for covariant quantum channels. Specifically, this is achieved through the application of ``twirling operations'' on random quantum channels derived from the Stinespring representation that use Haar-distributed random isometries. We explore various types of group symmetries, including unitary and orthogonal covariance, hyperoctahedral covariance, diagonal orthogonal covariance (DOC), and analyze their properties related to quantum entanglement based on the model parameters. In particular, we discuss the threshold phenomenon for positive partial transpose and entanglement breaking properties, comparing thresholds among different classes of random covariant channels. Finally, we contribute to the PPT$^2$ conjecture by showing that the composition between two random DOC channels is generically entanglement breaking.</description>
