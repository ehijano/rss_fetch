      <title>The magnetic Laplacian on the Disc for strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Laplacian on a planar domain under a strong constant magnetic field has eigenvalues close to the Landau levels. We study the case when the domain is a disc and the spectrum consists of branches of eigenvalues of one dimensional operators. Under Neumann boundary condition and strong magnetic field, we derive asymptotics of the eigenvalues with accurate estimates of exponentially small remainders. Our approach is purely variational and applies to the Dirichlet boundary condition as well, which allows us to recover recent results by Baur and Weidl.</description>

      <title>Riesz means asymptotics for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and prove two-term asymptotics for their Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. Moreover, when the underlying domain is convex, we obtain universal, non-asymptotic bounds that correctly reproduce the two leading terms in the asymptotics and depend on the domain only through simple geometric characteristics. An important ingredient in the proof of the latter result is a pointwise bound for the heat kernel of the Neumann Laplacian in a convex domain with universal constants. Additional ingredients in our proof are non-asymptotic versions of various Tauberian theorems.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral theory of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are lecture notes from a course given at the summer school "Heat kernels and spectral geometry: from manifolds to graphs" in Bregenz, Austria, 2022. They are designed to be accessible to doctoral level students, and include background chapters on Laplacians on domains and quantum graphs before moving on to specialised topics involving the dependence and optimisation of operator eigenvalues on a metric graph in function of the graph geometry, drawn in part from the recent literature.</description>

      <title>Guided modes in a hexagonal periodic graph like domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of guided waves and edge states in particular two-dimensional media obtained by perturbing a reference periodic medium with honeycomb symmetry. This reference medium is a thin periodic domain (the thickness is denoted $\delta$ \&amp;gt; 0) with an hexagonal structure, which is close to an honeycomb quantum graph. In a first step, we show the existence of Dirac points (conical crossings) at arbitrarily large frequencies if $\delta$ is chosen small enough. We then perturbe the domain by cutting the perfectly periodic medium along the so-called zigzag direction, and we consider either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the cut edge. In the two cases, we prove the existence of edges modes as well as their robustness with respect to some perturbations, namely the location of the cut and the thickness of the perturbed edge. In particular, we show that different locations of the cut lead to almost-non dispersive edge states, the number of locations increasing with the frequency. All the results are obtained via asymptotic analysis and semi-explicit computations done on the limit quantum graph. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e Kernels and Surface Defects at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the spectral analysis of canonically quantized four-dimensional Seiberg-Witten curves can be systematically studied via the Nekrasov-Shatashvili functions. In this paper, we explore another aspect of the relation between $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and operator theory. Specifically, we study an example of an integral operator associated with Painlev\'e equations and whose spectral traces are related to correlation functions of the 2d Ising model. This operator does not correspond to a canonically quantized Seiberg-Witten curve, but its kernel can nevertheless be interpreted as the density matrix of an ideal Fermi gas. Adopting the approach of Tracy and Widom, we provide an explicit expression for its eigenfunctions via an $\mathrm{O}(2)$ matrix model. We then show that these eigenfunctions are computed by surface defects in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ super Yang-Mills in the self-dual phase of the $\Omega$-background. Our result also yields a strong coupling expression for such defects which resums the instanton expansion. Even though we focus on one concrete example, we expect these results to hold for a larger class of operators arising in the context of isomonodromic deformation equations.</description>
