      <title>Multiple magnetic interactions and large inverse magnetocaloric effect in TbSi and TbSi$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure, magnetization, specific heat, and crystallography of TbSi (FeB structure type) and TbSi$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ (CrB structure type) compounds. Both TbSi and TbSi$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ exhibit two antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at T$_{\rm N1}\approx$ 58~K and 57~K, and T$_{\rm N2}\approx$ 36~K and 44~K, respectively, along with an onset of weak metamagnetic-like transition around 6~T between T$_{\rm N1}$ and T$_{\rm N2}$. High-resolution specific heat (C$_{\rm P}$) measurements show the second- and first-order nature of the magnetic transition at T$_{\rm N1}$ and T$_{\rm N2}$, respectively, for both samples. However, in the case of TbSi, the low-temperature (LT) AFM to high-temperature (HT) AFM transition takes place via an additional AFM phase at the intermediate temperature (IT), where both LT to IT AFM and IT to HT AFM phase transitions exhibit a first-order nature. Both TbSi and TbSi$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ manifest significant magnetic entropy changes ($\Delta S_{\rm M}$) of 9.6 and 11.6~J/kg-K, respectively, for $\Delta \mu_0H$=7~T, at T$_{\rm N2}$. The HT AFM phase of TbSi$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ is found to be more susceptible to the external magnetic field, causing a significant broadening in the peaks of $\Delta S_{\rm M}$ curves at higher magnetic fields. Temperature and field-dependent specific heat data have been utilized to construct the complex H-T phase diagram of these compounds. Furthermore, temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate substantial magnetostriction and anisotropic thermal expansion of the unit cell in both samples.</description>

      <title>The structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure-dependent functional properties of Mn-containing perovskite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of nanoparticles are determined by their size and structure. When exposed to external pressure P, their structural properties can change. The improvement or degradation of the properties of the samples depending on time is particularly interesting. The knowledge of the influence of structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure on the behavior of the compounds is essential for fundamental and applied purposes.Therefore, the first attempts have been made to shed light on how the functional properties of the Mn-containing perovskites change depending on them. The nanoparticles of different sizes, from 20 to 70 nm, have been obtained. After 3 years, their structural properties underwent significant changes, including an increase in particle size, bandwidth, and microstrains, as well as a reduction in dislocation density.The greatest change in the structure is observed for the smallest nanoparticles. The phase transition temperatures increase with nanoparticle size, time, and pressure. The aging time has the strongest influence on the changing Curie temperature for the smallest and most magnetically inhomogeneous nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 100 K / GPa. Conversely, the structural-size effect and external pressure have the greatest influence on the biggest and most magnetically uniform nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 91 and 16 K / GPa, respectively. After 3 years, the biggest nanoparticles demonstrate the most stable phase transition temperatures with improved magnetocaloric parameters near room temperature. These structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure are powerful instruments to tune the phase transition temperatures and magnetocaloric effect of the nanoparticles. These outcomes may have implications for the whole class of perovskites and could initiate a new mainstream.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the processes of plastic deformation and acoustic relaxation in a high-entropy alloy Al$_{0.5}$CoCrCuFeNi was carried out. The following have been established: dominant dislocation defects; types of barriers that prevent the movement of dislocations; mechanisms of thermally activated movement of various elements of dislocation lines through barriers at room and low temperatures. Based on modern dislocation theory, quantitative estimates have been obtained for the most important characteristics of dislocations and their interaction with barriers.</description>

      <title>Enforced symmetry breaking for valley polarization in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of the valley polarization in solids are crucial for valleytronics, which is mainly limited to the analysis of inversion and time-reversal symmetries for two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal systems. Here, through group theory analysis, we propose general rules for the generation and manipulation of valley polarization in 2D hexagonal lattices. The generation of valley polarization requires breaking the specific enforced symmetry that is associated with different valleys or reverses the sign of Berry curvature. Further manipulation of valley polarization requires asymmetry operators connecting two states with opposite signs of Berry curvature. These rules for generating and manipulating valley polarization are extendable to generic points in momentum space. Combined with first-principles calculations, we realize the controllable valley polarization in three representative systems, i.e., monolayer FeCl2, bilayer TcGeSe3, and monolayer CrOBr. Our work provides symmetry rules for designing valleytronic materials that could facilitate the experimental detection and realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Mixed quantum-classical modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solids: Application to optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mixed quantum-classical framework for the microscopic and non-Markovian modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solid-state materials, and apply it to calculate the optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2. Within this framework, we combine reciprocal-space mixed quantum-classical dynamics with models for the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, although noting that a direct interfacing with ab initio calculations is straightforward in principle. We introduce various parameters for truncating the Brillouin zone to select regions of interest. Variations of these parameters allow us to determine linewidths in the limit of asymptotic material sizes. Obtained asymptotic linewidths are found to agree favorably with experimental measurements across a range of temperatures. As such, our framework establishes itself as a promising route towards unraveling the non-Markovian and microscopic principles governing the nonadiabatic dynamics of solids.</description>

      <title>Fitting to magnetic forces improves the reliability of magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fitting machine-learning interatomic potentials with magnetic degrees of freedom, namely, magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials (mMTP). The main feature of the methodology consists in fitting mMTP to magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) derived from spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We test our method on the bcc Fe-Al system with different composition. Specifically, we calculate formation energies, equilibrium lattice parameter, and total cell magnetization. Our findings demonstrate a precise match between values calculated with mMTP and those obtained by DFT at zero temperature. Additionally, using molecular dynamics, we estimate the finite temperature lattice parameter and capture the cell expansion as was previously revealed in experiment. We demonstrate that mMTPs fitted to magnetic forces, increase the relaxation reliability, which is the percent of successfully relaxed structures (i.e. with almost zero forces, stresses, and magnetic moments after the optimization of geometry). Eventually, we show that the proposed methodology can provide an accurate and reliable mMTP with reduced number of computationally complex spin-polarized density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Overcoming systematic softening in universal machine learning interatomic potentials by fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have introduced a new paradigm for atomic simulations. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) that are pre-trained on diverse materials datasets, providing opportunities for both ready-to-use universal force fields and robust foundations for downstream machine learning refinements. However, their performance in extrapolating to out-of-distribution complex atomic environments remains unclear. In this study, we highlight a consistent potential energy surface (PES) softening effect in three uMLIPs: M3GNet, CHGNet, and MACE-MP-0, which is characterized by energy and force under-prediction in a series of atomic-modeling benchmarks including surfaces, defects, solid-solution energetics, phonon vibration modes, ion migration barriers, and general high-energy states.
  We find that the PES softening behavior originates from a systematic underprediction error of the PES curvature, which derives from the biased sampling of near-equilibrium atomic arrangements in uMLIP pre-training datasets. We demonstrate that the PES softening issue can be effectively rectified by fine-tuning with a single additional data point. Our findings suggest that a considerable fraction of uMLIP errors are highly systematic, and can therefore be efficiently corrected. This result rationalizes the data-efficient fine-tuning performance boost commonly observed with foundational MLIPs. We argue for the importance of a comprehensive materials dataset with improved PES sampling for next-generation foundational MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle and Excitonic Structures of Few-layer and Bulk GaSe: Interlayer Coupling, Self-energy, and Electron-hole Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal monochalcogenide GaSe is a classic layered semiconductor that has received increasing research interest due to its highly tunable electronic and optical properties for ultrathin electronics applications. Despite intense research efforts, a systematic understanding of the layer-dependent electronic and optical properties of GaSe remains to be established, and there appear significant discrepancies between different experiments. We have performed GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations for few-layer and bulk GaSe, aiming at understanding the effects of interlayer coupling and dielectric screening on excited state properties of GaSe, and how the electronic and optical properties evolve from strongly two-dimensional (2D) like to intermediate thick layers, and to three-dimensional (3D) bulk character. Using a new definition of the exciton binding energy, we are able to calculate the binding energies of all excitonic states. Our results reveal an interesting correlation between the binding energy of an exciton and the spread of its wave function in the real and momentum spaces. We find that the existence of (nearly) parallel valence and conduction bands facilitates the formation of excitonic states that spread out in the momentum space. Thus, these excitons tend to be more localized in real space and have large exciton binding energies. The interlayer coupling substantially suppresses the Mexican-hat-like dispersion of the top valence band seen in monolayer system, explaining the greatly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) as layer thickness increases. Our results also help resolve apparent discrepancies between different experiments. After including the quasiparticle and excitonic effects as well the optical activities of excitons, our results compare well with available experimental results.</description>

      <title>Two-Shot Optimization of Compositionally Complex Refractory Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a synergistic computational/experimental approach is presented for the rapid discovery and characterization of novel alloys within the compositionally complex (i.e., "medium/high entropy") refractory alloy space of Ti-V-Nb-Mo-Hf-Ta-W. This was demonstrated via a material design cycle aimed at simultaneously maximizing the objective properties of high specific hardness (hardness normalized by density) and high specific elastic modulus (elastic modulus normalized by density). This framework utilizes high-throughput computational thermodynamics and intelligent filtering to first reduce the untenably large alloy space to a feasible size, followed by an iterative design cycle comprised of high-throughput synthesis, processing, and characterization in batch sizes of 24 alloys. After the first iteration, Bayesian optimization was utilized to inform selection of the next batch of 24 alloys. This paper demonstrates the benefit of using batch Bayesian optimization (BBO) in material design, as significant gains in the objective properties were observed after only two iterations or "shots" of the design cycle without using any prior knowledge or physical models of how the objective properties relate to the design inputs (i.e., composition). Specifically, the hypervolume of the Pareto front increased by 54% between the first and second iterations. Furthermore, 10 of the 24 alloys in the second iteration dominated all alloys from the first iteration.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic piezoelectricity of PZT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unresolved issue in the commonly used Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT) ceramics is understanding the intrinsic piezoelectric behaviors of its crystal around the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to grow c-axis oriented PZT around MPB on stainless steel SUS430, allowing us to estimate the intrinsic piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of PZT along its polar axis. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 and spontaneous polarization Ps were found to be 46.4 +- 4.4 pm/V, 88.7+-4.6 uC/cm2, respectively, for x = 0.47 close to MPB. These values align well with the predicted values of d33 = 50 - 55 pC/N and Ps=79 uC/cm2 at room temperature from the first-principles-derived approach. The obtained d33 is 4 times smaller than that of its ceramics, indicating that the large piezoelectric response in the PZT ceramics around MPB is primarily driven by extrinsic effects rather than intrinsic ones. In the technical application of PZT films, achieving a substantial piezoelectric response requires careful consideration of these extrinsic effects.</description>

      <title>Dual role of longitudinal optical phonons for generation of coherent oscillations in gallium arsenide under optical pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and simple picture of the generation dynamics of coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonons and LO-phonon-plasmon-coupled (LOPC) modes by the ultrafast infrared pump-pulses in gallium arsenide (GaAs) employing the low-temperature approximation. LO phonons exhibit a pronounced coupling with plasmons formed by the optically excited electrons in the excited states of GaAs. This coupling results in the coherent oscillation of the LOPC modes in the excited states. The pump pulse also induces stimulated Raman scattering, which generates the coherent LO-phonon oscillation in the ground state. This picture is incorporated into a simplified model, and the time evolution of the density operator is calculated using the Lindblad-type quantum master equation. The theoretical results explain well the reported experimental results on the coherent oscillation of LO phonons and LOPC modes observed through transient reflection measurements. Above all, our model provides a natural reason for the simultaneous manifestation of the LO phonons and the LOPC modes.</description>

      <title>Giant intrinsic nonlinear phonon-magnon coupling in the antiferromagnet CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of strongly coupled lattice and spin dynamics in altermagnet CoF$_2$ is reported. On the background of the expected spin-phonon interaction leading to renormalization of all phonons at the Neel temperature an additional strong coupling between one-magnon excitation and the lowest frequency Raman-active phonon of B1g symmetry was observed and manifested an anomaly in its energy, full width, and intensity at temperature T*=23 K precisely where the frequency of the phonon becomes exactly twice the frequency of the magnon. We assigned this effect to unique magnon-phonon coupling in the form of a two-magnons-one-phonon interaction. The consistent experimental data clearly demonstrate that there is an intrinsic coupling that does not require coherent excitation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating QM/MM simulations of electrochemical interfaces through machine learning of electronic charge densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial aspect in the simulation of electrochemical interfaces consists in treating the distribution of electronic charge of electrode materials that are put in contact with an electrolyte solution. Recently, it has been shown how a machine-learning method that specifically targets the electronic charge density, also known as SALTED, can be used to predict the long-range response of metal electrodes in model electrochemical cells. In this work, we provide a full integration of SALTED with MetalWalls, a program for performing classical simulations of electrochemical systems. We do so by deriving a spherical harmonics extension of the Ewald summation method, which allows us to efficiently compute the electric field originated by the predicted electrode charge distribution. We show how to use this method to drive the molecular dynamics of an aqueous electrolyte solution under the quantum electric field of a gold electrode, which is matched to the accuracy of density-functional theory. Notably, we find that the resulting atomic forces present a small error of the order of 1 meV/{\AA}, demonstrating the great effectiveness of adopting an electron-density path in predicting the electrostatics of the system. Upon running the data-driven dynamics over about 3 ns, we observe qualitative differences in the interfacial distribution of the electrolyte with respect to the results of a classical simulation. By greatly accelerating quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics approaches applied to electrochemical systems, our method opens the door to nanoseconds timescales in the accurate atomistic description of the electrical double layer.</description>

      <title>Water-enhancing gels exhibiting heat-activated formation of silica aerogels for protection of critical infrastructure during catastrophic wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire-retardant materials, water-enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water-enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, we developed unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat-activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next-generation water-enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.</description>

      <title>Light-induced torque in ferromagnetic metals via orbital angular momentum generated by photon-helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated photon-helicity-induced magnetization precession in Co$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$ alloy thin films. In addition to field-like torque, attributable to magnetic field generation owing to {\it the inverse Faraday effect}, we observed non-trivial and large damping-like torque which has never been discussed for single ferromagnetic layer. The composition dependence of those two torques is effectively elucidated by a model that considers mutual coupling via spin-orbit interaction between magnetization and the electronic orbital angular momentum generated by photon-helicity. This work significantly enhances our understanding of the physics relevant to the interplay of photon-helicity and magnetization in magnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Anisotropic Hybridizations of Solid-state Electrolyte Nano-films in Li-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li2WO4 (LWO) is recognized for its potential as a solid-state electrolyte and it has demonstrated the ability to enhance the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathodes in Li-ion batteries. However, prior investigations into LWO have predominantly involved polycrystalline structures, thereby lacking a comprehensive understanding of its behavior when interfaced with single crystal systems, particularly those intricately connected to LCO. In this study, we employ pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to epitaxially synthesize LWO nano-films on LCO layers with different orientations. Based on a series of high-resolution synchrotron-based techniques including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), the electronic structure of LWO is carefully scrutinized where a higher main energy level of W5d(eg)-O2p orbitals hybridization in LWO/LCO(104) as compared to LWO/LCO(003) has been observed. This experimental finding is further validated by a comprehensive set of density of states calculations. Furthermore, detailed polarized XAS characterization unveils distinct anisotropy between the two oriented LWO configurations. This comprehensive scientific investigation, harnessing the capabilities of synchrotron-based techniques, provides invaluable insights for future studies, offering guidance for the optimized utilization of LWO as a solid-state electrolyte or modification layer for LCO cathodes in high-powered Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric domain engineering from micrometer to {\AA}ngstr{\o}m scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of magnetoelectric multiferroics depends on the formation, size, and coupling of their magnetic and electric domains. Knowing the parameters guiding these criteria is a key effort in the emerging field of magnetoelectric domain engineering. Here we show, using a combination of piezoresponse-force microscopy, non-linear optics, and x-ray scattering, that the correlation length setting the size of the ferroelectric domains in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites can be engineered from the micron range down to a few unit cells under the substitution of Mn$^{3+}$ ions with Al$^{3+}$ ions. The magnetoelectric coupling mechanism between the antiferromagnetic Mn$^{3+}$ order and the distortive-ferroelectric order remains intact even at substantial replacement of Mn$^{3+}$ by Al$^{3+}$. Hence, chemical substitution proves to be an effective tool for domain-size engineering in one of the most studied classes of multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure-Based Multioutput Property Prediction of Lithium Manganese Nickel Oxide using EfficientNet-B0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present an EfficientNet-B0-based model to directly predict multiple properties of lithium manganese nickel oxides (LMNO) using their crystal structure images. The model is supposed to predict the energy above the convex hull, bandgap energy, crystal systems, and crystal space groups of LMNOs. In the last layer of the model, a linear function is used to predict the bandgap energy and energy above the convex hull, while a SoftMax function is used to classify the crystal systems and crystal space groups. In the test set, the percentages of coefficient of determination (R2) scores are 97.73% and 96.50% for the bandgap energy and energy above the convex hull predictions, respectively, while the percentages of accuracy are 99.45% and 99.27% for the crystal system and crystal space group classifications, respectively. The class saliency maps explain that the model pays more attention to the shape of the crystal lattices and gradients around the lattice region occupied by the larger ions. This work provides new insight into using an intelligent model to directly relate the crystal structures of LMNO materials with their properties.</description>

      <title>Growth of GeO2 on R-plane and C-plane Sapphires by MOCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile Germanium Dioxide (GeO2) has been recently theoretically identified as an ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor with bandgap 4.68 eV similar to Ga2O3 but having bipolar dopability and ~2x higher electron mobility, Baliga figure of merit (BFOM) and thermal conductivity than Ga2O3. Bulk crystal growth is rapidly moving towards making large sized native substrates available. These outstanding material properties position GeO2 as a highly attractive UWBG semiconductor for various applications. However, the epitaxial growth in the most advantageous polymorph (rutile), ensuring controlled phase, pristine surface/interface quality, precise microstructure, and optimal functional properties, is still in its infancy. In this work, we explored growth of GeO2 by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on both C- and R-plane sapphire. Utilizing tetramethylgermane (TMGe) as a precursor, we have investigated the influences of different parameters on the film properties, including growth temperature, chamber pressure, TMGe flow rate, oxygen flow rate, shroud gas flow rate, and rotation speed. The total pressure emerged as a crucial parameter while growth attempts at low total pressure resulted in no films for a wide range of temperatures, precursor flow rate, argon flow rates, and susceptor rotation rate. A phase diagram, derived from our experimental findings, delineates the growth windows for GeO2 films on sapphire substrates. This study serves as a pioneering guide for the MOCVD growth of GeO2 films.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced phase transition in pyrochlore iridates (Sm$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$)$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($x =$ 0, 0.02, and 0.10): Raman and X-ray diffraction studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyrochlore iridates, A$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, show a wide variety of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties controlled by the interplay of different exchange interactions, which can be tuned by external pressure. In this work, we report pressure-induced phase transitions at ambient temperature using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (up to ~ 20 GPa) and Raman-scattering measurements (up to ~ 25 GPa) of the pyrochlore series (Sm$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$)$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($x =$ 0, 0.02, and 0.10). Our Raman and X-ray data suggest an iso-structural transition in Sm$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ at Pc ~ 11.2 GPa associated with the rearrangement of IrO6 octahedra in the pyrochlore lattice. The transition pressure decreases to ~ 10.2 and 9 GPa for $x =$ 0.02 and 0.10, respectively. For all the samples, the linewidth of three phonons associated with Ir-O-Ir (A1g and Eg) and Ir-O (T$_2$g$_4$) vibrations show anomalous decrease up to Pc, due to decrease in electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploration of oxyfluoride frameworks as Na-ion cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are increasingly looked at as a viable alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance, low cost, and thermal stability of Na-based systems. To improve the practical utilization of NIBs in applications, it is important to boost the energy and power densities of the electrodes being used, via discovery of novel candidate materials. Thus, we explore the chemical space of transition metal containing oxyfluorides (TMOFs) that adopt the perovskite structure as possible NIB electrodes. Our choice of the perovskite structure is motivated by the `large' cationic tunnels that can accommodate Na$^+$, while the chemistry of TMOFs is motivated by the high electronegativity and inductive effect of F$^-$, which can possibly lead to higher voltages. We use density functional theory based calculations to estimate the ground state polymorphs, average Na (de)intercalation voltages, thermodynamic stabilities and Na$^+$ mobility on two distinct sets of compositions: the F-rich Na$_{x}$MOF$_{2}$, and the O-rich Na$_{1+x}$MO$_{2}$F where $x$ = 0--1 and M~=~Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni. Upon identifying the ground state polymorphs in the charged compositions (i.e., MOF$_2$ and NaMO$_2$F), we show that F-rich perovskites exhibit higher average voltages compared to O-rich perovskites. Also, we find six stable/metastable perovskites in the F-rich space, while all O-rich perovskites (except NaTiO$_2$F) are unstable. Finally, our Na-ion mobility calculations indicate that TiOF$_{2}$-NaTiOF$_2$, VOF$_{2}$-NaVOF$_2$, CrOF$_{2}$, and NaMnOF$_{2}$ can be promising compositions for experimental exploration as NIB cathodes, primarily if used in a strained electrode configuration and/or thin film batteries. Our computational approach and findings provide insights into developing practical NIBs involving fluorine-containing intercalation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Direct electron beam writing of silver using a $\beta$-diketonate precursor: first insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct electron beam writing is a powerful tool for fabricating complex nanostructures in a single step. The electron beam locally cleaves the molecules of an adsorbed gaseous precursor to form a deposit, similar to 3D printing but without the need for a resist or development step. Here, we employ for the first time a silver $\beta$-diketonate precursor for focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). The used compound (hfac)AgPMe$_3$ operates at an evaporation temperature of 70 - 80{\deg}C and is compatible with commercially available gas injection systems used in any standard scanning electron microscope. Growth of smooth 3D geometries could be demonstrated for tightly focused electron beams, albeit with low silver contents in the deposit volume. The electron beam induced deposition proved sensitive to the irradiation conditions leading to varying compositions of the deposit and internal inhomogeneities such as the formation of a layered structure consisting of a pure silver layer at the interface to the substrate covered by a deposit layer with low silver content. Imaging after the deposition process revealed morphological changes such as the growth of silver particles on the surface. While these effects complicate the application for 3D printing, the unique deposit structure with a thin, compact silver film beneath the deposit body is interesting from a fundamental point of view and may offer additional opportunities for applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing financial and environmental cost of many inorganic materials has motivated study into organic and "green" alternatives. However, most organic compounds contain a large number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, posing a significant barrier to high-throughput screening for functional properties. In this work, we attempt to overcome this challenge and identify superconducting candidates among the metal-organic-frameworks in the organic materials database using a recently proposed proxy for the electron-phonon coupling. We then isolate the most promising candidate for in-depth analysis, C$_{9}$H$_{8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{11}$, providing evidence for superconductivity below $100$mK.</description>

      <title>Super-concentrated alkali hydroxide electrolytes for rechargeable Zn batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rechargeable Zn batteries offer safe, inexpensive energy storage, but when deeply discharged to compete with lithium-ion batteries, they are plagued by parasitic reactions at the Zn anodes. We apply super-concentrated alkaline electrolytes to suppress two key parasitic reactions, hydrogen evolution and ZnO passivation. An electrolyte with 15 M KOH displays a broad electrochemical window (&gt;2.5 V on Au), a high ZnO solubility (&gt;1.5 M), and an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27 S/cm at 25 C). Spectroscopies and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation suggest K+-OH- pairs and a tightened water network to underpin the stability. The simulation further reveals unique triggered proton hopping that offsets the lack of water wires to sustain the conductivity. Low hydrogen evolution, confirmed via online mass spectroscopy, and slow passivation enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity of 8.4 Ah cm-2 and a Zn-air battery to last for over 110 hours.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of H2 on the physical properties of Fe25Pd75. Broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy revealed a significant FMR peak shift induced by H2 absorption for the FCC phased Fe25Pd75. The peak shifted towards higher applied fields, which is contrary to what was previously observed for CoPd alloys. Additionally, we conducted structural and magneto-optical Kerr ellipsometric studies on the Fe25Pd75 film and performed density functional theory calculations to explore the electronic and magnetic properties in both hydrogenated and dehydrogenated states. In the final part of this study, we deposited a Fe25Pd75 layer on top of a microscopic coplanar transmission line and investigated the FMR response of the layer while driven by a microwave current in the coplanar line. We observed a large amplitude FMR response upon hydrogen absorption, as well as desorption rates when cycling between pure N2 and a mixture of 3% H2 + 97% N2.</description>

      <title>Reducing the oxygen contamination in conductive (Ti,Zr)N coatings via RF-bias assisted reactive sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary transition metal nitride coatings are promising for many applications as they can offer improved hardness and oxidation resistance compared to binary counterparts. A common challenge in the deposition of functional nitride thin films is oxygen contamination. Even low amounts of oxygen contamination can adversely affect the functional properties of the thin films. Here, we present a practical approach for the growth of virtually oxygen-free (Ti, Zr)N thin films. To cover the complete compositional range of (Ti,Zr)N coatings we employ combinatorial reactive co-sputtering. The depositions are carried out with or without applying a low-power radio-frequency (RF) bias voltage to the substrate holder to study the possibility of decelerating energetic oxygen ions and effectively reducing oxygen contamination in the growing film. High-throughput structural analysis and functional property mapping are used to elucidate the synthesis-property relationships. The structural analysis indicates solid solution formation over the entire compositional range, as evidenced by Vegardian lattice scaling, regardless of the applied RF substrate bias. Irrespective of the composition of the films, the application of RF substrate bias leads to a dramatic reduction of oxygen contamination, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth-profile mapping. This is reflected in a significant improvement in the films' conductivity and hardness. We demonstrate that the reduction in oxygen contamination is intrinsic to the process and not due to changes in the microstructure. The approach presented here is applicable to both conductive and insulating substrates and provides a practical route to synthesize nitride thin films with improved purity that can be applied in standard sputter chambers and on many different material systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon and magnon dynamics across antiferromagnetic transition in 2D layered van der Waals material CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent reflectivity spectra of the layered van der Waals magnet CrSBr in the far-infrared region. Polarization-dependent measurements resolve the vibrational modes along the E$\|a$- and $b$-axes and reveal the clear structural anisotropy. While the $a$-axis phonons notably harden on cooling, the $b$-axis phonon frequencies are almost temperature-independent. A phonon splitting due to the antiferromagnetic phase transition is observed for the 180~cm$^{-1}$ $a$-axis vibrational mode, accompanied by a phonon softening below $T_N$. Furthermore, an additional mode with strong magnetic characteristics at $\sim$360~cm$^{-1}$ is identified and attributed to the magnon excitation of CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Phonon Assisted Exciton Processes in Two-Dimensional Tungsten Monocarbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: n this study, we utilize a rigorous ab initio-based finite momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate the photoluminescence emission in two-dimensional hexagonal tungsten carbide (h-WC). This thermodynamically stable monolayer exhibits an indirect optical gap, resulting in phonon-assisted emission. We observe that light absorption is a direct process centered around the direct quasiparticle gap, while light emission is indirect and requires modes between $\Gamma$-$M$ in the phonon dispersion. The emission lines feature prominent phonon replicas at cryogenic temperatures, particularly near-infrared wavelengths (1.09 and 1.17 eV), and we observe exciton thermalization with the crystal beyond 25 K. Additionally, non-radiative recombination is a remarkably fast process, occurring at order of a few femtoseconds (4.8 fs at 0 K and 2.8 fs at 300 K) compared to radiative recombination (2.3 ps at 0 K and 214 ns at 300 K). These optical characteristics of 2D h-WC may facilitate the promise of photon-emitter devices for near-infrared signal communication.</description>

      <title>Discovery of highly anisotropic dielectric crystals with equivariant graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropy in crystals plays a pivotal role in many technological applications. For example, anisotropic electronic and thermal transport are thought to be beneficial for thermoelectric applications, while anisotropic mechanical properties are of interest for emerging metamaterials, and anisotropic dielectric materials have been suggested as a novel platform for dark matter detection. Understanding and tailoring anisotropy in crystals is therefore essential for the design of next-generation functional materials. To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli. Here, we adopt the latest approaches in equivariant graph neural networks to develop a model that can predict the full dielectric tensor of crystals. Our model, trained on the Materials Project dataset of c.a. 6,700 dielectric tensors, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in scalar dielectric prediction in addition to capturing the directional response. We showcase the performance of the model by discovering crystals with almost isotropic connectivity but highly anisotropic dielectric tensors, thereby broadening our knowledge of the structure-property relationships in dielectric crystals.</description>

      <title>Untangling individual cation roles in rock salt high-entropy oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unravel the distinct roles each cation plays in phase evolution, stability, and properties within Mg1/5Co1/5Ni1/5Cu1/5Zn1/5O high-entropy oxide (HEO) by integrating experimental findings, thermodynamic analyses, and first-principles predictions. Our approach is through sequentially removing one cation at a time from the five-component high-entropy oxide to create five four-component derivatives. Bulk synthesis experiments indicate that Mg, Ni, and Co act as rock salt phase stabilizers whereas only Mg and Ni enthalpically enhance single-phase rock salt stability in thin film growth; synthesis conditions dictate whether Co is a rock salt phase stabilizer or destabilizer. By examining the competing phases and oxidation state preferences using pseudo-binary phase diagrams and first-principles calculations, we resolve the stability differences between bulk and thin film for all compositions. We systematically explore HEO macroscopic property sensitivity to cation selection employing both predicted and measured optical spectra. This study establishes a framework for understanding high-entropy oxide synthesizability and properties on a per-cation basis that is broadly applicable to tailoring functional property design in other high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present both a theoretical and a methodological framework that addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities, such as the electronic-structure Hamiltonian. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we address this problem by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this foundation, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove. Our approach offers a promising general solution to the critical dilemma between equivariance and non-linear expressiveness in deep learning methodologies. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark databases.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Transport in Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ Nanoribbons: Insights for Spintronic Device Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum spin Hall effect led to the exploration of the electronic transport for spintronic devices. Here, we theoretically investigated the electronic conductance in large-gap realistic quantum spin Hall system, Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ nanoribbons. By an ab initio approach, we found that the edge states present a penetration depth of about $0.9$\,{nm}, which is much smaller than those predicted in other 2D topological systems. Thus, suggesting that Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ allows the exploitation of topological transport properties in narrow ribbons. Using non-equilibrium Green's functions calculations, we have examined the electron conductivity upon the presence of Se\,$\leftrightarrow$\,Hg antistructure defects randomly distributed in the Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ scattering region. By considering scattering lengths up to $109$\,nm, we found localization lengths that can surpass $\mu$m sizes for narrow nanoribbons ($&lt;9$\,nm). These findings can contribute to further understanding the behavior of topological insulators under realistic conditions and their integration within electronic, spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals Magnetic Electrode Transfer for Two-Dimensional Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications. Maintaining their atomically smooth interfaces during integration of ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes is crucial since conventional metal deposition tends to induce defects at the interfaces. Meanwhile, the difficulties in picking up FM metals with strong adhesion and in achieving conductance match between FM electrodes and spin transport channels make it challenging to fabricate high-quality 2D spintronic devices using metal transfer techniques. Here, we report a solvent-free magnetic electrode transfer technique that employs a graphene layer to assist in the transfer of FM metals. It also serves as part of the FM electrode after transfer for optimizing spin injection, which enables the realization of spin valves with excellent performance based on various 2D materials. In addition to two-terminal devices, we demonstrate that the technique is applicable for four-terminal spin valves with nonlocal geometry. Our results provide a promising future of realizing 2D spintronic applications using the developed magnetic electrode transfer technique.</description>

      <title>Extremely long transverse optical needle focus for reflective metalens enabled by monolayer MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-scan mode facilitates fast-speed and high-throughput imaging with developing a suitable optical transverse needle focus. Metasurface with periodic structures such as diffractive rings, ellipses, and gratings could enable discrete focus evolving into line focus under momentum conservation, but still face the challenge of extremely low light power utilization brought by inevitably multiple high-order diffractions. In addition, the designed focus requires the selection of particular optical functional materials. High dielectric constants in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides make significant phase modulation by bringing phase singularity at zero-reflection possible. However, no light power is available for use at zero-reflection and a balance between phase and amplitude modulation is needed. In this work, above issues are simultaneously solved by designing a monolayer MoS2 based Fresnel strip structure. An optical needle primary focus with a transverse length of 40 {\mu}m (~80 {\lambda}) is obtained, which is the longest value recorded so far, together with a sub-diffraction-limited lateral spot and a broad working wavelength range. This specially developed structure not only concentrates light power in primary diffraction by breaking restriction of momentum conservation, but also guarantees a consistent phase across different strips. The novel optical manipulation way provided here together with the longer focus length for flat optics will show promising applications in biology, oncology, nanofabrication, energy harvesting, and optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Crystal-like thermal transport in amorphous carbon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport properties of amorphous carbon has attracted increasing attention due to its extreme thermal properties: It has been reported to have among the highest thermal conductivity for bulk amorphous solids up to $\sim$ 37 Wm\textsuperscript{-1}K\textsuperscript{-1}, comparable to crystalline sapphire ($\alpha$-Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}). Further, large density dependence in thermal conductivity demonstrates a potential for largely tunable thermal conductivity. However, mechanism behind the high thermal conductivity and its large density dependence remains elusive due to many variables at play. In this work, we perform large-scale ($\sim$ 10\textsuperscript{5} atoms) molecular dynamics simulations utilizing a machine learning potential based on neural networks. Through spectral decomposition of thermal conductivity which enables a quantum correction to classical heat capacity, we find that propagating vibrational excitations govern thermal transport in amorphous carbon ($\sim$ 100 \% of thermal conductivity) in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that diffusive vibrational excitations dominate thermal transport in amorphous solids. Instead, this remarkable behavior resembles thermal transport in simple crystals. Moreover, our temperature dependent spectral diffusivity and velocity current correlation analyses reveal that the density dependent thermal conductivity originates from anharmonicity sensitive propagating excitations. Our work suggests a novel insight and design principle into developing mechanically hard, thermally conductive amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale tunable phonon transport at tailored grain boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating thermal properties in materials has been of fundamental importance for advancing innovative technologies. Heat carriers such as phonons are impeded by breaking crystal symmetry or periodicity. Notable methods of impeding the phonon propagation include varying the density of defects, interfaces, and nanostructures, as well as changing composition. However, a robust link between the individual nanoscale defect structures, phonon states, and macroscopic thermal conductivity is lacking. Here we reveal from nanoscale structure-phonon mechanisms on how the grain boundary (GB) tilt and twist angles fundamentally drive the changes in atom rearrangements, exotic vibrational states, and finally macroscopic heat transport at different bicrystal strontium titanate GBs using emerging atomic resolution vibrational spectroscopy. The 10 deg and 22 deg tilt GBs exhibit reduced phonon populations by 54% and 16% compared to the bulk value, respectively, consistent with measured thermal conductivities. A tiny twist angle further introduces a fine and local tunning of thermal conductivity by introducing twist induced defects periodically embedded with the tilt induced GB defects. Our results demonstrate that varying the tilt angle coarsely modifies the phonon population along entire GB while varying the twist angle incurs a finer adjustment at periodic locations on the GB. Our study offers a systematic approach to understanding and manipulating cross GB thermal transport of arbitrary GBs predictably and precisely.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Orbital Origin for the Chirality-Dependent Nonlinear Planar Hall Effect of Topological Nodal Fermions in Chiral Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals in chiral crystals, which possess both structural handedness and band crossings (or nodes) with topological chiral charge, exhibit many exotic physical properties. Here we demonstrate that the structural and electronic chirality of these systems can endow them with another fascinating phenomenon -- the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (INPHE), which is prominent around the nodes and reverses sign upon chirality reversal in opposite enantiomers. Taking chiral tellurium as an example, we reveal an intrinsic orbital mechanism, which manifests diverging orbital magnetic moments with hedgehog-like textures around nodes and, therefore, generates a dominant contribution to the INPHE that is proportional to the topological charge. Furthermore, we show that multifold fermions in topological chiral semimetals with B20 structures (e.g., CoSi and PtAl) induce a giant INPHE conductivity reaching the order of $1\sim 10\; \mathrm{A}\cdot\mathrm{V}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{T}^{-1}$, which is detectable in experiments. Our study not only relates nonlinear transport to band topology and enantiomer recognition but also offers a new way to explore the exotic physical properties associated with unconventional chiral fermions.</description>

      <title>Observation of oriented Landau levels in Berry dipole semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band crossing points, such as Weyl and Dirac points, play a crucial role in the topological classification of materials and guide the exploration of exotic topological phases. The Berry dipole, a three-dimensional band crossing point beyond the Chern class, hosts a dipolar Berry curvature field and gives rise to numerous nontrivial quantum geometric effects. It has been proposed that the Berry dipole exhibits oriented Landau levels, whose spectrum critically relies on the orientation of the applied magnetic field. However, experimental demonstration of this phenomenon has remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate oriented Landau levels by carefully engineering an inhomogeneous acoustic lattice. We observe distinct Landau level spectra and different propagation properties when the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field is reversed. Notably, we discover a new type of helical zero modes whose existence critically depends on the magnetic field's orientation. Our work paves the way for studying band crossings beyond Chern-class crossing points, including Berry multipoles and even-dimensional monopoles. Furthermore, it offers new insight for exploring topological devices.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconductive circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconductive InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

      <title>Significant improvement in sensitivity of an anomalous Nernst heat flux sensor by composite structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat flux sensors (HFS) have attracted significant interest for their potential in managing waste heat efficiently. A recently proposed HFS, that works on the basis of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), offers several advantages in its simple structure leading to easy fabrication, low cost, and reduced thermal resistance. However, enhancing sensitivity through traditional material selection is now challenging due to a small number of materials satisfying the required coexistence of a large transverse Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. In this study, by utilizing composite structures and optimizing the device geometry, we have achieved a substantial improvement in the sensitivity of an ANE-based HFS. We developed composite structures comprised of a plastic substrate with an uneven surface and three-dimensional (3D) uneven TbCo films, fabricated using nanoimprint techniques and sputtering. This approach resulted in a sensitivity that is approximately four times greater than that observed in previous studies. Importantly, this method is independent of the material properties and can significantly enhance the sensitivity. Our findings could lead to the development of highly sensitive HFS devices and open new avenues for the fabrication of 3D devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slip strength of individual slip systems at different strain rates will control the mechanical response and strongly influence the anisotropy of plastic deformation. In this work, the slip activity and strain rate sensitivity of the &lt;a&gt; basal, &lt;a&gt; prismatic, and &lt;c+a&gt; pyramidal slip systems are explored by testing at variable strain rates (from 10E-4 s^-1 to 125 s^-1) using single crystal micropillar compression tests. These systematic experiments enable the direct fitting of the strain rate sensitivities of the different slips using a simple analytical model and this model reveals that deformation in polycrystals will be accommodated using different slip systems depending on the strain rate of deformation in addition to the stress state (i.e. Schmid's law). It was found that the engineering yield stress increases with strain rate, and this varied by slip systems. Activation of the prismatic slip system results in a high density of parallel, clearly discrete slip planes, while the activation of the &lt;c+a&gt; pyramidal slip leads to the plastic collapse of the pillar, leading to a 'mushroom' morphology of the deformed pillar. This characterization and model provide insight that helps inform metal forming and understanding of the mechanical performance of these engineering alloys in the extremes of service conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present a mesoscale description of deformations and defects in thin, flexible sheets with crystalline order, tackling the interplay between in-plane elasticity, out-of-plane deformation, and dislocation nucleation and motion. Our approach is based on the Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model, which describes the microscopic atomic density in crystals at diffusive timescales, naturally encoding elasticity and plasticity effects. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), a coarse-grained description of the mechanical properties of crystals is achieved. We introduce surface PFC and surface APFC models in a convenient height-function formulation encoding deformation in the normal direction. This framework is proven consistent with classical aspects of strain-induced buckling, defect nucleation on deformed surfaces, and out-of-plane relaxation near dislocations. In particular, we benchmark and discuss the results of numerical simulations by looking at the continuum limit for buckling under uniaxial compression and at evidence from microscopic models for deformation at defects and defect arrangements, demonstrating the scale-bridging capabilities of the proposed framework. Results concerning the interplay between lattice distortion at dislocations and out-of-plane deformation are also illustrated by looking at the annihilation of dislocation dipoles and systems hosting many dislocations. With the novel formulation proposed here, and its assessment with established approaches, we envision applications to multiscale investigations of crystalline order on deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Giant activated ferroelectric polarization in pristine anti-ferroelectric ZrO2 thin films</title>

Abstract: Ferroelectric fluorite oxides like hafnium (HfO2)-based materials are considered to be one of the most potential candidates for nowadays large-scale integrated-circuits (ICs). While zirconia (ZrO2)-based fluorites materials, which holds the same structure, is usually thought to be anti- or week ferroelectricity. We reported on an emergent giant ferroelectric remanent polarization (Pr) amounted to 53 {\mu}C/cm2 in orthorhombic ZrO2 growing on (110) SrTiO3 at room temperature. The robust ferroelectricity observed in ZrO2 is attributed to an irreversible orthorhombic anti-ferroelectric to a ferroelectric phase transition, facilitated by applying an electric field, particularly noticeable when the temperature is lowered to 77 K. This approach to reveal the intrinsic ferroelectricity in pure ZrO2 thin films, offers the new pathway to understand the origin ferroelectricity in fluorite oxides.</description>

Abstract: The application of first-principles calculations for predicting lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) in crystalline materials, in conjunction with the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation, has gained increasing popularity. In this calculation, the determination of force constants through first-principles calculations is critical for accurate LTC predictions. For material exploration, performing first-principles LTC calculations in a high-throughput manner is now expected, although it requires significant computational resources. To reduce computational demands, we integrated polynomial machine learning potentials on-the-fly during the first-principles LTC calculations. This paper presents a systematic approach to first-principles LTC calculations. We designed and optimized an efficient workflow that integrates multiple modular software packages. We applied this approach to calculate LTCs for 103 compounds of the wurtzite, zincblende, and rocksalt types to evaluate the performance of the polynomial machine learning potentials in LTC calculations. We demonstrate a significant reduction in the computational resources required for the LTC predictions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Hydrogen Storage Capacities: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a sophisticated hybrid machine-learning framework that significantly improves the accuracy of predicting hydrogen storage capacities in metal hydrides. This is a critical challenge due to the scarcity of experimental data and the complexity of high-dimensional feature spaces. Our approach employs the power of unsupervised learning through the use of a state-of-the-art autoencoder. This autoencoder is trained on elemental descriptors obtained from Mendeleev software, enabling the extraction of a meaningful and lower dimensional latent space from the input data. This latent representation serves as the basis for our deep multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which consists of five layers and shows good precision in predicting hydrogen storage capacities. Furthermore, our results show very good agreement with the results of density functional theory (DFT). In addition to addressing the limitations caused by limited and unevenly distributed data in the field of hydrogen storage materials, we also focus on discovering new materials that show promising opportunities for hydrogen storage. These materials were identified using both feature-based approaches and predictions generated by a large language model. Finally, our investigation into the effectiveness of transferring weights from the autoencoder to the MLP, in addition to the latent features, suggests that while this strategy slightly improves model performance indicated by a slightly higher R$^2$ value and lower RMSE, it emphasizes the intricate challenge of adapting pre-trained weights for specific supervised tasks.</description>

      <title>Gapped nodal planes drive a large topological Nernst effect in a chiral lattice antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The electronic structure of compensated antiferromagnets (CAF) has drawn attention for its ability to create large responses, reminiscent of ferromagnets and suitable for data storage and readout, despite (nearly) net-zero spontaneous magnetization. Many of the striking experimental signatures predicted for CAF, such as giant thermoelectric Nernst effects, are enhanced when two or more electronic bands are nearly degenerate in vicinity of the Fermi energy. Here, we use thermoelectric and electric transport experiments to study the electronic structure of the layered, chiral metal CoNb3S6 in its all-in-all-out CAF ground state and report near-degeneracies of electron bands at the upper and lower boundaries of the first Brillouin zone. Considering non-symmorphic spin-space group symmetries in the non-relativistic approximation for the ordered phase, these near-degeneracies are approximately protected by a lattice translation combined with spin rotation, and are vestiges of nodal planes enforced by a screw axis symmetry in the paramagnetic state. Hot spots of emergent, or fictitious, magnetic fields are formed at the slightly gapped nodal plane, generating the spontaneous Hall and Nernst effects in this CAF. Taking into account more than six hundred Wannier orbitals, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed spontaneous Nernst effect, emphasizes the role of proximate symmetries in the emergent responses of CAF, and demonstrates the promise of ab-initio search for functional responses in a wide class of materials with reconstructed unit cells due to spin or charge order.</description>

      <title>SAM-I-Am: Semantic Boosting for Zero-shot Atomic-Scale Electron Micrograph Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical enabler for tasks ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous driving. However, the correct segmentation semantics - where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? - change depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains, fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially diverse; and data sharing (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we propose the concept of semantic boosting: given a zero-shot foundation model, guide its segmentation and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain microstructure segmentation for transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and mask merging operations. We demonstrate a zero-shot performance increase of (absolute) +21.35%, +12.6%, +5.27% in mean IoU, and a -9.91%, -18.42%, -4.06% drop in mean false positive masks across images of three difficulty classes over vanilla SAM (ViT-L).</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>

      <title>Large Bulk Photovoltaic Effect of Nitride Perovskite LaWN3 as Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: First Principles Calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bulk photovoltaic effect in noncentrosymmetric materials is a fundamental and significant property that holds potential for high-efficiency energy harvesting, such as photoelectric application and photocatalysis. Here, based on first principles calculation, we explore the electronic structure, dielectric property, shift current, and photocatalytic performance of novel nitride perovskite LaWN3. Our calculations show that LaWN3 possesses large dielectric constants and shift current. The shift current can be enhanced by considering spin-orbit coupling and is switchable by ferroelectric polarization, which suggests LaWN3 is a promising candidate for logic and neuromorphic photovoltaic devices driven by ferroelectric polarization. Additionally, LaWN3 shows advanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction as a photocatalyst. Especially, the (110) surface represents low surface energy and Gibbes free energy, implying that the (110) surface may be exposed to the active surface. Our finding highlights potential applications of novel polar nitride perovskite LaWN3 in various fields not only photoelectric devices but also photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Characterization of Thermoelectric Performance in Copper-Based Chalcogenide CsCu$_3$S$_2$: Unveiling the role of Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly consider both phonon energy shifts and broadening arising from both cubic and quartic anharmonicities, as well as diagonal/non-diagonal terms of heat flux operators in thermal conductivity. Our findings show that the strong anharmonicity of CsCu$_3$S$_2$ primarily arises from the presence of $p$-$d$ anti-bonding hybridization between Cu and S atoms, coupled with the random oscillations of Cs atoms. Notably, the competition between phonon hardening described by the loop diagram and softening induced by the bubble diagram significantly influences particle-like propagation, predominantly reflected in group velocity and energy-conservation rule. Additionally, the electrical transport properties are determined by employing the precise momentum relaxation-time approximation (MRTA). At high temperatures, the thermoelectric performance of $p$-type CsCu$_3$S$_2$ reaches its optimum theoretical value of 0.94 along the in-plane direction based on advanced phonon renormalization theory. In striking contrast, the harmonic approximation theory significantly overestimates the thermoelectric efficiency at the same temperatures, rendering it an impractical expectation. Conversely, the first-order renormalization approach leads to a serious underestimation of the thermoelectric properties due to the over-correction of phonon energy. Our study not only reveals the pivotal role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in accurately assessing thermoelectric properties but also underscores the potential thermoelectric applications for novel copper-based chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface-State-Mediated Spin-Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states with ultra-high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST) with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 $k\Omega$ is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to $2.8\times10^5 A/cm^2$. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge-state-mediated to surface-state-mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to $1.56\pm 0.12 T/ (10^6 A/cm^2)$ and the interfacial charge-to-spin conversion efficiency to $3.9\pm 0.3 nm^{-1}$. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we attack the problem of "chiral phase instability" ($\chi$PI) in a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) system under a parallel and constant electromagnetic field. The $\chi$PI refers to that: When $I_2\equiv{\bf E\cdot B}$ is larger than the threshold $I_2^c$, no homogeneous solution can be found for $\sigma$ or $\pi^0$ condensate, and the chiral phase (or angle) $\theta$ becomes unstable. Within the two-flavor chiral perturbation theory, we obtain an effective Lagrangian density for $\theta(x)$ where the chiral anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten term is found to play a role of "source" to the "potential field" $\theta(x)$. The Euler-Lagrangian equation is applied to derive the equation of motion for $\theta(x)$, and physical solutions are worked out for several shapes of system. In the case $I_2&gt;I_2^c$, it is found that the $\chi$PI actually implies an inhomogeneous QCD phase with $\theta(x)$ spatially dependent. By its very nature, the homogeneous-inhomogeneous phase transition is of pure topological and second order at $I_2^c$. Finally, the work is extended to the three-flavor case, where an inhomogeneous $\eta$ condensation is also found to be developed for $I_2&gt;I_2^c$. Correspondingly, there is a second critical point, $I_2^{c'}=24.3I_2^c$, across which the transition is also of topological and second order by its very nature.</description>

      <title>GeSn Defects and their Impact on Optoelectronic Properties: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GeSn has emerged as a promising semiconductor with optoelectronic functionality in the mid-infrared, with the potential of replacing expensive III-V technology for monolithic on-chip Si photonics. Multiple challenges to achieve optoelectronic-grade GeSn have been successfully solved in the last decade. We stand today on the brink of a potential revolution in which GeSn could be used in many optoelectronic applications such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDARs) devices and lasers. However, the limited understanding and control of material defects represents today a bottleneck in the performance of GeSn-based devices, hindering their commercialisation. Point and linear defects in GeSn have a strong impact on its electronic properties, namely unintentional doping concentration, carrier lifetime and mobility, which ultimately determine the performance of optoelectronic devices. In this review, after introducing the state-of-the-art of the fabrication and properties of GeSn, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of GeSn defects and their influence on the material (opto)electronic properties. Throughout the manuscript, we highlight the critical points that are still to solve. By bringing together the different fabrication techniques available and characterizations realized we provide a wholistic view on the field of GeSn and provide elements on how it could move forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high performance differential dilatometer based on an all-fiber Michelson interferometer at cryogenic temperature with $10^{-10}$ resolution in $\delta L/L$. It resolve the linear thermal expansion coefficient by measuring the oscillating changes of sample thickness and sample temperature with the interferometer and in-situ thermometer, respectively. By measuring the linear thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ near the antiferromagnetic transition region of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ as a demonstration, we show our dilatometer is able to measure thin samples with sub-pm-level length change resolution and mK-level temperature resolution. Despite there is residual background thermal expansion of a few nm/K in measurement result, our new dilatometer is sitll a powerful tool for study of phase transition in condensed matter physics, especially significant advantages in fragile materials with sub-100$\mu$m thickness and being integrated with multiple synchronous measurements and tuning thanks to the extremely high resolution and contactless nature. The prototype design of this setup can be further improved in many aspects for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Insights into optical absorption and dark currents of the 6.1{\AA} Type-II superlattice absorbers for MWIR and SWIR applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A holistic computational analysis is developed to calculate the quantum efficiency of InAs/GaSb superlattice-based photodetectors. Starting with the electronic band characteristics computed by taking the InSb/GaAs at the interface using the 8-band k.p approach, we demonstrate the impact of InAs and GaSb widths on the bandgap, carrier concentration, and the oscillator strength for type-II superlattice absorbers. Subsequently, the alteration of these characteristics due to the extra AlSb layer in the M superlattice absorber is investigated. Extending our models for determining TE- and TM-polarized optical absorption, our calculations reveal that the TE-polarized absorption shows a substantial influence near the conduction-heavy hole band transition energy, which eventually diminishes, owing to the dominant TM-contribution due to the conduction-light hole band transition. Extending our analysis to the dark currents, we focus mainly on Schokley-Read-Hall recombination and radiative recombination at lower temperatures, and show that Schokley-Read-Hall dominates at low-level injection. We show that short-wavelength and mid-wavelength M superlattice structures exhibit higher quantum efficiency than the corresponding same bandgap type-II superlattice with the lower diffusion dark current. Further, we analyze the density of states blocked by the barrier; crucial for XBp photodetector after absorber examination. Our work thus sets a stage for a holistic and predictive theory aided analysis of the type-II superlattice absorbers, from the atomistic interfacial details all the way to the dark currents and absorption spectra.</description>

Abstract: The search for the ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FM QCP) has always been a captivating research topic in the scientific community. In pursuit of this goal, we introduced nonmagnetic transition metals to alloy with elemental nickel, and studied the magnetic properties of nickel binary alloys Ni1-xMox and Ni1-yCuy as a function of x and y up to the critical concentrations x_{cr} and y_{cr} at which the FM transition T_C disappears. T_C-x(y) phase diagrams were constructed via the Arrott-Noakes scaling of magnetization data. An enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient (the value of C/T as T \rightarrow 0) is observed near y_{cr}, manifesting the effect of quantum fluctuations near the quantum phase transition. It is evident that C/T diverges with -logT down to 0.1 K in the vicinity of y_{cr}, suggests the plausible FM QCP in Ni1-yCuy. However, in the case of Ni1-xMox, although the enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient is also observed near x_{cr}, the spin glass behavior is identified through the ac magnetic susceptibility measurement. This observation rules out the possibility of the existence of the FM QCP in Ni1-xMox.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and properties of the honeycomb antiferromagnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$</title>

Abstract: We report the magnetic structure and properties of a thiocyanate-based honeycomb magnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$ which crystallises in the unusual low-symmetry trigonal space group $P\overline{3}$. Magnetic measurements on powder samples show this material is an antiferromagnet (ordering temperature ($T_\mathrm{N,mag} = 18.1(6)\,$)K) and can be described by nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions $J=-11.07(4)\,$K. A method for growing neutron-diffraction sized single crystals (\textgreater10 mm$^3$) is demonstrated. Low temperature neutron single crystal diffraction shows that the compound adopts the collinear antiferromagnetic structure with $T_\mathrm{N,neut}= 18.94(7)\,$K, magnetic space group $P \bar{3}'$. Low temperature second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements provide no evidence of breaking of the centre of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Modelling of High-Entropy Layered Anodes and Their Electrolyte Interface</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide as they offer several routes to design materials with novel features and wide-ranging applications. Unfortunately, at present, vdW heterostructures are restricted to a small number of stackable layers, due to the weak vdW forces holding adjacent layers together. In this work, we report on computational studies of a bulk vdW material consisting of alternating TiS2 and TiSe2 (TSS) vertically arranged layers as a potential candidate for anode applications. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the effect of high entropy on several electrochemically relevant properties of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at the transition metal site (Ti4+). We also study the solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) using AIMD to determine Li-coordination. Based on the properties computed using DFT and AIMD we propose that high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) might possess improved electrochemical performance over standard TSS-HS. Factors that could improve the performance of TSS-HE are 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-Oxygen), 3) Better electron mobility, 4) Wider operational voltage window, and 5) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggest that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of the semiclassical theory and the response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>

Abstract: It is commonly believed that the response theory can give quantum correction (or interband coherent effects) to the semiclassical theory, while both formulations essentially are perturbatively solving the time-dependent Sch\"odinger equation in a periodic potential probed by the electric field within the independent-particle approximation. Herein, by extending the semiclassical theory under an AC uniform electric field to the nonlinear regime, we show that up to the second order of the electric field, the AC semiclassical theory is equivalent to the response theory in the absence of relaxation. Remarkably, this equivalence can be inherited when the relaxation is incorporated into the response theory, particularly by taking the semiclassical results with a finite relaxation time obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation as a benchmark. ......</description>
