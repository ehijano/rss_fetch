      <title>Transversality for perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for the moduli space of perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds in a 6-dimensional manifold equipped with a generalization of a Calabi-Yau structure. These perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds arise as solutions to an infinite-dimensional Lagrange multipliers problem which is part of a proposal for counting special Lagrangians outlined by Donaldson and Segal in their paper Gauge theory in higher dimensions II. More specifically, we prove that this moduli space is generically a set of isolated points.</description>

      <title>Construction of almost K\"ahler solvmanifolds satisfying the hard-Lefschetz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$ is said to satisfy the hard-Lefschetz condition if it is possible to develop an analogue of Hodge theory for $(M, \omega)$. This loosely means that there is a notion of harmonicity of differential forms in $M$, depending on $\omega$ alone, such that every de Rham cohomology class in has a $\omega$-harmonic representative. In this article, we study two non-equivalent families of diagonal almost-abelian Lie algebras that admit a distinguished almost-K\"ahler structure and compute their cohomology explicitly. We show that they satisfy the hard-Lefschetz condition with respect to any left-invariant symplectic structure by exploiting an unforeseen connection with Kneser graphs. We also show that for some choice of parameters their associated simply connected, completely solvable Lie groups admit lattices, thereby constructing examples of almost-K\"ahler solvmanifolds satisfying the hard-Lefschetz condition, in such a way that their de Rham cohomology is fully known.</description>

      <title>Area-minimizing Hypersurfaces in Singular Ambient Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study area-minimizing hypersurfaces in singular ambient manifolds whose tangent cones have nonnegative scalar curvature on their regular parts. We prove that the singular set of the hypersurface has codimension at least 3 in our settings. We also give an example in which n-dimensional minimizing hypersurface in an ambient space as given above may have singularities of dimension $n-3$. This shows that our regularity result is sharp.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Generalised Spin$^r$ Spinors on Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt the characterisation of the spin representation via exterior forms to the generalised spin$^r$ context. We find new invariant spin$^r$ spinors on the projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^n$, $\mathbb{HP}^n$, and the Cayley plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$ for all their homogeneous realisations. Specifically, for each of these realisations, we provide a complete description of the space of invariant spin$^r$ for the minimum value of $r$ for which this space is non-zero. Additionally, we demonstrate some geometric implications of the existence of special spin$^r$ spinors on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal volume bound and volume growth for Ricci-nonnegative manifolds with positive Bi-Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the optimal volume growth for complete Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g)$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature everywhere and bi-Ricci curvature bounded from below by $n-2$ outside a compact set when the dimension is less than eight. This answers a question [AX24, Question 1] proposed by Antonelli-Xu in dimensions six and seven. As a by-product, we also prove an analogy of Gromov's volume bound conjecture [Gro86, Open Question 2.A.(b)] under the condition of positive bi-Ricci curvature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Abundance conjecture predicts that on a minimal projective klt pair $(X,\Delta)$, the adjoint divisor $K_X+\Delta$ is semiample. When $\chi(X,\mathcal O_X)\neq0$, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the conjecture to hold in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of multiplier ideals of currents with minimal singularities of small twists of $K_X+\Delta$. Furthermore, we prove fundamental structural properties as well as regularity and weak convergence behaviour of an important class of currents with minimal singularities: the supercanonical currents. The results of the paper indicate strongly that supercanonical currents are central to the completion of the proof of the Abundance conjecture for minimal klt pairs $(X,\Delta)$ with $\chi(X,\mathcal O_X)\neq0$.</description>

      <title>112 years of listening to Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1910, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz delved into the enigmatic Laplace eigenvalue equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, pondering to what extent the geometry in which one solves the equation can be recovered from knowledge of the eigenvalues. This equation, foundational in physics, puzzled scholars for decades due to its complexities when seeking a solution in an arbitrarily shaped bounded domain. Lorentz, inspired by physical and musical analogies, conjectured a fundamental relationship between eigenvalues, domain volume, and dimensionality. While his conjecture initially seemed insurmountable, Hermann Weyl's groundbreaking proof in 1912 illuminated the deep connection between eigenvalues and geometric properties. Over the ensuing 112 years, mathematicians and physicists have continued to listen to Riemannian manifolds, deciphering the intricate interplay between eigenvalues and geometry. From Weyl's law to Milnor's example of isospectral non-isometric flat tori, and Mark Kac's influential work, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, uncovering spectral invariants and advancing our understanding of geometric properties discernible through eigenvalues. This article offers a comprehensive survey of these developments, catering to both novices and experts alike. By elucidating key proofs and exploring diverse research niches, we trace the evolution of eigenvalue studies, culminating in a glimpse of the future directions this rich field may take.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>Boundary Detection Algorithm Inspired by Locally Linear Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of high-dimensional data, it is often assumed that the data set possesses an underlying lower-dimensional structure. A practical model for this structure is an embedded compact manifold with boundary. Since the underlying manifold structure is typically unknown, identifying boundary points from the data distributed on the manifold is crucial for various applications. In this work, we propose a method for detecting boundary points inspired by the widely used locally linear embedding algorithm. We implement this method using two nearest neighborhood search schemes: the $\epsilon$-radius ball scheme and the $K$-nearest neighbor scheme. This algorithm incorporates the geometric information of the data structure, particularly through its close relation with the local covariance matrix. We discuss the selection the key parameter and analyze the algorithm through our exploration of the spectral properties of the local covariance matrix in both neighborhood search schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the algorithm's performance with simulated examples.</description>

      <title>Curvature and Weitzenbock formula for the Podle\'{s} quantum sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is a unique Levi-Civita connection on the one-forms of the Dabrowski-Sitarz spectral triple for the Podle\'{s} sphere $S^{2}_{q}$. We compute the full curvature tensor, as well as the Ricci and scalar curvature of the Podle\'{s} sphere using the framework of \cite{MRLC}. The scalar curvature is a constant, and as the parameter $q\to 1$, the scalar curvature converges to the classical value $2$. We prove a generalised Weitzenbock formula for the spinor bundle, which differs from the classical Lichnerowicz formula for $q\neq 1$, yet recovers it for $q\to 1$.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a contribution to piecewise linear (PL) symplectic topology. We define the notion of PL symplectic manifold as being a combinatorial manifold endowed with a piecewise constant Whitney symplectic form and investigate possible relations between the two categories of symplectic spaces. We prove that smooth symplectic manifolds admit arbitrarily fine smooth triangulations in general position with respect to the symplectic form and can be $C^0$-approximated by PL symplectic manifolds. We cannot prove that smooth symplectic structures can be triangulated, except in trivial cases, but we can prove that their associated volume form can be triangulated by the volume form of some of these approximating PL manifolds.</description>

      <title>New examples of G$_2$-structures with divergence-free torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in Riemannian manifolds with holonomy equal to the exceptional Lie group $\mathrm{G}_2$ have spurred extensive research in geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures defined on seven-dimensional manifolds in recent years. Among many possible geometric flows, the so-called \textit{isometric flow} has the distinctive feature of preserving the underlying metric induced by that $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure, so it can be used to evolve a $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure to one with the smallest possible torsion in a given metric class. This flow is built upon the divergence of the full torsion tensor of the flowing $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures in such a way that its critical points are precisely $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with divergence-free torsion. In this article we study three large families of pairwise non-equivalent non-closed left-invariant $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures defined on simply connected solvable Lie groups previously studied in \cite{KL} and compute the divergence of their full torsion tensor, obtaining that it is identically zero in all cases.</description>

      <title>Frankel property and Maximum Principle at Infinity for complete minimal hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complete minimal hypersurfaces in Riemannian $n-$manifolds $\mathcal{M}^n$ for dimensions $4 \leq n \leq 7$, and we obtain some results in the spirit of known work for $n=3$.
  Key contributions include extending the work of Anderson and Rodr\'{i}guez to higher dimensions. Specifically, we show that in four-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature and positive scalar curvature, two disjoint properly embedded minimal hypersurfaces bound a slab isometric to the product of one hypersurface with an interval.
  Our results are grounded in a maximum principle at infinity for two-sided, parabolic, properly embedded minimal hypersurfaces in complete Riemannian manifolds of bounded geometry, generalizing the work of Mazet in dimension three to higher dimensions. We also leverage the recent classification of complete two-sided stable minimal hypersurfaces by Chodosh, Li, and Stryker.</description>

      <title>A construction of Einstein solvmanifolds not based on nilsolitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct indefinite Einstein solvmanifolds that are standard, but not of pseudo-Iwasawa type. Thus, the underlying Lie algebras take the form $\mathfrak{g}\rtimes_D\mathbb{R}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra and $D$ is a nonsymmetric derivation. Considering nonsymmetric derivations has the consequence that $\mathfrak{g}$ is not a nilsoliton, but satisfies a more general condition.
  Our construction is based on the notion of nondiagonal triple on a nice diagram. We present an algorithm to classify nondiagonal triples and the associated Einstein metrics. With the use of a computer, we obtain all solutions up to dimension $5$, and all solutions in dimension $\leq9$ that satisfy an additional technical restriction.
  By comparing curvatures, we show that the Einstein solvmanifolds of dimension $\leq 5$ that we obtain by our construction are not isometric to a standard extension of a nilsoliton.</description>

      <title>Singularities on maxfaces constructed by node-opening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The node-opening technique, originally designed for constructing minimal surfaces, is adapted to construct a rich variety of new maxfaces of high genus that are embedded outside a compact set and have arbitrarily many catenoid or planar ends, thus removing the scarcity of examples of maxfaces. The surfaces look like spacelike planes connected by small necks. Among the examples are maxfaces of the Costa--Hoffman--Meeks type. Although very fruitful, the main challenge of this paper is not the construction itself, but the analysis of the positions and natures of singularities on these maxfaces. More specifically, we conclude that the singular set form curves around the waists of the necks. In generic and some symmetric cases, all but finitely many singularities are cuspidal edges, and the non-cuspidal singularities are swallowtails evenly distributed along the singular curves.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Connes and Chamseddine defined a Hochschild cocycle in the general framework of noncommutative geometry. They computed this Hochschild cocycle for the Dirac operator on 4-dimensioanl manifolds. We propose a way to study the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle from the viewpoint of the noncommutative integral on 6-dimensional manifolds in this paper. We compute several interesting noncommutative integral defined in [8] by the normal coodinated way on n-dimensional manifolds. As a corollary, the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle on 6-dimensional manifolds is obtained.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves the polynomial equivalence of a broad class of definitions of quantum computational complexity. We study right-invariant metrics on the unitary group -- often called `complexity geometries' following the definition of quantum complexity proposed by Nielsen -- and delineate the equivalence class of metrics that have the same computational power as quantum circuits. Within this universality class, any unitary that can be reached in one metric can be approximated in any other metric in the class with a slowdown that is at-worst polynomial in the length and number of qubits and inverse-polynomial in the permitted error. We describe the equivalence classes for two different kinds of error we might tolerate: Killing-distance error, and operator-norm error. All metrics in both equivalence classes are shown to have exponential diameter; all metrics in the operator-norm equivalence class are also shown to give an alternative definition of the quantum complexity class BQP.
  My results extend those of Nielsen et al., who in 2006 proved that one particular metric is polynomially equivalent to quantum circuits. The Nielsen et al. metric is incredibly highly curved. I show that the greatly enlarged equivalence class established in this paper also includes metrics that have modest curvature. I argue that the modest curvature makes these metrics more amenable to the tools of differential geometry, and therefore makes them more promising starting points for Nielsen's program of using differential geometry to prove complexity lowerbounds.</description>

      <title>Topologies of maximally extended non-Hausdorff Misner Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misner (1967) space is a portion of 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, identified under a boost $\mathcal B$. It is well known that the maximal analytic extension of Misner space that is Hausdorff consists of one half of Minkowski spacetime, identified under $\mathcal B$; and Hawking and Ellis (1973) have shown that the maximal analytic extension that is non-Hausdorff is equal to the full Minkowski spacetime with the point $Q$ at the origin removed, identifed under $\mathcal B$. In this paper I show that, in fact, there is an infinite set of non-Hausdorff maximal analytic extensions, each with a different causal structure. The extension constructed by Hawking and Ellis is the simplest of these. Another extension is obtained by wrapping an infinite number of copies of Minkowski spacetime around the removed $Q$ as a helicoid or Riemann surface and then identifying events under the boost $\mathcal B$. The other extensions are obtained by wrapping some number $n$ of successive copies of Minkowski spacetime around the missing $Q$ as a helicoid, then identifying the end of the $n$'th copy with the beginning of the initial copy, and then identifying events under $\mathcal B$. I discuss the causal structure and covering spaces of each of these extensions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of optimization problems that are solvable iteratively with linear convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we state a general conjecture on the solvability of optimization problems via algorithms with linear convergence guarantees. We make a first step towards examining its correctness by fully characterizing the problems that are solvable via Riemannian gradient descent with linear convergence.</description>

      <title>A Heterotic K\"ahler Gravity and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In the process, we define a new type of symplectic cohomology theory, where the background complex structure Beltrami differential plays the role of the symplectic form.</description>
