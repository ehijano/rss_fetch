      <title>Random transverse and longitudinal field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental results on compounds like ${\rm LiHo}_x{\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm F}_4$, we consider an Ising chain with random bonds in the simultaneous presence of random transverse and longitudinal fields. We study the low-energy properties of the model at zero temperature by the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method.In the absence of random longitudinal fields, the model showcases a trivial quantum-ordered and quantum-disordered fixed-point and a non-trivial infinite disorder critical point. In the absence of random transverse fields, the behavior is dictated by the classical random-field Ising fixed-point. In the simultaneous presence of both a longitudinal and transverse random field, the RG trajectories are attracted to one of the two disordered fixed-points and the relevant scaling direction at the infinite disorder fixed-point is along the separatrix, where the correlation-length is shown to diverge with an exponent $\nu_h \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.</description>

      <title>Topological insights into dense frictional suspension rheology: Third order loops drive discontinuous shear thickening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions exhibit significant viscosity changes under external deformation, a phenomenon known as shear thickening. Recent studies have identified a stress-induced transition from lubricated, unconstrained interactions to frictional contacts, which play a crucial role in shear thickening. This work investigates the rheological behavior and contact network evolution during continuous and discontinuous shear thickening (CST and DST) in two-dimensional simulations. We find that at low stress, during weak thickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains along the compression axis. With increasing stress, the contact network becomes more isotropic, and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops within the frictional contact network are key to this behavior. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the number of edges in the third-order loops and the viscosity of the suspension. Notably, this relationship remains independent of the packing fraction, applied stress, and interparticle friction, highlighting the fundamental role of the mesoscale network topology in governing macroscopic rheology.</description>

      <title>Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass: role of non-affine flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effect reflects a system's ability to encode, retain and retrieve information about its past. Such effects are essentially an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon providing insight into the complex structural and dynamical behavior of the system. Kovacs effect is one such memory effect that is traditionally associated with thermal history. Although studies on the Kovacs-like memory effect have been extended to mechanical perturbations such as compression-decompression, whether such effects can also be observed under volume-conserving perturbations like shear, remains unclear. Combining experiments, simulations and linear response theory we demonstrate Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass. Moreover, we explore the influence of non-linear perturbations and establish a correlation between the deviation from linear response prediction and microscopic non-affine flows generated due to such large deformations in affecting the memory effect. Our study not only extends Kovacs-like memory effect in the domain of volume-conserving mechanical perturbations, it also highlights the importance of the nature of underlying microscopic flows in controlling the memory effect in amorphous matter.</description>

      <title>Surfacic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>

      <title>Universal classes of disorder scatterings in in-plane anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) with planar Hall current and magnetization/magnetic fields in various quantum materials has received increasing attentions. Most of current efforts are devoted to the intrinsic part due to the Berry curvature of electronic bands, however, how the disorder scatterings affect the extrinsic part (skew scattering and side jump) still remains largely elusive. Here we theoretically investigated the three universal classes of disorder scatterings (scalar, spin-conserving and spin-flipping) on the IPAHE based on the prototypical two-dimensional massive Dirac fermion model with warping term under generic Zeeman fields. We find the different disorder scatterings result in distinct dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity on disorder strength and recover previous known results in some limits. Remarkably, the spin-flipping scattering could give rise to nontrivial contributions featuring sinusoidal oscillation with periods of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ to the extrinsic part, in contrast to the standard two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. Our work unveils the rich features of anomalous transport in planar Hall geometry in the presence of disorder scatterings and provides some useful insights into the magnetotransport phenomena.</description>

      <title>A self-learning magnetic Hopfield neural network with intrinsic gradient descent adaption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources.Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>
