      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Corporate Bond Trading: A Sell Side Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A corporate bond trader in a typical sell side institution such as a bank provides liquidity to the market participants by buying/selling securities and maintaining an inventory. Upon receiving a request for a buy/sell price quote (RFQ), the trader provides a quote by adding a spread over a \textit{prevalent market price}. For illiquid bonds, the market price is harder to observe, and traders often resort to available benchmark bond prices (such as MarketAxess, Bloomberg, etc.). In \cite{Bergault2023ModelingLI}, the concept of \textit{Fair Transfer Price} for an illiquid corporate bond was introduced which is derived from an infinite horizon stochastic optimal control problem (for maximizing the trader's expected P\&amp;L, regularized by the quadratic variation). In this paper, we consider the same optimization objective, however, we approach the estimation of an optimal bid-ask spread quoting strategy in a data driven manner and show that it can be learned using Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, we perform extensive outcome analysis to examine the reasonableness of the trained agent's behavior.</description>

      <title>Death, Taxes, and Inequality. Can a Minimal Model Explain Real Economic Inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Income inequalities and redistribution policies are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. The model is scaled to match human lifespans and overall death rates. Stochastic income distributions from the model are compared to empirical data from actual economies. Empirical data are fit to implied distributions providing necessary resolution for comparison. The impacts of redistribution policies on total wealth, income distributions, and inequality are shown to be similar for the empirical data and the model. These comparisons enable detailed determinations of population welfare beyond what is possible with total wealth and inequality metrics. Estate taxes in the model appear quite effective in reducing inequality without reducing total wealth. Significant income inequality emerges for the model for a population of equally capable individuals presented with equal opportunities. Stochastic population instability at both the high and low ends of infertility are considered.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>
