      <title>Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching with Domain Alignment for Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users increasingly interact with content across multiple domains, resulting in sequential behaviors marked by frequent and complex transitions. While Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions, Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more domain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and imbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain transitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones, and struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases. We propose \textit{GMFlowRec}, an efficient generative framework for MDSR that models domain-aware transition trajectories via Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching. GMFlowRec integrates: (1) a unified dual-masked Transformer to disentangle domain-invariant and domain-specific intents, (2) a Gaussian Mixture flow field to capture diverse behavioral patterns, and (3) a domain-aligned prior to support frequent and sparse transitions. Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon datasets demonstrate that GMFlowRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 44\% improvement in NDCG@5, while maintaining high efficiency via a single unified backbone, making it scalable for real-world multi-domain sequential recommendation.</description>

      <title>Communication Platform for Non-verbal Autistic children in Oman using Android mobile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder. It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through interactive screen-based activities.</description>

      <title>VOGUE: A Multimodal Dataset for Conversational Recommendation in Fashion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories, and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level Optimization for Generative Recommendation: Bridging Tokenization and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching. Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.</description>

      <title>Pctx: Tokenizing Personalized Context for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency, scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs. This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/YoungZ365/Pctx.</description>

      <title>CausalRec: A CausalBoost Attention Model for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors, leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating more accurate and reliable recommendations.</description>

      <title>SciNUP: Natural Language User Interest Profiles for Scientific Literature Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations. However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items, indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable resource for fostering future research and development in this area.</description>

      <title>Doc-Researcher: A Unified System for Multimodal Document Parsing and Deep Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts, and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158 expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents, M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess. Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document collections.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Multilingual E-Commerce Product Search: Case Study on Query-Category and Query-Item Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3) self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances. Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.</description>

      <title>From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.</description>

      <title>Redefining Retrieval Evaluation in the Era of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR, assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality, rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility, classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment of RAG components</description>

      <title>DeepAgent: A General Reasoning Agent with Scalable Toolsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</description>

      <title>AcuRank: Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Computation for Listwise Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based reranking models.</description>

Abstract: Progress in conversational information access (CIA) systems has been hindered by the difficulty of evaluating such systems with reproducible experiments. While user simulation offers a promising solution, the lack of infrastructure and tooling to support this evaluation paradigm remains a significant barrier. To address this gap, we introduce SimLab, the first cloud-based platform providing a centralized solution for the community to benchmark both conversational systems and user simulators in a controlled and reproducible setting. We articulate the requirements for such a platform and propose a general infrastructure to meet them. We then present the design and implementation of an initial version of SimLab and showcase its features through an initial simulation-based evaluation task in conversational movie recommendation. Furthermore, we discuss the platform's sustainability and future opportunities for development, inviting the community to drive further progress in the fields of CIA and user simulation.</description>

      <title>Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs</title>

Abstract: Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).
  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925</link>

Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.</description>

      <title>Rank-GRPO: Training LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.</description>
