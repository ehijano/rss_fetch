      <title>Non-Fermi liquid transport and strong mass enhancement near the nematic quantum critical point in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is often accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, which emerges near a quantum critical point (QCP) - a point where an electronic ordered phase is terminated at absolute zero under non-thermal parameters. While nematic orders, characterized by broken rotational symmetry, are sometimes found in unconventional superconductors, the role of nematic fluctuations in driving NFL transport behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated electrical and thermoelectric transport properties in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films and observed hallmark NFL behavior: temperature-linear resistivity and logarithmic divergence of thermoelectricity at low temperatures. Notably, the thermoelectricity peaks sharply at the nematic QCP ($x$ = 0.45), highlighting the dominant role of nematic fluctuations in the NFL transport. Furthermore, we found that the pair-breaking mechanisms in the superconducting phase crosses over from orbital- to Pauli-limited effects, indicating the mass enhancement near the nematic critical regime. These findings reveal the profound impact of nematic fluctuations on both normal-state transport and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational function approximation made simple: A fast analytic continuation method for Matsubara Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuation is a critical step in quantum many-body computations, connecting imaginary-time or Matsubara Green's functions with real-frequency spectral functions, which can be directly compared to experimental results. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problems, they have not been completely solved so far. In this paper, we suggest a simple, yet highly efficient method for analytic continuations of Matsubara Green's functions. This method takes advantage of barycentric rational functions to directly interpolate Matsubara Green's functions. At first, the nodes and weights of the barycentric rational functions are determined by the adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm, avoiding reliance on the non-convex optimization. Next, the retarded Green's functions and the relatively spectral functions are evaluated by the resulting interpolants. We systematically explore the performance of this method through a series of toy models and realistic examples, comparing its accuracy and efficiency with other popular methods, such as the maximum entropy method. The benchmark results demonstrate that the new method can accurately reproduce not only continuous but also discrete spectral functions, irrespective of their positive definiteness. It works well even in the presence of intermediate noise, and outperforms traditional analytic continuation methods in computational speed. We believe that this method should stand out for its robustness against noise, broad applicability, high precision, and ultra efficiency, offering a promising alternative to the maximum entropy method.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic transport properties and topological Hall effect in the annealed kagome antiferromagnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation often gives birth to various orders in quantum materials. Recently, a strongly correlated kagome antiferromagnet FeGe is discovered to undergo a charge density wave transition inside the A-type antiferromagnetic state, providing an opportunity to explore the interplay between charge order and magnetism. Here, we reported the observation of anisotropic resistivity and Hall effect, along with a topological Hall effect, in the annealed FeGe crystals. As the current flows along the \emph{ab}-plane, the temperature dependence of $\rho_{ab}$ exhibits a distinct resistivity loop related to a first-order transition at $T_{cdw}$. The applied magnetic fields do not alter $T_{cdw}$ but can induce a spin-flop transition at $H_{sf}$. Consequently, a field-induced large topological Hall effect is observed in the canting antiferromagnetic (CAFM) state below $T_{cant}$, which is possibly attributed to the non-trivial spin texture during the spin-flop process. Whereas, as current is parallel to \emph{c}-axis, both the field-induced transitions in $\rho_{c}$ and $\chi_{c}$ disappear. Instead, the Hall resistivity in the annealed FeGe significantly exhibits a deviation from the linear field-dependent. These findings provide valuable insight into revealing the interplay among magnetism, charge order and topology in the kagome magnets.</description>

      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for self-consistent vertex corrected GW with static and dynamic screening; applications to molecules and solids with superexchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For molecules and solids, we developed efficient MPI-parallel algorithms for evaluating the second-order exchange term with bare, statically screened, and dynamically screened interactions. We employ the resulting term in a fully self-consistent manner together with scGW, resulting in the following vertex-corrected scGW schemes: scGWSOX, scGWSOSEX, scGW2SOSEX, and scG3W2theories. We show that for the vertex evaluation, the reduction of scaling by tensor hypercontraction (THC) has two limiting execution regimes. We used the resulting code to perform the largest (by the number of orbitals) fully self-consistent calculations with the SOX term. We demonstrate that our procedure allows for a reliable evaluation of even small energy differences. Utilizing a broken-symmetry approach, we explore the influence of the SOX term on the effective magnetic exchange couplings. We show that the treatment of SOX has a significant impact on the obtained values of the effective exchange constants, which we explain through a self-energy dependence on an effective dielectric constant. We confirm this explanation by analyzing natural orbitals and local changes in charge transfer quantifying superexchange. Our analysis explains the structure of weak electron correlation responsible for the modulation of superexchange in both molecules and solids. Finally, for solids, we evaluate Neel temperatures utilizing the high-temperature expansion and compare the results obtained with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Strong pair-density-wave fluctuations in an exactly solvable doped Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice, which describes both a Mott insulator at half-filling and a non-Fermi liquid phase on doping. Through the solution of this exactly solvable model with the inclusion of pairing interactions, we demonstrate the emergence of strong pair-density-wave (PDW) fluctuations associated with center-of-mass momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(\pi,\pi)$ at finite temperatures for low dopings up to a critical doping and intermediate $U$ interaction. Furthermore, we also confirm that a superconducting instability appears in the model within a wide regime of interaction $U$ and doping parameter $x$. In view of the fact that it has been recently put forward that the metal-insulator transition of the HK model belongs to the same universality class as the Mott transition of the paradigmatic Hubbard model [Huang \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. \textbf{18}, 511 (2022)], our work may thus shed light on an interesting scenario regarding the emergence of a fluctuating PDW phase on doping a Mott insulator, which has been argued to be relevant for understanding the physics of the cuprate superconductors in the underdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Emergent Intermediate Phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model from Tensor Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model on a square lattice using a tensor network approach designed for frustrated spin systems. This model, characterized by competing nearest-neighbor and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, exhibits a complex interplay between $U(1)$ and $Z_2$ symmetries. Our study reveals an emergent intermediate phase around $J_2/J_1 \sim 0.505$, which is characterized by a $Z_2$ long-range stripe order without phase coherence in the XY spins. The intermediate phase features two well-separated phase transitions: a higher-temperature Ising transition and a lower-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The relative separation between these transitions is significantly larger than previously reported, enabling a clearer investigation of their distinct thermodynamic properties. For $0.5&lt;J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.501$, two transitions merge into a single first-order phase transition, a phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by mapping to the Ising-XY model. As $J_2/J_1 \to \infty$, the transition evolves continuously into the BKT universality class. These findings advance the understanding of the mechanisms driving phase transitions in frustrated spin systems and suggest potential experimental realizations in platforms such as ultracold atoms, Josephson junction arrays, and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Ferroelectricity in the Mott Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been one major focus in modern fundamental research and technological application. We consider the physical origin of improper ferroelectricity in Mott insulating materials. Beyond the well-known Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the noncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric polarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire the reexamination of the ferroelectricity among the multipolar-ordered magnets.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the magnetic and electronic complexity of intermetallic ErPd$_2$Si$_2$: Anisotropic thermal expansion, phase transitions, and twofold magnetotransport behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the physical properties of intermetallic ErPd$_2$Si$_2$, a compound renowned for its intriguing magnetic and electronic characteristics. We confirm the tetragonal crystal structure of ErPd$_2$Si$_2$ within the $I4/mmm$ space group. Notably, we observed anisotropic thermal expansion, with the lattice constant $a$ expanding and $c$ contracting between 15 K and 300 K. This behavior is attributed to lattice vibrations and electronic contributions. Heat capacity measurements revealed three distinct temperature regimes: $T_1 \sim 3.0$ K, $T_\textrm{N} \sim 4.20$ K, and $T_2 \sim 15.31$ K. These correspond to the disappearance of spin-density waves, the onset of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure, and the crystal-field splitting and/or the presence of short-range spin fluctuations, respectively. Remarkably, the AFM phase transition anomaly was observed exclusively in low-field magnetization data (120 Oe) at $T_\textrm{N}$. A high magnetic field ($B =$ 3 T) effectively suppressed this anomaly, likely due to spin-flop and spin-flip transitions. Furthermore, the extracted effective PM moments closely matched the expected theoretical value, suggesting a dominant magnetic contribution from localized 4$f$ spins of Er. Additionally, significant differences in resistance ($R$) values at low temperatures under applied $B$ indicated a magnetoresistance (MR) effect with a minimum value of -4.36\%. Notably, the measured MR effect exhibited anisotropic behavior, where changes in the strength or direction of the applied $B$ induced variations in the MR effect. A twofold symmetry of $R$ was discerned at 3 T and 9 T, originating from the orientation of spin moments relative to the applied $B$. Intriguingly, above $T_\textrm{N}$, short-range spin fluctuations also displayed a preferred orientation along the $c$-axis due to single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Role of phonon coupling in driving photo-excited Mott insulators towards a transient superconducting steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding light-induced hidden orders is relevant for nonequilibrium materials control and future ultrafast technologies. Hidden superconducting order, in particular, has been a focus of recent experimental and theoretical efforts. In this study, we investigate the stability of light-induced $\eta$ pairing. Using a memory truncated implementation of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and entropy cooling techniques, we study the long-time dynamics of the photoinduced superconducting state. In the presence of coupling to a cold phonon bath, the photodoped system reaches a quasi-steady state, which can be sustained over a long period of time in large-gap Mott insulators. We show that this long-lived prethermalized state is well described by the nonequilibrium steady state implementation of DMFT.</description>

      <title>The light-matter correlation energy functional of the cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas via quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform extensive simulations of the two-dimensional cavity-coupled electron gas in a modulating potential as a minimal model for cavity quantum materials. These simulations are enabled by a newly developed quantum-electrodynamical (QED) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We present a procedure to greatly reduce finite-size effects in such calculations. Based on our results, we show that a modified version of weak-coupling perturbation theory is remarkably accurate for a large parameter region. We further provide a simple parameterization of the light-matter correlation energy as a functional of the cavity parameters and the electronic density. These results provide a numerical foundation for the development of the QED density functional theory, which was previously reliant on analytical approximations, to allow quantitative modeling of a wide range of systems with light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Novel magnetic Ni-N-Ni centers in N-substituted NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19250v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the concept of creating individual centers, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Concealed Mott Criticality: Unifying the Kondo Breakdown and Doped Charge-Transfer Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that the quantum critical points observed in heavy fermions (the `Kondo breakdown') and in doped cuprates can be understood in terms of concealed Mott criticality. In this picture, one species of electrons undergoes a Mott localization transition, in the presence of metallic charge carries. As is shown in a simple toy model, this results in a Fermi surface jump at the transition, as well as mass enhancement on both the `large' and `small' Fermi surface side of the transition, consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-semisimple, non-invertible symmetry on spin chains, whose topological defects encode the category of modules over the Taft algebra of dimension 4. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify an $\mathbb{S}^1$-parametrised family of symmetric states, all of which belong to the same gapped phase with respect to the invertible subsymmetry, yet transform inequivalently under the non-semisimple symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are associated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively, in a non-semisimple module category.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>Wannier states and spin supersolid physics in the triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combination of ultra-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and Monte Carlo numerical simulations to study the thermodynamics and the structure of spin excitations in the spin-supersolid phase of the triangular lattice XXZ easy axis antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ and its evolution in a magnetic field. BKT transitions heralding the onset of Ising and supersolid order are detected. Above the supersolid phase the value of Wannier entropy is experimentally recovered. At low temperatures, with an experimental resolution of about 23 $\mu$eV, no discrete coherent magnon modes are resolved within a broad continuum of scattering. In addition to gapless excitations, a pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small energy gap of 0.06 meV is found. A second excitation continuum is seen at higher energy, in place of single-spin-flip excitations of the Ising model. In applied fields the continuum gradually morphs into coherent spin waves, with the Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone sectors showing distinct evolution. The agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is excellent on the quantitative level.</description>

      <title>Signature of T$_\textrm{c}$ above 111 K in Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 superconductors: synergistic nature of hole concentration, coherence length and Josephson interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the bottleneck to drive higher critical transition temperature $T_\textrm{c}$ plays a pivotal role in the underlying study of superconductors. We systematically investigate the effect of Li$^+$ substitution for Cu$^{2+}$ cations on the $T_\textrm{c}$, hole concentration, coherence length and interlayer coupling, and microstructure in Li-doped Bi$_{1.6}$Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10 + \delta}$ or (Bi,Pb)-2223 compound. Remarkably, we demonstrate by utilizing a long-time sintering accompanied by a multiple recurrent intermediate stages of calcining and pressing within our renovated solid-state reaction method, the optimal Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 samples achieve the well-enhanced $T_\textrm{c}$ of 111--113.8 K compared with the standard value of 110 K. We evince the superconducting mechanism that the substitution of Li$^{+}$ for Cu$^{2+}$ ions on the CuO$_2$ layers causes augmenting the hole concentrations and promotes the correlation between the overdoped outer and the underdoped inner CuO$_2$ planes, and thus effects improve $T_\textrm{c}$. Following a universal quadratic relation between $T_\textrm{c}$ and hole concentration, a new higher optimal hole concentration is provided. Additionally, by analyzing the Aslamazov-Larkin and Lawrence-Doniach theories on the reliable excess conductivity data near the critical temperature, we observe the strong effect of Li-doping on the system. The coherence length steadily increases versus the Li-doped content, while the Josephson interlayer coupling strength between the CuO$_2$ layers almost remains a constant for the whole series of Li-doping. Our findings establish an insightful roadmap to improve the critical temperature and intrinsic superconducting properties in the Bi-2223 compounds through the doping process.</description>

      <title>Topological Constraints on Defect Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended objects (defects) in Quantum Field Theory exhibit rich, nontrivial dynamics describing a variety of physical phenomena. These systems often involve strong coupling at long distances, where the bulk and defects interact, making analytical studies challenging. By carefully analyzing the behavior of bulk symmetries in the presence of defects, we uncover robust topological constraints on defect RG flows. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $\textit{defect anomalies}$ and $\textit{strongly symmetric defects}$, both of which are RG-invariant. Several known notions, such as higher-form symmetries, fractionalization, and projective lines, are revealed to be manifestations of defect anomalies, which also encompass novel phenomena and forbid trivial defect dynamics in the IR. Meanwhile, strongly symmetric defects are shown to remain coupled at low energies, imposing powerful dynamical constraints. We verify our findings through concrete examples: exactly solvable defect RG flows in (1+1)d Conformal Field Theories with strongly symmetric lines and a surface defect in (2+1)d scalar QED.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Derandomized shallow shadows: Efficient Pauli learning with bounded-depth circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating large numbers of non-commuting observables is an important subroutine of many quantum science tasks. We present the derandomized shallow shadows (DSS) algorithm for efficiently learning a large set of non-commuting observables, using shallow circuits to rotate into measurement bases. Exploiting tensor network techniques to ensure polynomial scaling of classical resources, our algorithm outputs a set of shallow measurement circuits that approximately minimizes the sample complexity of estimating a given set of Pauli strings. We numerically demonstrate systematic improvement, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, for energy estimation of quantum chemistry benchmarks and verification of quantum many-body systems, and we observe DSS's performance consistently improves as one allows deeper measurement circuits. These results indicate that in addition to being an efficient, low-depth, stand-alone algorithm, DSS can also benefit many larger quantum algorithms requiring estimation of multiple non-commuting observables.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19566v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems: from dynamical localization to slow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>A local automaton for the 2D toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Possible Realization of Kitaev Spin Liquids in van der Waals Heterostructures of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Cr$X_3$ ($X$=Cl and I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the presence of the exact solution and well-established recipe for its realization, the quest for the Kitaev spin liquid in real materials remains exceptionally challenging. Among many magnets, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ emerges as a prime candidate, albeit the hallmarks of the spin liquid manifest only within the specific region where the zigzag-type antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by an applied magnetic field. Here, we propose the possible realization of the Kitaev spin liquid at zero field by making van der Waals heterostructures of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and a ferromagnet Cr$X_3$ ($X$=Cl and I). Using {\it ab initio} calculations, we find that in the case of $X$=Cl the zigzag order is suppressed by the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic CrCl$_3$ layer, while the Kitaev interaction is still relevant in the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layer. Notably, the induced Ru moment is close to the value observed in the spin liquid region of the bulk material, signifying the possibility of the Kitaev spin liquid at zero field. In contrast, in the case of $X$=I, the system is on the verge of an insulator-metal transition by carrier doping through interlayer hybridization. Our results indicate that van der Waals heterostructures provide a new platform for studying not only magnetic but also electronic properties of the Kitaev magnets.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Theories for charge-driven nematicity in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a low-energy continuum model for the band dispersion of the $2 \times 2$ charge-ordered phase of the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs), we show that nematicity can develop in this state driven either by three inequivalent $1 \times 4$ charge fluctuations preemptive of a $1 \times 4$ charge order (CO), or by an actual zero momentum $d$-wave charge Pomeranchuk instability (PI). We perform a Kohn-Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole sector, which allows us to establish a criterion for the development of an attractive nematic channel near the onset of the $1 \times 4$ CO and near the $d$-wave charge PI, respectively. We derive an effective charge-fermion model for the $d$-wave PI with a nematic susceptibility given via a random phase approximation (RPA) summation. By contrast, for the finite momentum CO, the RPA scheme breaks down and needs to be improved upon by including Aslamazov-Larkin contributions to the nematic pairing vertex. We then move to the derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau potentials for the $1 \times 4$ CO and for the $d$-wave PI, and we obtain the corresponding analytical expression for the nematic susceptibility at the nematic transition temperature T $ \sim \text{T}_\text{nem}$ in both cases. Our work establishes a relation between the nematicity observed in some of the iron-based superconductors, where the nematic phase might be driven by spin fluctuations, and the vanadium-based kagome metals, where charge fluctuations likely induce nematicity. The two microscopic mechanisms we propose for the stabilization of the nematic state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ are distinguishable by diffusive scattering experiments, meaning that it is possible to gauge which of the two theories, if any, is the most likely to describe this phase. Both mechanisms might also be relevant for the recently discovered titanium-based family $A$Ti$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous, spin, and valley Hall effects in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices have observed the quantum anomalous Hall effect at moir\'e filling factor of $\nu = 1$ and various fractional values. These phenomena are attributed to a flat Chern band induced by electron-electron interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that at $\nu = 2$, many-body effects can lead to the emergence of quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall states, in addition to the quantum anomalous Hall state, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling or valley-dependent potentials. These three topological states can be selectively induced by the application and manipulation of a magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that at $\nu = 3$ and $4$, the ground state can be a combination of topologically trivial and nontrivial states, unlike the cases of $\nu=1$ and 2. This contrasts with the conventional quantum Hall effect in graphene where the ground state at filling factor $\nu$ is given as the particle-hole counterpart at $4-\nu$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling behavior of the two-dimensional random singlet state in the random $Q$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the scaling relation of energy and length scales in the 2D random-singlet (RS) state of the random $Q$ model. To investigate the intrinsic energy scale of the spinon subsystem arising from the model, we develop a constrained subspace update algorithm within the framework of the stochastic series expansion method (SSE) to extract the singlet-triplet gap of the system. The 2D RS state exhibits scaling behavior similar to the infinite randomness fixed point (IRFP), at least within the length scales that we simulate. Furthermore, by rescaling the system size according to the strength of randomness, we observe that the data for the excitation gap and the width of the gap distribution collapse onto a single curve. This implies that the model with different strengths of randomness may correspond to the same fixed point.</description>

      <title>Dipole representation of composite fermions in graphene's quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport, characterized by its direction-selective nature, holds significant potential for applications in various devices. In this study, we investigate nonreciprocal heat transport in Majorana systems, specifically focusing on the Kitaev chiral spin liquid under external magnetic fields. Our theoretical examination focuses on effects of open boundaries in which the Majorana edge modes exist, and the inversion symmetry is broken, which leads to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Through perturbation theory, we demonstrate that DMI induces asymmetric hopping, resulting in the asymmetry of the Majorana band. The results of nonreciprocal heat currents are presented for various directions of external magnetic fields, and we discuss the relation between the current and the field-directions. The potential exists to manipulate both of the directions and magnitude of the nonreciprocal current by varying external magnetic fields and apply to heat transfer devices.</description>

      <title>Competing Orbital Magnetism and Superconductivity in electrostatically defined Josephson Junctions of Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle-point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$ function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <title>Using a Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm to Analyze the Critical Properties of the ANNNI Model Without Classical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of the Anisotropic Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using a feedback-based quantum algorithm (FQA). We demonstrate how this algorithm enables the computation of both ground and excited states without relying on classical optimization methods. By exploiting symmetries in the algorithm initialization, we show how targeted initial states can increase convergence and facilitate the study of excited states. Using this approach, we study the quantum phase transitions with the Finite Size Scaling method, analyze correlation functions through spin correlations in the ground state, and examine magnetic structure by calculating structure factors via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Our findings highlight FQA's potential as a versatile tool for studying not only the ANNNI model but also other quantum systems, providing insights into quantum phase transitions and the magnetic properties of complex spin models.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>

      <title>Doping evolution of the normal state magnetic excitations in pressurized La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The doping evolution behaviors of the normal state magnetic excitations (MEs) of the nickelate La3Ni2O7 are theoretically studied in this paper. For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of spin dynamics in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a specific limit of the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian with complex interactions. In this framework, fermions with different spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species, resulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$ interaction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical limit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian interactions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the system's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of decoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial conditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with decoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary interactions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature limit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we observe the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady state. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify signatures of anomalous spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the crystal structure of a bilayer nickel-oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis on the occurrence of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>The boundary entropy function for interface conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</description>
