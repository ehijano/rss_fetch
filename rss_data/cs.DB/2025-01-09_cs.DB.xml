      <title>Partition Constraints for Conjunctive Queries: Bounds and Worst-Case Optimal Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, various works have used statistics on relations to improve both the theory and practice of conjunctive query execution. Starting with the AGM bound which took advantage of relation sizes, later works incorporated statistics like functional dependencies and degree constraints. Each new statistic prompted work along two lines; bounding the size of conjunctive query outputs and worst-case optimal join algorithms. In this work, we continue in this vein by introducing a new statistic called a \emph{partition constraint}. This statistic captures latent structure within relations by partitioning them into sub-relations which each have much tighter degree constraints. We show that this approach can both refine existing cardinality bounds and improve existing worst-case optimal join algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Algorithms for Multi-way Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cloud databases, cloud computation over sensitive data uploaded by clients inevitably causes concern about data security and privacy. Even when encryption primitives and trusted computing environments are integrated into query processing to safeguard the actual contents of the data, access patterns of algorithms can still leak private information about the data. Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) and circuits are two generic approaches to address this issue, ensuring that access patterns of algorithms remain oblivious to the data. However, deploying these methods on insecure algorithms, particularly for multi-way join processing, is computationally expensive and inherently challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm for multi-way join processing that operates without relying on ORAM simulations or other security assumptions. Our algorithm is a non-trivial, provably oblivious composition of basic primitives, with time complexity matching the insecure worst-case optimal join algorithm, up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, it is cache-agnostic, with cache complexity matching the insecure lower bound, also up to a logarithmic factor. This clean and straightforward approach has the potential to be extended to other security settings and implemented in practical database systems.</description>

      <title>Keyword Search in the Deep Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Web is constituted by data that are accessible through Web pages, but not readily indexable by search engines as they are returned in dynamic pages. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for answering keyword queries on Deep Web sources represented as relational tables with so-called access limitations. We formalize the notion of optimal answer, characterize queries for which an answer can be found, and present a method for query processing based on the construction of a query plan that minimizes the accesses to the data sources.</description>

      <title>A Histologic Dataset of Normal and Atypical Mitotic Figures on Human Breast Cancer (AMi-Br)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of the density of mitotic figures (MFs) in histologic tumor sections is an important prognostic marker for many tumor types, including breast cancer. Recently, it has been reported in multiple works that the quantity of MFs with an atypical morphology (atypical MFs, AMFs) might be an independent prognostic criterion for breast cancer. AMFs are an indicator of mutations in the genes regulating the cell cycle and can lead to aberrant chromosome constitution (aneuploidy) of the tumor cells. To facilitate further research on this topic using pattern recognition, we present the first ever publicly available dataset of atypical and normal MFs (AMi-Br). For this, we utilized two of the most popular MF datasets (MIDOG 2021 and TUPAC) and subclassified all MFs using a three expert majority vote. Our final dataset consists of 3,720 MFs, split into 832 AMFs (22.4%) and 2,888 normal MFs (77.6%) across all 223 tumor cases in the combined set. We provide baseline classification experiments to investigate the consistency of the dataset, using a Monte Carlo cross-validation and different strategies to combat class imbalance. We found an averaged balanced accuracy of up to 0.806 when using a patch-level data set split, and up to 0.713 when using a patient-level split.</description>

      <title>MedPix 2.0: A Comprehensive Multimodal Biomedical Data set for Advanced AI Applications with Retrieval Augmented Generation and Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in large multimodal models (LMM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding CT or MRI scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning LMMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a RAG-based LMM trained using MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub. \url{https://github.com/CHILab1/MedPix-2.0}</description>
