      <title>Stylized facts in money markets: an empirical analysis of the eurozone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the secured transactions recorded within the Money Markets Statistical Reporting database of the European Central Bank, we test several stylized facts regarding interbank market of the 47 largest banks in the eurozone. We observe that the surge in the volume of traded evergreen repurchase agreements followed the introduction of the LCR regulation and we measure a rate of collateral re-use consistent with the literature. Regarding the topology of the interbank network, we confirm the high level of network stability but observe a higher density and a higher in- and out-degree symmetry than what is reported for unsecured markets.</description>

      <title>TIMeSynC: Temporal Intent Modelling with Synchronized Context Encodings for Financial Service Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Users engage with financial services companies through multiple channels, often interacting with mobile applications, web platforms, call centers, and physical locations to service their accounts. The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encode-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications. Our experiments show significant improvement over the existing tabular method.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Finance: Impact on Financial Services and required DeFi Literacy in 2034</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential future impact of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the financial services industry and the competencies financial professionals will require in a decade from now, in 2034. Using a survey of 109 experts from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies, the research highlights growing confidence in DeFi's potential to reshape critical areas such as risk management and operations. Over 40% of respondents anticipate high levels of DeFi adoption by 2034. However, the study identifies critical issues that need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of data management &amp; privacy, and security. These concerns, alongside regulatory challenges, underscore the need for financial institutions to prepare carefully. The findings also suggest that strategic competencies, sector-specific domain expertise, and technological skills will become increasingly vital. The insights offered are valuable for regulators, policymakers, and industry professionals, emphasizing the need for continuous upskilling to remain competitive in an evolving financial services landscape.</description>
