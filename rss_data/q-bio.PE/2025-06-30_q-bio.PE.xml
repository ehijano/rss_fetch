      <title>Ecosystems as adaptive living circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike many physical nonequilibrium systems, in biological systems, the coupling to external energy sources is not a fixed parameter but adaptively controlled by the system itself. We do not have theoretical frameworks that allow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent behavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive coevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a framework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the energy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional nonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from equilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical driving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that saves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the adaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking any global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal dissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work establishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose structure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules.</description>

      <title>Time-varying ecological interactions characterise equilibrium and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecological communities are composed of species interactions that respond to environmental fluctuations. Despite increasing evidence of temporal variation in these interactions, most theoretical frameworks remain rooted in static assumptions. Here, we develop and apply a time-varying network model to five long-term ecological datasets spanning diverse taxa and environments. Using a generalized Lotka-Volterra framework with environmental covariates, we quantify temporal rewiring of interspecific interactions, asymmetry patterns, and structural stability. Our results reveal contrasting dynamics across ecosystems: in datasets with rich temporal resolution, interaction networks exhibit marked rewiring and shifts in cooperation-competition ratios that correlate with environmental stress, consistent, though not always linearly, with the stress-gradient hypothesis. Conversely, in datasets with coarser temporal sampling, networks retain constant interaction sign structure and remain in cooperation-dominated regimes. These findings highlight the importance of temporal resolution and environmental context in shaping ecological coexistence.</description>

      <title>Vegetation Patterning Can Both Impede and Trigger Critical Transitions from Savanna to Grassland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel ''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.</description>

      <title>Estimation of rates in population-age-dependent processes by means of test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop practical applications of the model for the highly technical measure-valued populations developed by the authors in \cite{FanEtal20}. We consider the problem of estimation of parameters in the general age and population-dependent model, in which the individual birth and death rates depend not only on the age of the individual but also on the whole population composition. We derive new estimators of the rates based on the use of test functions in the functional Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for populations with a large carrying capacity. We consider the rates to be simple functions, that take finitely many values both in age $x$ and measure $A$, which leads to systems of linear equations. The proposed method of using test functions for estimation is a radically new approach which can be applied to a wide range of models of dynamical systems.</description>
