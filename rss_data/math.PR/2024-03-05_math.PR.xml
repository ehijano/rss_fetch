      <title>Mixing of fast random walks on dynamic random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the mixing profile of a random walk on a dynamic random permutation, focusing on the regime where the walk evolves much faster than the permutation. Two types of dynamics generated by random transpositions are considered: one allows for coagulation of permutation cycles only, the other allows for both coagulation and fragmentation. We show that for both types, after scaling time by the length of the permutation and letting this length tend to infinity, the total variation distance between the current distribution and the uniform distribution converges to a limit process that drops down in a single jump. This jump is similar to a one-sided cut-off, occurs after a random time whose law we identify, and goes from the value 1 to a value that is a strictly decreasing and deterministic function of the time of the jump, related to the size of the largest component in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. After the jump, the total variation distance follows this function down to 0.</description>

      <title>Diffusion limits in the quarter plane and non-semimartingale reflected Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time random walk in the quarter plane for which the transition intensities are constant on each of the four faces $(0,\infty)^2$, $F_1=\{0\}\times(0,\infty)$, $F_2=(0,\infty)\times\{0\}$ and $\{(0,0)\}$. We show that when rescaled diffusively it converges in law to a Brownian motion with oblique reflection direction $d^{(i)}$ on face $F_i$, $i=1,2$, defined via the Varadhan-Williams submartingale problem. A parameter denoted by $\alpha$ was introduced in \cite{vw}, measuring the extent to which $d^{(i)}$ are inclined toward the origin. In the case of the quarter plane, $\alpha$ takes values in $(-2,2)$, and it is known that the reflected Brownian motion is a semimartingale if and only if $\alpha\in(-2,1)$. Convergence results via both the Skorohod map and the invariance principle for semimartingale reflected Brownian motion are known to hold in various settings in arbitrary dimension. In the case of the quarter plane, the invariance principle was proved for $\alpha \in (-2,1)$ whereas for tools based on the Skorohod map to be applicable it is necessary (but not sufficient) that $\alpha \in [-1,1)$. Another tool that has been used to prove convergence in general dimension is the extended Skorohod map, which in the case of the quarter plane provides convergence for $\alpha=1$. This paper focuses on the range $\alpha \in (1,2)$, where the Skorohod problem and the extended Skorohod problem do not possess a unique solution, the limit process is not a semimartingale, and convergence to reflected Brownian motion has not been shown before. The result has implications on the asymptotic analysis of two Markovian queueing models: The {\it generalized processor sharing model with parallelization slowdown}, and the {\it coupled processor model}.</description>

      <title>Penalization of Galton Watson trees with marked vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Galton-Watson tree where each node is marked independently of each others with a probability depending on itsout-degree. Using a penalization method, we exhibit new martingales where the number of marks up to level n -- 1 appears. Then, we use these martingales to define new probability measures via a Girsanov transformation and describe the distribution of the random trees under these new probabilities.</description>

      <title>Markov processes with jump kernels decaying at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a general theory for non-local singular operators of the type $$
  L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}f(x)=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \int_{D,\, |y-x|&gt;\epsilon}\big(f(y)-f(x)\big) \mathcal{B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}\,dy, $$ and $$ L f(x)=L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}f(x) - \kappa(x) f(x), $$ in case $D$ is a $C^{1,1}$ open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$. The function $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ above may vanish at the boundary of $D$, and the killing potential $\kappa$ may be subcritical or critical.
  From a probabilistic point of view we study the reflected process on the closure $\overline{D}$ with infinitesimal generator $L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}$, and its part process on $D$ obtained by either killing at the boundary $\partial D$, or by killing via the killing potential $\kappa(x)$. The general theory developed in this work (i) contains subordinate killed stable processes in $C^{1,1}$ open sets as a special case, (ii) covers the case when $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ is bounded between two positive constants and is well approximated by certain H\"older continuous functions, and (iii) extends the main results known for the half-space in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The main results of the work are the boundary Harnack principle and its possible failure, and sharp two-sided Green function estimates. Our results on the boundary Harnack principle completely cover the corresponding earlier results in the case of half-space. Our Green function estimates extend the corresponding earlier estimates in the case of half-space to bounded $C^{1, 1}$ open sets.</description>

      <title>Stationary entrance chains and applications to random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Markov chain $Y$ with values in a Polish space, consider the entrance chain obtained by sampling $Y$ at the moments when it enters a fixed set $A$ from its complement $A^c$. Similarly, consider the exit chain, obtained by sampling $Y$ at the exit times from $A^c$ to $A$. We use the method of inducing from ergodic theory to study invariant measures of these two types of Markov chains in the case when the initial chain $Y$ has a known invariant measure. We give explicit formulas for invariant measures of the entrance and exit chains under certain recurrence-type assumptions on $A$ and $A^c$, which apply even for transient chains. Then we study uniqueness and ergodicity of these invariant measures assuming that $Y$ is topologically recurrent, topologically irreducible, and weak Feller.
  We give applications to random walks in $R^d$, which we regard as "stationary" Markov chains started under the Lebesgue measure. We are mostly interested in dimension one, where we study the Markov chain of overshoots above the zero level of a random walk that oscillates between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. We show that this chain is ergodic, and use this result to prove a central limit theorem for the number of level crossings for random walks with zero mean and finite variance of increments.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of strong approximation of stochastic differential equations with a non-Lipschitz drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey recent developments in the field of complexity of pathwise approximation in $p$-th mean of the solution of a stochastic differential equation at the final time based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion. First, we briefly review the case of equations with globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, for which an error rate of at least $1/2$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is always guaranteed by using the equidistant Euler-Maruyama scheme. Then we illustrate that giving up the global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients may lead to a non-polynomial decay of the error for the Euler-Maruyama scheme or even to an arbitrary slow decay of the smallest possible error that can be achieved on the basis of finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion. Finally, we turn to recent positive results for equations with a drift coefficient that is not globally Lipschitz continuous. Here we focus on scalar equations with a Lipschitz continuous diffusion coefficient and a drift coefficient that satisfies piecewise smoothness assumptions or has fractional Sobolev regularity and we present corresponding complexity results.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum of the Potential of a General Two-Dimensional Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the leading order of the maximum of the random potential associated to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas for general $\beta$ and general confinement potential, extending the recent result of Lambert-Lebl\'e-Zeitouni. In the case $\beta=2$, this corresponds to the (centered) log-characteristic polynomial of either the Ginibre random matrix ensemble for $V(x)=\frac{|x|^2}{2}$ or a more general normal matrix ensemble. The result on the leading order asymptotics for the maximum of the log-characteristic polynomial is new for random normal matrices. We rely on connections with the classical obstacle problem and the theory of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos. We make use of a new concentration result for fluctuations of $C^{1,1}$ linear statistics which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Probability to Hit Every Bin with a Linear Number of Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $2n$ balls are thrown independently and uniformly at random into $n$ bins. We consider the unlikely event $E$ that every bin receives at least one ball, showing that $\Pr[E] = \Theta(b^n)$ where $b \approx 0.836$. Note that, due to correlations, $b$ is not simply the probability that any single bin receives at least one ball. More generally, we consider the event that throwing $\alpha n$ balls into $n$ bins results in at least $d$ balls in each bin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local sensitivity of heating degree day (HDD) and cooling degree day (CDD) temperature futures and option prices with respect to perturbations in the deseasonalized temperature or in one of its derivatives up to a certain order determined by the continuous-time autoregressive process modelling the deseasonalized temperature in the HDD and CDD indexes. We also consider an empirical case where a CAR process of autoregressive order 3 is fitted to New York temperatures and we perform a study of the local sensitivity of these financial contracts and a posterior analysis of the results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>On the signature of an image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the importance of the 1D signature which can be seen as a functional defined along a path, has been pivotal in both path-wise stochastic calculus and the analysis of time series data. By considering an image as a two-parameter function that takes values in a $d$-dimensional space, we introduce an extension of the path signature to images. We address numerous challenges associated with this extension and demonstrate that the 2D signature satisfies a version of Chen's relation in addition to a shuffle-type product. Furthermore, we show that specific variations of the 2D signature can be recursively defined, thereby satisfying an integral-type equation. We analyze the properties of the proposed signature, such as continuity, invariance to stretching, translation and rotation of the underlying image. Additionally, we establish that the proposed 2D signature over an image satisfies a universal approximation property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative homogenization results for the popular log-normal coefficients. Since the coefficients are neither bounded nor uniformly elliptic, standard proofs do not apply directly. Instead, we take inspiration from the approach developed for the nonlinear setting by the first two authors and capitalize on large-scale regularity results by Bella, Fehrmann, and Otto for degenerate coefficients in order to leverage an optimal control (in terms of scaling and stochastic integrability) of oscillations and fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the expected area of the amoeba of a complex plane curve of degree $d$ is less than $\displaystyle{3\ln(d)^2/2+9\ln(d)+9}$ and once rescaled by $\ln(d)^2$, is asymptotically bounded from below by $3/4$. In order to get this lower bound, given disjoint isometric embeddings of a bidisc of size $1/\sqrt{d}$ in the complex projective plane, we lower estimate the probability that one of them is a submanifold chart of a complex plane curve. It exponentially converges to one as the number of bidiscs grow to $+\infty$.</description>

      <title>Inferences for Random Graphs Evolved by Clustering Attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of random undirected graphs by the clustering attachment (CA) both without node and edge deletion and with uniform node or edge deletion is investigated. Theoretical results are obtained for the CA without node and edge deletion when a newly appended node is connected to two existing nodes of the graph at each evolution step. Theoretical results concern to (1) the sequence of increments of the consecutive mean clustering coefficients tends to zero; (2) the sequences of node degrees and triangle counts of any fixed node which are proved to be submartingales. These results were obtained for any initial graph. The simulation study is provided for the CA with uniform node or edge deletion and without any deletion. It is shown that (1) the CA leads to light-tailed distributed node degrees and triangle counts; (2) the average clustering coefficient tends to a constant over time; (3) the mean node degree and the mean triangle count increase over time with the rate depending on the parameters of the CA. The exposition is accompanied by a real data study.</description>

      <title>Proof mining and probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theoretical framework of proof mining by establishing general logical metatheorems that allow for the extraction of the computational content of theorems with prima facie "non-computational" proofs from probability theory, thereby unlocking a major branch of mathematics as a new area of application for these methods. Concretely, we devise proof-theoretically tame logical systems that, for one, allow for the formalization of proofs involving algebras of sets together with probability contents as well as associated Lebesgue integrals on them and which, for another, are amenable to proof-theoretic metatheorems in the style of proof mining that guarantee the extractability of effective and tame bounds from larges classes of ineffective existence proofs in probability theory. Moreover, these extractable bounds are guaranteed to be highly uniform in the sense that they will be independent of all parameters relating to the underlying probability space, particularly regarding events or measures of them. As such, these results, in particular, provide the first logical explanation for the success and the observed uniformities of the previous ad hoc case studies of proof mining in these areas and further illustrate their extent. Beyond these systems, we provide extensions for the proof-theoretically tame treatment of $\sigma$-algebras and associated probability measures using an intensional approach to infinite unions. Lastly, we establish a general proof-theoretic transfer principle that allows for the lift of quantitative information on a relationship between different modes of convergence for sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.</description>

      <title>A time-stepping deep gradient flow method for option pricing in (rough) diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European options in diffusion models, that can efficiently handle high-dimensional problems resulting from Markovian approximations of rough volatility models. The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model.</description>

      <title>The coalescent structure of Galton-Watson trees in varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the genealogy of a sample of $k\geq1$ particles chosen uniformly without replacement from a population alive at large times in a critical discrete-time Galton-Watson process in a varying environment (GWVE). We will show that subject to an explicit deterministic time-change involving only the mean and variances of the varying offspring distributions, the sample genealogy always converges to the same universal genealogical structure; it has the same tree topology as Kingman's coalescent, and the coalescent times of the $k-1$ pairwise mergers look like a mixture of independent identically distributed times. Our approach uses $k$ distinguished \emph{spine} particles and a suitable change of measure under which (a) the spines form a uniform sample without replacement, as required, but additionally (b) there is $k$-size biasing and discounting according to the population size. Our work significantly extends the spine techniques developed in Harris, Johnston, and Roberts \emph{[Annals Applied Probability, 2020]} for genealogies of uniform samples of size $k$ in near-critical continuous-time Galton-Watson processes, as well as a two-spine GWVE construction in Cardona and Palau \emph{[Bernoulli, 2021]}. Our results complement recent works by Kersting \emph{[Proc. Steklov Inst. Maths., 2022]} and Boenkost, Foutel-Rodier, and Schertzer \emph{[arXiv:2207.11612]}.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Central Limit Theorem for non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mesoscopic linear statistics $\sum_i f(n^a(\sigma_i-z_0))$ of the eigenvalues $\{\sigma_i\}_i$ of large $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with complex centred i.i.d. entries are asymptotically Gaussian for any $H^{2}_0$-functions $f$ around any point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum on any mesoscopic scale $0&lt;a&lt;1/2$. This extends our previous result [arXiv:1912.04100], that was valid on the macroscopic scale, $a=0$, to cover the entire mesoscopic regime. The main novelty is a local law for the product of resolvents for the Hermitization of $X$ at spectral parameters $z_1, z_2$ with an improved error term in the entire mesoscopic regime $|z_1-z_2|\gg n^{-1/2}$. The proof is dynamical; it relies on a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and the Green function comparison idea combined with a separation of the unstable mode of the underlying stability operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of scalar Markovian diffusion processes whose transition probability densities are skewed Gaussian distributions. Their stochastic dynamics involve nonlinear and time-dependent drifts driven by White Gaussian noise sources. The drifts are obtained via generalized $h$-transforms of a novel class of local martingales. We can alternatively represent this class of processes as dynamic censoring models with partial observability and time-dependent correlations, which can be used as a skewness-inducing noise source for any diffusion process. We prove the invariance of our class of skew-Normal processes under linear transformations. We extend our results to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Anderson model with L\'evy white noise: spatial ergodicity and fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional hyperbolic Anderson models (HAM) driven by space-time pure-jump L\'evy white noise in a finite-variance setting. Motivated by recent active research on limit theorems for stochastic partial differential equations driven by Gaussian noises, we present the first study in this L\'evy setting. In particular, we first establish the spatial ergodicity of the solution and then a quantitative central limit theorem (CLT) for the spatial averages of the solution to HAM in both Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov distance, with the same rate of convergence. To achieve the first goal (i.e. spatial ergodicity), we exploit some basic properties of the solution and apply a Poincar\'e inequality in the Poisson setting, which requires delicate moment estimates on the Malliavin derivatives of the solution. Such moment estimates are obtained in a soft manner by observing a natural connection between the Malliavin derivatives of HAM and a HAM with Dirac delta velocity. To achieve the second goal (i.e. CLT), we need two key ingredients: (i) a univariate second-order Poincar\'e inequality in the Poisson setting that goes back to Last, Peccati, and Schulte (Probab. Theory Related Fields, 2016) and has been recently improved by Trauthwein (arXiv:2212.03782); (ii) aforementioned moment estimates of Malliavin derivatives up to second order. We also establish a corresponding functional central limit theorem by (a) showing the convergence in finite-dimensional distributions and (b) verifying Kolmogorov's tightness criterion. Part (a) is made possible by a linearization trick and the univariate second-order Poincar\'e inequality, while part (b) follows from a standard moment estimate with an application of Rosenthal's inequality.</description>

      <title>A cyclic random motion in $\mathbb{R}^3$ driven by geometric counting processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the random motion of a particle that moves with constant velocity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The particle can move along four directions with different speeds that are attained cyclically. It follows that the support of the stochastic process describing the particle's position at time $t$ is a tetrahedron. We assume that the sequence of sojourn times along each direction follows a geometric counting process (GCP). When the initial velocity is fixed, we obtain the explicit form of the probability law of the process $\boldsymbol{X}(t) = (X_1(t);X_2(t);X_3(t))$, $t &gt; 0$, for the particle's position. We also investigate the limiting behavior of the related probability density when the intensities of the four GCPs tend to infinity. Furthermore, we show that the process does not admit a stationary density. Finally, we introduce the first-passage-time problem for the first component of $\boldsymbol{X}(t)$ through a constant positive boundary $\beta &gt; 0$ providing the bases for future developments.</description>

      <title>Explicit formula of boundary crossing probabilities for continuous local martingales to constant boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An explicit formula for the probability that a continuous local martingale crosses a one or two-sided random constant boundary in a finite time interval is derived. We obtain that the boundary crossing probability of a continuous local martingale to a constant boundary is equal to the boundary crossing probability of a standard Wiener process to a constant boundary up to a time change of quadratic variation value. This relies on the constancy of the boundary and the Dambis, Dubins-Schwarz theorem for continuous local martingale. The main idea of the proof is the scale invariant property of the time-changed Wiener process and thus the scale invariant property of the first-passage time. As an application, we also consider an inverse first-passage time problem of quadratic variation.</description>

      <title>A PDE approach for solving the characteristic function of the generalised signature process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signature of a path, as a fundamental object in Rough path theory, serves as a generating function for non-commutative monomials on path space. It transforms the path into a grouplike element in the tensor algebra space, summarising the path faithfully up to a generalised form of re-parameterisation (a negligible equivalence class in this context). Our paper concerns stochastic processes and studies the characteristic function of the path signature of the stochastic process. In contrast to the expected signature, it determines the law on the random signatures without any regularity condition. The computation of the characteristic function of the random signature offers potential applications in stochastic analysis and machine learning, where the expected signature plays an important role. In this paper, we focus on a time-homogeneous It\^o diffusion process, and adopt a PDE approach to derive the characteristic function of its signature defined at any fixed time horizon. A key ingredient of our approach is the introduction of the generalised-signature process. This lifting enables us to establish the Feynman-Kac-type theorem for the characteristic function of the generalised-signature process by following the martingale approach. Moreover, as an application of our results, we present a novel derivation of the joint characteristic function of Brownian motion coupled with the L\'evy area, leveraging the structure theorem of anti-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Uniform in time weak propagation of chaos on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the long time behaviour of weakly interacting diffusive particle systems on the d-dimensional torus. Our main result is to show that, under certain regularity conditions, the weak error between the empirical distribution of the particle system and the theoretical law of the limiting process (governed by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation) is of the order O(1/N), uniform in time on [0, infinity), where N is the number of particles in the interacting diffusion. This comprises general interaction terms with a small enough mean-field dependence together with interactions terms driven by an H-stable potential. Our approach relies on a systematic analysis of the long-time behaviour of the derivatives of the semigroup generated by the McKean-Vlasov SDE, which may be explicitly computed through the linearised Fokker-Planck equation. Ergodic estimates for the latter hence play a key role in our analysis. We believe that this strategy is flexible enough to cover a wider broad of situations. To wit, we succeed in adapting it to the super-critical Kuramoto model, for which the corresponding McKean-Vlasov equation has several invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Testing mean and variance by e-processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of testing conditional mean and conditional variance for non-stationary data. We build e-values and p-values for four types of non-parametric composite hypotheses with specified mean and variance as well as other conditions on the shape of the data-generating distribution. These shape conditions include symmetry, unimodality, and their combination. Using the obtained e-values and p-values, we construct tests via e-processes, also known as testing by betting, as well as some tests based on combining p-values for comparison. Although we mainly focus on one-sided tests, the two-sided test for the mean is also studied. Simulation and empirical studies are conducted under a few settings, and they illustrate features of the methods based on e-processes.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>
