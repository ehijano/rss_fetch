      <title>Accelerating multiparametric quantitative MRI using self-supervised scan-specific implicit neural representation with model reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework for reconstructing accelerated multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI).
  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI applications.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Encoding Time reduction with Radial Acquisition (PETRA) to pseudo-CT mapping for precision Focused Transcranial Ultrasound Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound simulations used for treatment planning in transcranial ultrasound stimulation(TUS) currently depend on converting computed tomography(CT) images to acoustic properties. Aiming to reduce subject exposure to ionising radiation, recent literature focused on generating pseudo-CT images from different magnetic resonance(MR) imaging sequences. Here, the PETRA (pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition) sequence was used because of its stronger ability to image bones. A dataset of paired CT and PETRA scans was acquired separately for human subjects and ex-vivo skulls. Principal component analysis performed on all bone voxels uncovered the affine relationship converting PETRA images to pseudo-CTs. Acoustic simulations based on CTs and pseudo-CTs were performed in k-Plan and k-wave. For in-vivo data, the mean absolute errors in focal position, peak pressure and focal volume were $0.48\pm0.25$mm, $5.1\pm4.0\%$ and $5.8\pm4.4\%$. The similarity of acoustic fields from ex-vivo CTs/pseudo-CTs was compared with experimental data. The corresponding errors were $1.5\pm1.2$mm, $17.1\pm14.6\%$ and $32.5\pm22.5\%$ for CT and $1.6\pm1.4$mm, $18.2\pm17.1\%$ and $19.2\pm15.9\%$ for pseudo-CT. The small errors for in-vivo data and the similarity of the experimental errors for both methods validate the use of PETRA-derived pseudo-CT as an alternative to CT, ensuring precise acoustic field predictions. The conversion tool is available at https://github.com/ucl-bug/petra-to-ct.</description>

      <title>R-Index: A Robust Metric for IVIM Parameter Estimation on Clinical MRI Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model characterizes both water diffusion and perfusion in tissues, providing quantitative biomarkers valuable for tumor tissue characterization. However, parameter estimation based on this model is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, resulting in poor reproducibility, particularly at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs) in a clinic scenario. Purpose: This study analyzes the uncertainty of IVIM model fitting, quantifies parameter collinearity, and introduces a new index with enhanced robustness to enhance clinical applicability of the IVIM model. Study Type: Prospective. Population: One healthy volunteer. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T; single-shot EPI DWI. Assessment: The probability distributions of estimated IVIM parameters were evaluated across a clinically relevant range. Collinearity among parameters was assessed and a new metric, the R-index, was proposed. The R-index linearly combines individual IVIM parameters to mitigate collinearity and reduce estimation uncertainty. Simulation and a volunteer study was conducted to validate the presence of parameter collinearity and to assess the robustness of the R-index. Statistical Tests: N/A Results: In simulation studies with a typical clinical setting (SNR = 20), normalized IVIM parameters exhibited mean standard deviations ranging from 0.107 to 0.269, while the R-index showed a reduced deviation of 0.064. Repeated scans in a healthy volunteer confirmed the presence of parameter collinearity, with 32% of voxels exhibiting statistically significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05) among fitted IVIM parameters, and a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of r = -0.96. Data Conclusion: The R-index provides a robust metric for IVIM model fitting under low SNR conditions typical of clinical MRI, offering improved reproducibility and potential for broader clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Impact of Solar Particle Events on Space Radiation Shielding: OLTARIS Simulation and Quantum Optimization of Material Selection using QAOA and VQE Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space radiation poses a significant challenge for long duration human space missions, with sources including Galactic Cosmic Rays, Solar Particle Events, and trapped particles in the Van Allen belts. These high-energy radiations cause severe biological effects on astronauts and degrade spacecraft systems, making effective shielding critical. Traditionally, passive shielding materials like aluminum have been used, but their limitations, particularly in generating secondary radiation, necessitate better alternatives. In this study, the performance of shielding materials such as lithium hydride, polyethylene, lithium borohydride, beryllium borohydride, and ammonia borane are evaluated in GCR and SPE environments using OLTARIS, a NASA developed tool. The October 1989 SPE is used to study particle flux and dose distributions. Shielding effectiveness varies by environment. Beryllium borohydride performs best in SPE, while lithium hydride gives the lowest dose in GCR. In SPE, performance is linked to hydrogen content. Effect of Solar modulation on GCR dose is also studied. Higher modulation lowers GCR intensity and dose. The complex nature of high energy space radiation and material combinations creates computational challenges. To address this, the material selection problem is modeled as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization and solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Mapping OLTARIS data to the Ising model and applying these quantum classical methods helped identify shielding setups that minimize radiation dose. Results show agreement between OLTARIS and quantum optimization for both environments.</description>

      <title>A Dual Radiomic and Dosiomic Filtering Technique for Locoregional Radiation Pneumonitis Prediction in Breast Cancer Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a serious complication of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for breast cancer patients, underscoring the need for precise and explainable predictive models. This study presents an Explainable Dual-Omics Filtering (EDOF) model that integrates spatially localized dosiomic and radiomic features for voxel-level RP prediction.
  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 72 breast cancer patients treated with IMRT was analyzed, including 28 who developed RP. The EDOF model consists of two components: (1) dosiomic filtering, which extracts local dose intensity and spatial distribution features from planning dose maps, and (2) radiomic filtering, which captures texture-based features from pre-treatment CT scans. These features are jointly analyzed using the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a transparent machine learning model that enables feature-specific risk evaluation. Model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, reporting area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Feature importance was quantified by mean absolute scores, and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) were used to visualize nonlinear relationships between RP risk and dual-omic features.
  Results: The EDOF model achieved strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.95 +- 0.01; sensitivity = 0.81 +- 0.05). The most influential features included dosiomic Intensity Mean, dosiomic Intensity Mean Absolute Deviation, and radiomic SRLGLE. PDPs revealed that RP risk increases beyond 5 Gy and rises sharply between 10-30 Gy, consistent with clinical dose thresholds. SRLGLE also captured structural heterogeneity linked to RP in specific lung regions.
  Conclusion: The EDOF framework enables spatially resolved, explainable RP prediction and may support personalized radiation planning to mitigate pulmonary toxicity.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, and shear deformed geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with an un-trained model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Phase Reversed Interleaved Multi-Echo acquisition enables highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a new pulse sequence for highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI (dMRI) by inserting additional echoes without prolonging TR, when generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (gSlider) radiofrequency encoding is used for volumetric acquisition. Methods: A phase-reversed interleaved multi-echo acquisition (PRIME) was developed for rapid, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI, which includes several echoes where the first echo is for target diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisition with high-resolution and additional echoes are acquired with either lower resolution for 1) high-fidelity field map estimation, 2) phase navigation for shot-to-shot phase correction, 3) motion navigation across diffusion directions, or with high resolution to enable 4) high fidelity diffusion relaxometry acquisitions. The sequence was evaluated on in vivo data acquired from healthy volunteers on clinical and Connectome 2.0 scanners. Results: In vivo experiments demonstrated that 1) high in-plane acceleration (Rin-plane of 5-fold with 2D partial Fourier) was achieved using the high-fidelity field maps estimated from the second echo, which was made at a lower resolution/acceleration to increase its SNR while matching the effective echo spacing of the first readout, 2) high-resolution diffusion relaxometry parameters were estimated from triple-echo PRIME data using a white matter model of multi-TE spherical mean technique (MTE-SMT), and 3) high-fidelity mesoscale DWI at 490 um isotropic resolution was obtained in vivo by capitalizing on the high-performance gradients of the Connectome 2.0 scanner. Conclusion: The proposed PRIME sequence enabled highly accelerated, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI using additional echoes without prolonging scan time when gSlider encoding is utilized.</description>
