      <title>A relativistic jet from a neutron star breaking out of its natal supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the nebula's radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet source SS433.</description>

      <title>Search for Neutrinos from the Galactic 4FGL Sources with the Pion-bump Signature with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, covers a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and is designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. While IceCube has recently identified a diffuse flux of neutrinos originating from the Galactic Plane, specific sources of astrophysical neutrinos within the Milky Way remain elusive. Hadronic gamma-rays, produced through the decay of neutral pions, are expected to display a characteristic "pion bump" or "spectral break" around 200 MeV. Recent studies by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration highlight 56 sources from the 4FGL Catalog exhibiting a spectral break in the MeV energy range. Detecting astrophysical neutrinos from these sources would provide compelling evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in their vicinity. In this analysis, we search for astrophysical neutrino emission from 56 sources showing characteristics of a pion bump using 13 years of IceCube data. Our findings could enhance our understanding of potential cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Investigating Energy-Dependent Anisotropy in Cosmic Rays with IceTop Surface Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents preliminary results from the analysis of cosmic-ray anisotropy using air showers detected by the IceTop surface array between 2011 and 2022. With improved statistical precision and updated Monte Carlo simulation events compared to previous IceTop reports, we investigate anisotropy patterns across four energy ranges spanning from 300 TeV to 6.9 PeV. This work extends the measurement of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern hemisphere to higher energies than previously achieved with IceTop. Our results provide a foundation for exploring potential connections between the observed anisotropy, the energy spectrum, and the mass composition of the cosmic-ray flux.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Energy and Redshift Distributions of the Fast Radio Burst Population Based on the First CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E&gt;10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.</description>

      <title>XL-Calibur Polarimetry of Cyg X-1 Further Constrains the Origin of its Hard-state X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimetry mission XL-Calibur observed the Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) during its nearly six-day Long Duration Balloon (LDB) flight from Sweden to Canada in July 2024. The XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and measured a $\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of $-28^{\circ}\pm 17^{\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction. We also discuss the implications of our polarization measurements in the context of models describing the origin of the broadband X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission, to which XL-Calibur provides independent constraints on any proposed emission modeling.</description>

      <title>Mass Determination of Supermassive Black Holes Governing Evolution of Radio Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain, especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Transonic Shocks around Black Holes and their Future Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Echoes in Different Tempo: Long-Term Monitoring of Crab Echoes with CHIME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crab Pulsar is known to feature plasma lensing events known as echoes. These events show additional components in the pulse profile which are produced by signal that is deflected by ionized nebular material and are therefore delayed relative to the primary emission. We observed the Crab pulsar with \ac{CHIME} during its daily transits, creating an archive of baseband recordings of bright single pulses (known as giant pulses) in the 400$-800\,\unit{MHz}$ band. From these, we produced daily stacks of aligned pulses between late October 2021 and March 2024. We find that in these averages, echoes are readily visible throughout the observation period, and we identify clear groups of echoes with distinct behaviour in terms of their evolution with time and frequency. Many echoes exhibit dispersive delays consistent with being observed through excess column densities relative to the unscattered rays, but we also find two events where the dispersive delays indicate column density deficits. For the first time, we also find echoes for which the line of sight never directly intersects the intervening structures, resulting in events with non-zero minimum delays, of around ${0.5 \rm\,ms}$. The frequency and diversity of the observed echoes make the Crab an excellent target for long-term studies of astrophysical plasma lensing.</description>

      <title>A Melody in the Noise: Modeling Echoes of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulses from the Crab pulsar are often followed by ``echoes'', produced by radiation that was deflected by small filamentary structures in the Crab nebula and thus traveled via longer paths. We describe a simplified but detailed model that treats the filaments as cylinders of dense, neutral material with a thin ionized skin. In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight crosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large electron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with electron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission ratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a relatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME. We find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near quadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in previous models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between incoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence of the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce the magnifications of the echoes. We believe this likely is because the filaments are not as smooth as envisaged, so that a given echo results from many images. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the nebula is filled with small-scale filamentary structures, which may well be substructures of the larger filaments that are seen in optical images.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Black Hole-Disk Driven Jets: Steady Axisymmetric Ideal MHD Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of HESS J0632+057: New Insights into Pulsar-Disk Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of $\phi\approx0.3\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Polarization properties of thermal accretion disk emission. I. Direct radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays Assuming a Heavy Mass Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies, supported by updated hadronic interaction models, suggest that the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays may be heavier than previously assumed. This has significant implications for source identification, as the deflections of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) are larger for heavy primaries than for lighter ones at the same energy. In this work, we assume that cosmic rays above 40 EeV consist of iron nuclei only and investigate their possible sources through simulations of cosmic ray propagation, including interactions with ambient photon fields and deflections in the GMF using multiple models. We consider two types of sources as potential origins of these cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. We compare the predicted distributions of arrival directions from sources within 250 Mpc with the measured arrival directions of cosmic rays above 40 EeV. Our results indicate that stronger correlation is found for the active galactic nuclei scenario compared to starburst galaxies. However, we find that within our heavy mass composition model, the GMF leads to significant deflections, making source identification challenging with current knowledge and tools, even at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Heavy-Metal Scenario for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We present a data-driven interpretation of UHECRs, the heavy-metal scenario, which assumes pure iron nuclei above $10^{19.6}$ eV ($\approx 40$ EeV) as the heaviest observed mass composition and introduces a global shift in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale predicted by the two hadronic interaction models QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d. We investigate the consequences of the proposed mass-composition model based on the obtained shifts in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ values, which naturally lead to a heavier mass composition of UHECRs than conventionally assumed. We explore the consequences of our model on the energy evolution of relative fractions of primary species, consequently decomposed energy spectrum, hadronic-interaction studies and the arrival directions of UHECRs. We show that within this scenario, presented recently in Vicha et al 2025 ApJL 986 L34, the cosmic-ray measurements can be interpreted in a more consistent way.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of reflected thermal emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines, with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects, will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many accreting systems by the IXPE mission.</description>

      <title>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: theory and gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Origin of the ~150 kpc radio filament in galaxy ESO 137-006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitive wide-field radio surveys have started uncovering many filamentary structures associated with the jets and lobes of radio galaxies, radio relics in galaxy clusters, and tailed galaxies. Although limited theoretical investigations on the origin of the filamentary structures have associated these filaments with astrophysical shocks and interactions with intracluster magneto-ionic media, more quantitative studies are needed to ascertain their precise nature and origin. Recent MeerKAT observations found peculiar filamentary structures (threaded radio structures) joining the lobes of a nearby FRII-like galaxy, ESO 137-006. Here we investigate the origin of these "synchrotron threads" to understand if they may be confined magnetically and could arise due to shocks associated with jet activity. Through simulation- and theory-based analysis, we find that the dynamical time (~70 Myr) associated with the shock front closely matches the estimated synchrotron age (~130 Myr) of the threads, thus making the shock origin hypothesis a favorable scenario for this particular filament.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.</description>

      <title>Classifying Compact Radio Emission in Nearby Galaxies: a 10GHz Study of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae, Anomalous Microwave Emission and Star Forming Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</description>

      <title>Disentangling spinning and nonspinning binary black hole populations with spin sorting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The individual component spins of binary black holes (BBH) are difficult to resolve using gravitational-wave observations but carry key signatures of the processes shaping their formation and evolution. Recent analyses have found conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin, but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the spin-kick alignment of pulsars from the statistics of their magnetic inclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is thought that isolated neutron stars receive a natal kick velocity at birth nearly aligned with their spin axis. Direct observational confirmation of this alignment is currently limited to a single source in a supernova remnant (PSR J0538+2817), for which the three-dimensional velocity has been well constrained. Meanwhile, pulsar polarisation statistics suggest the existence of a spin-kick correlation, though both aligned and orthogonal cases remain possible. However, if the velocities of radiopulsars are predominantly aligned with their spin axes, a systematic difference in the observed transverse velocities of pulsars with small and large magnetic obliquities would be expected. In particular, due to projection effects, weakly oblique rotators should exhibit smaller, less scattered transverse velocities. Conversely, the transverse velocities of pulsars with large magnetic inclination should reflect their actual three-dimensional velocities. This study uses this idea to analyse samples of 13 weakly and 25 strongly oblique pulsars with known distances and proper motions. We find that their peculiar velocities are distributed differently, with statistical confidence levels of 0.007 and 0.016 according to the Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. We performed a detailed population synthesis of isolated pulsars, considering the evolution of their viewing geometry in isotropic and spin-aligned kick scenarios. The observed split in the transverse velocity distributions and its amplitude are consistent with the spin-aligned kick model, but not with the isotropic case. At the same time, an orthogonal kick would predict a similar effect, but with the opposite sign. This provides robust support for pulsar spin kick alignment based on statistics, independently of polarisation.</description>

      <title>Nebular spectra of kilonovae with detailed recombination rates -- I. Light r-process composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t&gt;= 1 week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic recombination (DR) rates for the light r-process elements Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the DR rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 2x10^{-12} - 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s, 10^{-13} - 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s and 2x10^{-15} - 10^{-11} cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. Using this new atomic data (DR), we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days after the merger using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 mum) and optical (e.g. Rb I 7802, 7949 {\AA}) lines weaken in the new model. Instead [Se I] 5.03 mum emerges as a signature. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detection of black hole binaries in dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>QPO signatures of disk restoration after type-I X-ray bursts from 4U~1636$-$536</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type--I thermonuclear bursts (TNBs) from neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) originate on the neutron star's surface from the unstable burning of the accreted material. On the other hand, kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the in-spiralling accretion disk. Type-I TNBs are expected to impact the inner accretion flow, and consequently the kHz QPOs, due to the intense radiation pressure. In this work, we systematically study the evolution of the upper and the lower kHz QPOs immediately before and after a Type--I TNB on 4U 1636-536 using AstroSat observations in the 3--20,keV band. The analysis of the power-density-spectra show the presence of kHz QPOs within 200,seconds before the onset of the Type--I burst. However, we have not detected any prominent signature of the same within 100--200,sec after the burst. The kHz QPOs then re-emerges after $\approx$\,200\,sec. The fractional rms variation in the 3--20\,keV band drops by $\approx$\,5--6\,\%, supporting the non-existence of kHz QPOs in the 200\,sec post-Burst Zone. The time scale of 200\,sec coincides with the viscous time scale, highlighting a scenario where the inner disk is temporarily disrupted by the intense radiation from the Type--I TNB. The kHz QPO then re-establishes as the inner disk is restored.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization Detection of the Pulsar Wind Nebula in G21.5-0.9 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the X-ray polarization observation of G21.5-0.9, a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in October 2023, with a total livetime of approximately 837 ks. Using different analysis methods, such as a space-integrated study of the entire region of the PWN and a space-resolved polarization map, we detect significant polarization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) at the center of the SNR, with an average polarization degree of ~10% oriented at ~33{\deg} (north through east). No significant energy-dependent variation in polarization is observed across the IXPE band (2-8 keV). The polarization map, corrected for the effect of polarization leakage, reveals a consistent pattern in both degree and angle, with little change across the nebula. Our findings indicate the presence of a highly polarized central torus, suggesting low levels of turbulence at particle acceleration sites. Unlike Vela, but similar to the Crab Nebula, we observe substantial differences between radio and X-ray polarization maps. This suggests a clear separation in energy of the emitting particle populations and hints at an important, yet poorly understood, role of instabilities in the turbulence dynamics of PWNe.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Different Types of Low-Angular-Momentum Accretion Flow Solutions in General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depending on the astrophysical source and its environment, the accretion flows can exhibit a variety of behaviors and characteristics in accordance with the type of solutions. We study low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto black holes using two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) simulations to find imprints of different types of accretion solutions. Such flows, relevant to X-ray binaries and wind-fed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, often lack sufficient angular momentum to form standard accretion disks. We initialize simulations with semi-analytical transonic solutions defined by specific energy (${\cal E}_0$) and angular momentum ($\lambda_0$), allowing a systematic classification of flow types with: (i) an outer sonic point, (ii) an inner sonic point, and (iii) both, exhibiting shock transitions. Only solutions with two sonic points produce hot, thermally driven bipolar jets/outflows with Lorentz factors up to $\gamma\sim2$, despite the absence of magnetic fields. Using a general relativistic radiation transfer calculation, we compute broadband spectra and images at X-ray ($1 \, \rm keV$) from bremsstrahlung emission. Radiative properties depend strongly on the type of accretion solution. Solutions with inner sonic points produce the brightest and most extended X-ray emission, while outer-point solutions produce compact, fainter signals. These multidimensional models are thus essential for predicting radiative signatures and will enable the development of semi-analytical tools for interpreting X-ray binaries and possibly Sgr~A$^*$ in weak magnetic field regimes.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of time delay between optical/near-infrared and X-ray emissions in black hole X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive study of daily delays using multi-wavelength data from a sample of well-studied black hole X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the sources GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, and XTE J1550-564. The Interpolated-Correlation Function method was employed to investigate the temporal relationship between the X-ray (Compton component) and optical-infrared (OIR) emissions. Our results show that during the rising hard state, the Compton emission consistently lags behind OIR emission for several days. In contrast, during the decaying hard state, the OIR emission lags behind the Compton emission by approximately 6 to 35 days. This measurement can potentially be used in models of accretion physics and disk instability. We explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these time delays, highlighting the critical role of viscous heating in the accretion disk in generating OIR luminosity for these sources. The observed time delays during both the rising and decaying hard states are well explained by the disk instability model.</description>

      <title>The production of orbitally modulated UHE photons in LS 5039</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray binaries present emission that is variable and can reach UHE. The processes behind the acceleration of the particles that produce this very energetic radiation are yet to be understood. We probe the properties of the particle accelerator and the UHE photon emitter in the gamma-ray binary LS 5039. From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected by HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain the emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses, particle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an acceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target densities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability favor IC scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive companion star by highly relativistic e-. The acceleration of the highest energy e- implies a constraint on synchrotron cooling in the accelerator, which can set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Moreover, the detected variability requires very strong particle confinement in both the acceleration and emitter, which sets a lower limit on their magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the synchrotron cooling constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be higher in the emitter if it is separated from the accelerator, but this requires a very hard particle injection spectrum. An accelerator based on an ultrarelativistic outflow can alleviate these requirements. A scenario for LS 5039 as that proposed by Derishev et al., in which an ultrarelativistic magnetized outflow accelerates leptons injected within the outflow by gammagamma absorption, provides a viable mechanism to accelerate very energetic e-. This mechanism relaxes the acceleration and confinement requirements by reducing the impact of synchrotron cooling, and can generate the required e- spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may contribute a significant amount of dust in the early universe. Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm dust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the study of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN 2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature, velocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their implications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity profiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to characterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with preexisting circumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared spectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments: Gemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t&lt;70 d) spectra indicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t&lt;20 d, intermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction are superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width and narrow lines in the spectra until t&lt;70 d, which suggest continued CSM interaction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra contain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307 d after the explosion. We model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500 km/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800-2000 km/s) during similar phases (t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A. A flattened continuum at wavelengths greater than 1.5 $\mu$m accompanies the CO emission, suggesting that the warm dust is likely formed in the ejecta. The warm dust masses are estimated to be on the order of ~10$^{-5} M_{\odot}$.}</description>

      <title>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave approximants are essential for gravitational-wave astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR) simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency. To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a data-informed glitch model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g. BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04382</link>

Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

      <title>Exploring ultra-high energy neutrino experiments through the lens of the transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth's surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in the literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows one to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.</description>
