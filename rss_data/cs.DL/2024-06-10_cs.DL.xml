      <title>Streamlining and standardizing software citations with The Software Citation Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software is crucial for the advancement of astronomy especially in the context of rapidly growing datasets that increasingly require algorithm and pipeline development to process the data and produce results. However, software has not always been consistently cited, despite its importance to strengthen support for software development. To encourage, streamline, and standardize the process of citing software in academic work such as publications we introduce 'The Software Citation Station': a publicly available website and tool to quickly find or add software citations</description>

      <title>InaGVAD : a Challenging French TV and Radio Corpus Annotated for Speech Activity Detection and Speaker Gender Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InaGVAD is an audio corpus collected from 10 French radio and 18 TV channels categorized into 4 groups: generalist radio, music radio, news TV, and generalist TV. It contains 277 1-minute-long annotated recordings aimed at representing the acoustic diversity of French audiovisual programs and was primarily designed to build systems able to monitor men's and women's speaking time in media. inaGVAD is provided with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speaker Gender Segmentation (SGS) annotations extended with overlap, speaker traits (gender, age, voice quality), and 10 non-speech event categories. Annotation distributions are detailed for each channel category. This dataset is partitioned into a 1h development and a 3h37 test subset, allowing fair and reproducible system evaluation. A benchmark of 6 freely available VAD software is presented, showing diverse abilities based on channel and non-speech event categories. Two existing SGS systems are evaluated on the corpus and compared against a baseline X-vector transfer learning strategy, trained on the development subset. Results demonstrate that our proposal, trained on a single - but diverse - hour of data, achieved competitive SGS results. The entire inaGVAD package; including corpus, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baseline training code; is made freely accessible, fostering future advancement in the domain.</description>

      <title>Chronicling Germany: An Annotated Historical Newspaper Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correct detection of article layout in historical newspaper pages remains challenging but is important for Natural Language Processing ( NLP) and machine learning applications in the field of digital history. Digital newspaper portals typically provide Optical Character Recognition ( OCR) text, albeit of varying quality. Unfortunately, layout information is often missing, limiting this rich source's scope. Our dataset is designed to address this issue for historic German-language newspapers. The Chronicling Germany dataset contains 581 annotated historical newspaper pages from the time period between 1852 and 1924. Historic domain experts have spent more than 1,500 hours annotating the dataset. The paper presents a processing pipeline and establishes baseline results on in- and out-of-domain test data using this pipeline. Both our dataset and the corresponding baseline code are freely available online. This work creates a starting point for future research in the field of digital history and historic German language newspaper processing. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to study a low-resource task in computer vision.</description>
