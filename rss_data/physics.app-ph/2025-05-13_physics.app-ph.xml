      <title>High-Q Millimeter-Wave Acoustic Resonators in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Using Higher-Order Antisymmetric Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents miniature millimeter wave (mmWave, above 30 GHz) acoustic resonators based on a single-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. More specifically, we present high performance third-order antisymmetric (A3) mode laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBAR). Compared to prior demonstrations, the proposed platform features a compact footprint due to a smaller lateral wavelength and aperture. We showcase an A3 mode device operating at 39.8 GHz with a high extracted electromechanical coupling (k2) of 4%, a high 3-dB series resonance quality factor (Q_s) of 97, and a high 3-dB anti-resonance quality factor (Q_p) of 342, leading to a figure of merit (FoM=k^2*Q_p) of 13.7 with a footprint of 32x44 micron^2. To demonstrate frequency scalability, the piezoelectric film thickness is varied while keeping the device layout. As a result, we present a multitude of high-performance devices covering a wide frequency range of 30-50 GHz, validating the proposed XBAR design at mmWave.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Broadband Antennas for Terahertz Devices Based on 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology, a cornerstone of next-generation high-speed communication and sensing, has long been hindered by impedance mismatch challenges that limit device performance and applicability. These challenges become particularly pronounced when ultrasensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials are employed as the device substrate in the THz range, further complicating their integration into real-world applications. Furthermore, conventional antenna designs often fail to provide adequate matching across the extensive THz spectrum. In this work, we tackle these challenges using a procedural generation algorithm to design THz broadband antennas that satisfy specific performance criteria. Namely, the developed inverse design methodology enables customization for the target impedance value, bandwidth, and contact topology requirements. The proposed antenna achieves an improvement of up to 40\% in power transfer efficiency compared to traditional bow-tie antennas under realistic operating conditions. High-fidelity electromagnetic simulations validate these results, confirming the design's practicality for THz applications. This work addresses critical limitations of existing antenna designs and advances the feasibility of high-frequency applications in both communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity Modulation of Auto-oscillations in Three-terminal Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) hold encouraging promise for nanoscale microwave generators, modulators, and new types of intelligent computing. The nonlinearity, describing the current-induced tunability of oscillating frequency, is a distinctive feature of STNOs, which plays important roles in efficient manipulation of microwave frequencies, rapid spec-trum analysis, and the design of neuromorphic devices. However, experimental research on its efficient modulation remains limited. Here, we comprehensively studied the impact of several factors on nonlinearity in nanoscale three-terminal MTJ-STNOs, including the external magnetic field, the thickness of CoFeB free layer, and the combination of spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT). Among these factors, nonlinearity can be significantly tuned by the direction of magnetic field as well as the thickness of CoFeB free layer. Notably, it reaches zero in 1.1 nm CoFeB, where the oscillation frequency is not affected by the drive current. Such property provides a more intrinsic and robust approach to achieve zero nonlinearity in STNOs, which is advantageous for high-quality microwave generators. More importantly, we found that nonlinearity can also be electrically modulated by both STT and SOT currents, and develop a refined model that accounts for the additional contribution of the SOT current to explain the mechanism. This electrical approach is more convenient, energy-efficient, and well-suited for miniaturization. Our findings offer a comprehensive understanding and open up a new dimension for the current tunability of nonlinearity in MTJ-STNOs, benefiting further optimization in nanoscale STNO-based microwave generators and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of k-Gaps in Dynamically Modulated Phononic Time Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet time crystals, characterized by momentum gaps (k-gaps), have sparked intense interest across various branches of physics due to their intriguing dynamics and promising applications. Despite growing theoretical efforts, the realization and observation of phononic time crystals, especially for airborne sound, remain significant experimental challenges. In this work, we demonstrate a phononic time crystal by integrating discrete resonant meta-atoms into a one-dimensional acoustic waveguide, effectively creating a homogeneous, time-varying metamaterial. By dynamically modulating the effective compressibility, we experimentally observe exponential acoustic wave amplification, offering clear evidence of k-gap formation. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of our platform by inducing momentum band folding and double k-gap phenomena via quasi-periodic temporal modulation. This flexible and reconfigurable approach not only enables the design of tailor-made resonant responses but also opens new avenues for realizing higher-dimensional phononic time crystals and exploring nontrivial topological dynamics in time-modulated media.</description>

      <title>Alcohol induced surface charging of colloidal quantum dots for controllable electrophoretic deposition processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report an alcohol-induced surface charging route of colloidal QDs to achieve controllable electrophoretic deposition processing. By adding a fixed amounts of alcohols into a preformed quantum dots solution in non-polar solvents, the colloidal quantum dots can be positively charged, and then deposited on negative electrode under applied electric field. The surface charging of PbSe quantum dots was investigated by zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and discrete Fourier transform calculations. It was found that the zeta potential of oleate acid capped PbSe QDs increases from +1.6 mV to +13.4 mV with the amount of alcohol solvent increasing. The alcohol-induced zeta potential increasing can be explained to the electron cloud shift of active hydrogen mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxy acid and alcohol. Considering the influence of surface charging of quantum dots on their dispersibility, we describe the microscopic mechanism of alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing. Furthermore, we developed a size-selective separation protocol by controlling alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing.</description>

      <title>On the internal architecture of lightweight negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) metastructures: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of lightweight materials with enhanced mechanical properties has been a long-standing challenge in science and engineering. Lightweight auxetic metastructures (AMSs) provide attractive solutions to this problem. AMSs' negative Poisson's ratio is a unique characteristic which results in very interesting practical properties such as high energy absorption and improved toughness. Different properties of metastrcutures, including anisotropy, are dependent, in addition to their original material, on the unit cell shape and geometrical features which have very high variations. Over the past few years, researchers have developed AMSs with various unit cells, either introducing new internal architecture or enhancing and optimizing the existing ones. Despite the progress made in this field, there is no comprehensive review of the AMS unit cells. This review describes the cellular AMSs associated with a classified set of metastructures, comprising more than 100 distinct auxetic repetitive unit cells. Besides, achievable range of negative Poisson's ratios are provided for different categories of AMSs. Finally, the future perspective of the research field and potential developments and applications in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Large-area topological wireless power transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies have attracted considerable interest due to their high transmission efficiency and robustness in coupled array configurations. However, conventional periodic and quasi-periodic topological chains exhibit limited adaptability in complex application scenarios, such as large-area simultaneous multi-load charging. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a large-area topological defect state by constructing a gapless chain of uniformly coupled resonators at the interface of two topologically distinct Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) configurations. This topological defect state exhibits strong localization at multiple target sites, enabling efficient and concurrent wireless power delivery to spatially distributed loads. Furthermore, the unique wavefunction distribution enhances robustness against positional variations, ensuring stable energy transfer despite fluctuations in device placement. The proposed large-area topological framework offers fundamental insights into harnessing diverse topological states for advanced WPT applications, particularly in scenarios demanding spatial flexibility and multi-target energy delivery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field magnetic resonance wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has garnered significant attention due to its broad application prospects in medical implants, electric vehicles, and robotics. Addressing the challenges faced by traditional WPT systems in frequency optimization and sensitivity to environmental disturbances, this study innovatively applies the gradient descent optimization algorithm to enhance a system with topological characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning-optimized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like chain exhibits exceptional performance in transfer efficiency and system robustness.

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</description>

      <title>17 GHz Lossless InP-Membrane Active Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed active metasurfaces enable spatiotemporal control of incident light within an ultra-thin layer, offering new possibilities for optical communication, computing, and sensing. However, a fundamental tradeoff between electrical conductivity and optical absorption of the material has hindered the realization of active metasurfaces that simultaneously achieve broad modulation bandwidth and low optical loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-speed active metasurface operating in the 1.5-{\mu}m wavelength range that realizes a record-high modulation bandwidth of 17.5 GHz, while maintaining a high quality (Q) factor of 102 and an ultra-low optical loss of 0.56 dB. The key enabling technology is the indium-phosphide (InP) membrane platform; an n-type InP offers both high electron mobility and low free-carrier optical absorption, making it an ideal material for active metasurface devices. The high-Q Friedrich-Wintgen quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum mode inside the InP-membrane high-contrast grating (HCG) is utilized to trap the normally incident light within an organic electro-optic (OEO) material, enabling efficient modulation. InP HCG also serves as an ultralow-resistance interdigitated electrodes for applying high-speed electrical signals to the OEO material, thereby offering 50-fold improvement in modulation bandwidth compared to conventional silicon-based counterparts. Our work paves the way towards high-speed, low-loss active metasurfaces for spatiotemporal control of light beyond the gigahertz regime.</description>

      <title>A Rapid Reconstruction Method of Gamma Radiation Field based on Normalized Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a fault occurs in nuclear facilities, accurately reconstructing gamma radiation fields through measurements from the mobile radiation detection (MRD) system becomes crucial to enable access to internal facility areas for essential safety assessments and repairs. Reconstruction of these fields is difficult because of the uncertainty in the positions and intensities of the gamma sources, the complexity of the gamma distribution, and the physics and radiation hardness constraints on the MRD systems. In this work, a novel reconstruction framework of the gamma radiation is proposed. This system entails a NPOD-based reconstruction algorithm with MRD data, and a variation-based adaptive measurements selection mechanism. Our approach has been thoroughly assessed using extensive simulations, and the results clearly prove its success and efficiency in reconstruction radiation fields accurately and quickly. Furthermore, the designed selection algorithm is also promising for extensive application to other optimization tasks of location selection.</description>

      <title>Broadband Two-Dimensional Far-Field Beam Profiling of Commercial CW Terahertz Photomixers from 0.2 to 1.5 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic far-field characterization of four commercial PIN diode terahertz photomixers over the 0.2-1.5 THz frequency range using a two-dimensional (2D) raster scanning method. The emission pattern of each transmitter, equipped with an integrated hyper-hemispherical silicon lens, was characterized using a broadband Schottky diode receiver over a 35 mm x 35 mm grid. The results reveal consistent frequency-dependent beam divergence and the emergence of distinct Airy diffraction patterns at intermediate frequencies, attributed to lens-induced aperture effects. This comprehensive mapping underscores the importance of full 2D beam profiling for understanding THz propagation and offers insights into lens design and photomixer packaging for optimized system performance.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact 4H-silicon carbide optomechanical resonator with $f_m\cdot Q_m$ exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has great potential for optomechanical applications due to its outstanding optical and mechanical properties. However, challenges associated with SiC nanofabrication have constrained its adoption in optomechanical devices, as embodied by the considerable optical loss or lack of integrated optical access in existing mechanical resonators. In this work, we overcome such challenges and demonstrate a low-loss, ultracompact optomechanical resonator in an integrated 4H-SiC-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI) photonic platform for the first time. Based on a suspended $4.3$-$\mu$m-radius microdisk, the SiC optomechanical resonator features low optical loss ($&lt;1$ dB/cm), a high mechanical frequency $f_m$ of $0.95 \times 10^9$ Hz, a mechanical quality factor $Q_m$ of $1.92\times10^4$, and a footprint of $&lt;1\times 10^{-5}$ mm$^2$. The corresponding $f_m\cdot Q_m$ product is estimated to be $1.82 \times 10^{13}$ Hz, which is among the highest reported values of optomechanical cavities tested in an ambient environment at room temperature. In addition, the strong optomechanical coupling in the SiC microdisk enables coherent regenerative optomechanical oscillations at a threshold optical dropped power of 14 $\mu$W, which also supports efficient harmonic generation at increased power levels. With such competitive performance, we envision a range of chip-scale optomechanical applications to be enabled by the low-loss 4H-SiCOI platform.</description>

      <title>OAM spatial demultiplexing by diffraction-based noiseless mode conversion with axicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying light has been well-defined since the 1990s. Leveraging its physical phenomena has become a significant focus in various areas of research. For instance, OAM is applied in hybrid free-space optical communication channels, like wavelength division multiplexing. Due to its orthogonality, OAM can be multiplexed and demultiplexed, enabling the use of multiple orthogonal OAM beams to achieve high-capacity optical communication systems. In this appliance, there will be instability of light because its phase distribution is quite complicated. This study focuses on spatial demultiplexing using Computer Generated Holography (CGH) based OAM diffraction. Earlier research on OAM diffraction primarily involved fork gratings. Spatial demultiplexing has phase distribution instability and noise problems in free space optics. Axicons have been studied extensively in the context of perfect vortex generation. Drawing inspiration from these two areas of physics, we propose a noiseless topological charge conversion through axicon properties in spatial demultiplexing using CGH. Furthermore, we estimate the axicon optical approximate solution that is appropriate for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part I: Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The first article establishes the formal foundations of the method. Using the symmetric form of the map as a flexible test case, we benchmark the perturbative construction against established techniques, including the Lie algebra method for twist coefficients. To resolve the inherent ambiguity in the perturbation series, we introduce an averaging procedure that naturally leads to a resonant theory -- capable of treating rational rotation numbers and small-denominator divergences. This enables an accurate and structured description of low-order resonances, including singular and non-singular features in the quadratic and cubic H\'enon maps. The approach is systematic, requiring only linear algebra and integrals of elementary functions, yet it yields results in striking agreement with both theory and numerical experiment. We conclude by outlining extensions to more general maps and discussing implications for stability estimates in practical systems such as particle accelerators.</description>

Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The second article applies the method to global dynamics, with a focus on large-amplitude motion and chaotic systems. We demonstrate that the approximate invariants, once averaged, accurately capture the structure of resonances and the boundaries of stability regions. We also explore the recovery of exact invariants in integrable cases, showing that the method reproduces the correct behavior when such structure is present. A single unified function, derived from the map coefficients, yields phase portraits, rotation numbers, and tune footprints that closely match numerical tracking across wide parameter ranges. Comparisons with the Square Matrix method reveal that while both approaches satisfy local constraints, our technique provides greater accuracy and robustness in resonant and strongly nonlinear regimes. These results highlight the method's practical power and broad relevance, offering a compact, analytic framework for organizing nonlinear dynamics in symplectic maps with direct applications to beam physics and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbative method for constructing approximate invariants of motion directly from the equations of discrete-time symplectic systems. This framework offers a natural nonlinear extension of the classic Courant-Snyder (CS) theory -- a foundational cornerstone in accelerator physics now spanning seven decades and historically focused on linear phenomena. The original CS formalism emerged under conditions where nonlinearities were weak, design goals favored linear motion, and analytical tools -- such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory -- had not yet been fully developed. While various normal form methods have been proposed to treat near-integrable dynamics, the approach introduced here stands out for its conceptual transparency, minimal computational overhead, and direct applicability to realistic systems. We demonstrate its power and versatility by applying it to several operational accelerator configurations at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FermiLab), illustrating how the method enables fast, interpretable diagnostics of nonlinear behavior across a broad range of machine conditions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

      <title>Superdirective Mixed-Multipole-based Unidirectional Spherical Dielectric Lens Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of superdirective dielectric lens antennas are reported emphasizing unidirectional properties. The developed antennas are based on the higher-order transverse electric and magnetic modes present in a multilayered sphere realized with high permittivity dielectrics. The superdirective properties of the lenses are empowered by exciting them with a basic unidirectional mixed-multipole antenna. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization was employed to identify configurations that yielded both large directivity and front-to-back ratio outcomes. The analytical evaluations of several example systems of spheres having different outer radii and numbers of layers are described. Their radiated field patterns are presented along with comparisons with known directivity bounds to confirm their superdirective performance characteristics. Subsequent numerical assessments with commercial full-wave finite element simulations of more realistic versions of several selected examples illustrate their potential for experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Pyrite Bismuth Telluride Heterojunction for Hybrid Electromagnetic to Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and connected devices has led to pervasive electromagnetic (EM) energy dissipation into the environment, an underutilized resource for energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate a pyrite (FeS$_2$)-bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) heterojunction that enables hybrid electromagnetic-to-thermoelectric energy conversion. Fabricated via a simple cold-press compaction of powders, the heterojunction forms a Schottky interface at FeS$_2$, facilitating efficient RF absorption and localized heating. This heat is harvested by Bi$_2$Te$_3$ through thermoelectric conversion. Under 35~MHz RF irradiation at 1~W input power, the device achieved a local temperature rise of 46~$^\circ$C and a thermal gradient of 5.5~K across the Bi$_2$Te$_3$, resulting in a peak power density of approximately 13~mW/cm$^2$. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the heat transport behavior and interfacial thermoelectric performance. This work introduces a new class of heterostructures for RF-responsive energy harvesting, offering a scalable route toward self-powered IoT and wireless sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering symmetry of diffusive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress in manipulating heat diffusion has been achieved with the advent of non-Hermitian physics and topology. However, previous studies on diffusive systems have primarily concentrated on isolated cases, where fields decay exponentially over time. In practical scenarios, systems inevitably interact with external environments, making it essential to study their responses to external heat signals. This, in turn, relies on analyzing the scattering behavior of these signals. In our work, we experimentally realize thermal scattering in a diffusive anti-parity-time (APT) system. We define key parameters of the temperature field-amplitude, phase, and chirality-and reveal that the scattering symmetry of the APT diffusive system only arises when temperature signals with different chiralities interact. Such mechanism is induced by the unique dispersion properties in diffusive systems, where positive and negative frequencies are inequivalent, corresponding to different chiralities. This also explains the difficulty of observing APT scattering symmetry in wave systems. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of scattering channels in the symmetry and phase transitions of non-Hermitian systems and propose novel approaches for analyzing and controlling strongly dissipative phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping techniques allow waves to be focused on a diffraction-limited target deep inside disordered media. To identify the target position, a guidestar is required that typically emits a frequency-shifted signal. Here we present a noninvasive matrix approach operating at a single frequency only, based on the variation of the field scattered by a nonlinear target illuminated at two different incident powers. The local perturbation induced by the nonlinearity serves as a guide for identifying optimal incident wavefronts. We demonstrate maximal focusing on electronic devices embedded in chaotic microwave cavities and extend our approach to temporal signals. Finally, we exploit the programmability offered by reconfigurable smart surfaces to enhance the intensity delivered to a nonlinear target. Our results pave the way for deep imaging protocols that use any type of nonlinearity as feedback, requiring only the measurement of a monochromatic scattering matrix.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory. Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moir\'e plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both crystallized and quasi-crystallized optical skyrmion lattices, revealing an unprecedented degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model. This topological change of moir\'eplasmonic skyrmion clusters can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between composite nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Observation of Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff`s law of thermal radiation stating the equivalence of emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength, angle, and polarization, has completely constrained emission and absorption processes. Achieving strong nonreciprocal emission points to fundamental advances for applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and sensing, but strong nonreciprocal thermal emission has not been experimentally realized. Here, we observe strong nonreciprocal thermal emission using a custom-designed angle-resolved magnetic thermal emission spectroscopy and an epitaxially-transferred gradient-doped metamaterial. We show that under magnetic field, the metamaterial strongly breaks the Kirchhoff`s law, with a difference between emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength and angle reaching as high as 0.43. Significant nonreciprocal emission persists over broad spectral and angular ranges. The demonstration of strong nonreciprocal thermal emission and the approach can be useful for systematic exploration of nonreciprocal thermal photonics for thermal management, infrared camouflage, and energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), featuring sinusoidally profiled diffractive elements, manipulate light through patterned nanostructures and incident angle modulation. Compared to altering structural parameters, tuning elevation and azimuth angles offers greater design flexibility for light field control. However, angle-resolved responses of OFSs are often complex due to diverse mode excitations and couplings, complicating the alignment between simulations and practical fabrication. Here, we present a reality-infused deep learning framework, empowered by angle-resolved measurements, to enable real-time and accurate predictions of angular dispersion in quasi-OFSs. This approach captures critical features, including nanofabrication and measurement imperfections, which conventional simulation-based methods typically overlook. Our framework significantly accelerates the design process while achieving predictive performance highly consistent with experimental observations across broad angular and spectral ranges. Our study supports valuable insights into the development of OFS-based devices, and represents a paradigm shift from simulation-driven to reality-infused methods, paving the way for advancements in optical design applications.</description>
