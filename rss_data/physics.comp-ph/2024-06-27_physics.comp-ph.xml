      <title>PIC2O-Sim: A Physics-Inspired Causality-Aware Dynamic Convolutional Neural Operator for Ultra-Fast Photonic Device FDTD Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which is important in photonic hardware design flow, is widely adopted to solve time-domain Maxwell equations. However, FDTD is known for its prohibitive runtime cost, taking minutes to hours to simulate a single device. Recently, AI has been applied to realize orders-of-magnitude speedup in partial differential equation (PDE) solving. However, AI-based FDTD solvers for photonic devices have not been clearly formulated. Directly applying off-the-shelf models to predict the optical field dynamics shows unsatisfying fidelity and efficiency since the model primitives are agnostic to the unique physical properties of Maxwell equations and lack algorithmic customization. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the synergy between neural operator designs and the physical property of Maxwell equations and introduce a physics-inspired AI-based FDTD prediction framework PIC2O-Sim which features a causality-aware dynamic convolutional neural operator as its backbone model that honors the space-time causality constraints via careful receptive field configuration and explicitly captures the permittivity-dependent light propagation behavior via an efficient dynamic convolution operator. Meanwhile, we explore the trade-offs among prediction scalability, fidelity, and efficiency via a multi-stage partitioned time-bundling technique in autoregressive prediction. Multiple key techniques have been introduced to mitigate iterative error accumulation while maintaining efficiency advantages during autoregressive field prediction. Extensive evaluations on three challenging photonic device simulation tasks have shown the superiority of our PIC2O-Sim method, showing 51.2% lower roll-out prediction error, 23.5 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art neural operators, providing 300-600x higher simulation speed than an open-source FDTD numerical solver.</description>

      <title>QMol-grid: A MATLAB package for quantum-mechanical simulations in atomic and molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QMol-grid package provides a suite of routines for performing quantum-mechanical simulations in atomic and molecular systems in one spatial dimension. It supports ground- and excited-state calculations for the Schrodinger equation, density-functional theory, and Hartree-Fock levels of theory as well as propagators for field-free and field-driven time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) and real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), using symplectic-split schemes. The package is written using MATLAB's object-oriented features and handle classes. It is designed to facilitate access to the wave function(s) (TDSE) and the Kohn-Sham orbitals (TDDFT) within MATLAB's environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Fluid Simulation of 2D Turbulence with GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network algorithms can efficiently simulate complex quantum many-body systems by utilizing knowledge of their structure and entanglement. These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Refining Potential Energy Surface through Dynamical Properties via Differentiable Molecular Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying $\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solvation of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions from vibrational spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>ViPErLEED package II: Spot tracking, extraction and processing of I(V) curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the ViPErLEED project (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED, low-energy electron diffraction), computer programs have been developed for facile and user-friendly data extraction from movies of LEED images. The programs make use of some concepts from astronomical image processing and analysis. As a first step, flat-field and dark-frame corrections reduce the effects of inhomogeneities of the camera and screen. In a second step, for identifying all diffraction maxima ("spots"), it is sufficient to manually mark and label a single spot or very few spots. Then the program can automatically identify all other spots and determine the distortions of the image. This forms the basis for automatic spot tracking (following the "beams" as they move across the LEED screen) and intensity measurement. Even for complex structures with hundreds to a few thousand diffraction beams, this step takes less than a minute. The package also includes a program for further processing of these I(V) curves (averaging of equivalent beams, manual and/or automatic selection, smoothing) as well as several utilities. The software is implemented as a set of plugins for the public-domain image processing program ImageJ and provided as an open-source package.</description>

      <title>Particle-Particle Random Phase Approximation for Predicting Correlated Excited States of Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) within the hole-hole channel was recently proposed as an efficient tool for computing excitation energies of point defects in solids [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2024, 15, 2757-2764]. In this work, we investigate the application of ppRPA within the particle-particle channel for predicting correlated excited states of point defects, including the carbon-vacancy (VC) in diamond, the oxygen-vacancy (VO) in magnesium oxide (MgO), and the carbon dimer defect (C$_{\text{B}}$C$_{\text{N}}$) in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Starting from a density functional theory calculation of the ($N-2$)-electron ground state, vertical excitation energies of the $N$-electron system are obtained as the differences between the two-electron addition energies. We show that active-space ppRPA with the B3LYP functional yields accurate excitation energies, with errors mostly smaller than 0.1 eV for tested systems compared to available experimental values. We further develop a natural transition orbital scheme within ppRPA, which provides insights into the multireference character of defect states. This study, together with our previous work, establishes ppRPA as a low-cost and accurate method for investigating excited-state properties of point defect systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HYPERTILING is a high-performance Python library for the generation and visualization of regular hyperbolic lattices embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model. Using highly optimized, efficient algorithms, hyperbolic tilings with millions of vertices can be created in a matter of minutes on a single workstation computer. Facilities including computation of adjacent vertices, dynamic lattice manipulation, refinements, as well as powerful plotting and animation capabilities are provided to support advanced uses of hyperbolic graphs. In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive exploration of the package, encompassing its mathematical foundations, usage examples, applications, and a detailed description of its implementation.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we propose using Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we focus on the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct accurate ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key model parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of accurate ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of 100 time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over 400 additional time units. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture the important features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Core, Valence and Double-Core-Polarization Contributions to Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs using Different Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines the accuracy of different many-body methods for the calculations of parity violating electric dipole ($E1_{\text{PV}}$) amplitudes in atomic systems. In the last decade many different groups claim to achieve its accuracy below 0.5\%, for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~ ^2S_{1/2} $ transition in $^{133}$Cs atom. One of the major issues in these calculations is the opposite signs among the core correlation contribution from different works. To estimate $E1_{\text{PV}}$ of the above transition, various groups have used different many-body methods both in the linear response and sum-over-states approaches. By examining how these methods capture various electron correlation effects, we identify the underlying cause of sign discrepancies in the previously reported results. We also demonstrate how the double-core polarisation effects and scaled wave functions influence estimation of the $E1_{\text{PV}}$ amplitudes. The comprehensive discussions provided in this work will not only aid in our understanding on the potentials of the employed many-body methods but it will also serves as a road map for improving the $E1_{\text{PV}}$ calculation in the atomic systems further.</description>
