      <title>Describing Deferred Acceptance and Strategyproofness to Participants: Experimental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an incentivized lab experiment to test participants' ability to understand the DA matching mechanism and the strategyproofness property, conveyed in different ways. We find that while many participants can (using a novel GUI) learn DA's mechanics and calculate its outcomes, such understanding does not imply understanding of strategyproofness (as measured by specially designed tests). However, a novel menu description of strategyproofness conveys this property significantly better than other treatments. While behavioral effects are small on average, participants with levels of strategyproofness understanding above a certain threshold play the classical dominant strategy at very high rates.</description>

      <title>Anchoring UK Retail Digital Money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the UK, the Bank of England and HM Treasury are exploring a potential UK retail CBDC, the digital pound, with one of their motivations being the potential role of the digital pound as an anchor for monetary and financial stability. In this paper, we explore three elements for anchoring money (singleness of money, official currency as the unit of account, and safety and soundness of financial institutions and payment systems) that maintain public trust and confidence in private UK retail digital money and the financial system. We also identify core capabilities (comprising on-demand interoperability across issuers and forms of private money, settlement finality in wholesale central bank money, and access to physical cash) and appropriate measures (comprising customer funds protection, robust regulation, effective supervision, safe innovation in money and payments, and the central bank as the lender of last resort) that together provide the foundations for the three elements for anchoring money. Our preliminary analysis concludes that anchoring private UK retail digital money is supported by these elements, capabilities and measures. Further work could include public-private collaboration to explore anchoring all forms of UK retail digital money.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Skills as a Measure of Human Capital: Evidence from LinkedIn Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure human capital using the self-reported skill sets of 8.75 million U.S. college graduates from professional profiles on the online platform LinkedIn. We establish that these skills are systematically related to human capital investments such as different types of schooling and work experience. The average profile of the number of reported skills by age looks remarkably similar to the well-established concave age-earnings profiles. More experienced workers and those with higher educational degrees have larger shares of occupation-specific skills, consistent with their acquisition through professional-degree programs and on-the-job experience. Workers who report more, and particularly more specific and managerial, skills are more likely to hold highly paid jobs. Skill differences across workers can account for more earnings variation than detailed vectors of education and experience. We also document a substantial gender gap in reported skills, which starts to manifest when young women reach typical ages of first motherhood. Gender differences in skill profiles can rationalize a substantial proportion of the gender gap in the propensity to work in highly paid jobs. Overall, the results are consistent with an important role of multidimensional skills in accounting for several well-known basic labor-market patterns.</description>

      <title>Effects of AI Feedback on Learning, the Skill Gap, and Intellectual Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can human decision-makers learn from AI feedback? Using data on 52,000 decision-makers from a large online chess platform, we investigate how their AI use affects three interrelated long-term outcomes: Learning, skill gap, and diversity of decision strategies. First, we show that individuals are far more likely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success rather than failure. This AI feedback seeking strategy turns out to be detrimental to learning: Feedback on successes decreases future performance, while feedback on failures increases it. Second, higher-skilled decision-makers seek AI feedback more often and are far more likely to seek AI feedback after a failure, and benefit more from AI feedback than lower-skilled individuals. As a result, access to AI feedback increases, rather than decreases, the skill gap between high- and low-skilled individuals. Finally, we leverage 42 major platform updates as natural experiments to show that access to AI feedback causes a decrease in intellectual diversity of the population as individuals tend to specialize in the same areas. Together, those results indicate that learning from AI feedback is not automatic and using AI correctly seems to be a skill itself. Furthermore, despite its individual-level benefits, access to AI feedback can have significant population-level downsides including loss of intellectual diversity and an increasing skill gap.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Macroeconomic Dynamics using a Calibrated Data-Driven Agent-based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, economic agent-based models have made the transition from qualitative models calibrated to match stylised facts to quantitative models for time series forecasting, and in some cases, their predictions have performed as well or better than those of standard models (see, e.g. Poledna et al. (2023a); Hommes et al. (2022); Pichler et al. (2022)). Here, we build on the model of Poledna et al., adding several new features such as housing markets, realistic synthetic populations of individuals with income, wealth and consumption heterogeneity, enhanced behavioural rules and market mechanisms, and an enhanced credit market. We calibrate our model for all 38 OECD member countries using state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian inference methods and test it by making out-of-sample forecasts. It outperforms both the Poledna and AR(1) time series models by a highly statistically significant margin. Our model is built within a platform we have developed, making it easy to build, run, and evaluate alternative models, which we hope will encourage future work in this area.</description>

      <title>Can AI Enhance its Creativity to Beat Humans ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity is a fundamental pillar of human expression and a driving force behind innovation, yet it now stands at a crossroads. As artificial intelligence advances at an astonishing pace, the question arises: can machines match and potentially surpass human creativity? This study investigates the creative performance of artificial intelligence (AI) compared to humans by analyzing the effects of two distinct prompting strategies (a Naive and an Expert AI) on AI and across three different tasks (Text, Draw and Alternative Uses tasks). Human external evaluators have scored creative outputs generated by humans and AI, and these subjective creative scores were complemented with objective measures based on quantitative measurements and NLP tools. The results reveal that AI generally outperforms humans in creative tasks, though this advantage is nuanced by the specific nature of each task and the chosen creativity criteria. Ultimately, while AI demonstrates superior performance in certain creative domains, our results suggest that integrating human feedback is crucial for maximizing AI's creative potential.</description>

      <title>VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM) to instill human expectations into LLMs. While preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we see the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of the preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-efficient for fine-tuning LLMs by concentrating on high-quality feedback.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Sovereign Credit Rating Downgrade on the US Equity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study was to examine the impact of the US sovereign credit rating downgrade on its equity market. Utilizing the event study methodology, a sample of three most capitalized listed companies -- Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon -- and the equity market index -- S&amp;P500 -- were used as the proxy for the overall equity market. Three market models were constructed within the estimation window to determine the expected daily returns on the selected companies stocks. The result showed that the sovereign credit rating downgrade of the US government debt did not have any significant effects on the US equity market.</description>
