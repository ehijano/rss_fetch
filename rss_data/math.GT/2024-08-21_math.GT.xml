      <title>Disk patterns, quasi-duality and the uniform bounded diameter conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the diameter of the image of the skinning map on the deformation space of an acylindrical reflection group is bounded by a constant depending only on the topological complexity of the components of its boundary, answering a conjecture of Minsky in the reflection group setting. This result can be interpreted as a uniform rigidity theorem for disk patterns. Our method also establishes a connection between the diameter of the skinning image and certain discrete extremal width on the Coxeter graph of the reflection group.</description>

      <title>Locally flat embeddings of 3-manifolds in $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M. Freedman showed that every homology 3-sphere embeds as a locally flat submanifold of $S^4$. This is in striking contrast to the state of our knowledge of smooth embeddings of homology spheres. This book surveys what is presently known about the topic of its title, with emphasis on embeddings of Seifert fibred 3-manifolds and on distinguishing embeddings by properties of the complementary regions. In the final chapters 4-dimension surgery is used to study embeddings in which the complementary regions have abelian or nilpotent fundamental groups, and the final appendix contains a number of open questions. Work on smooth embeddings is only described briefly, as current techniques in this area are beyond the author's expertise.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz existence problem and fiber products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With each holomorphic map $f: R \rightarrow \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ between compact Riemann surfaces one can associate a combinatorial datum consisting of the genus $g$ of $R$, the degree $n$ of $f$, the number $q$ of branching points of $f$, and the $q$ partitions of $n$ given by the local degrees of $f$ at the preimages of the branching points. These quantities are related by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and the Hurwitz existence problem asks whether a combinatorial datum that fits this formula actually corresponds to some $f$. In this paper, using results and techniques related to fiber products of holomorphic maps between compact Riemann surfaces, we prove a number of results that enable us to uniformly explain the non-realizability of many previously known non-realizable branch data, and to construct a large amount of new such data. We also deduce from our results the theorem of Halphen, proven in 1880, concerning polynomial solutions of the equation $A(z)^a+B(z)^b=C(z)^c$, where $a,b,c$ are integers greater than one.</description>

      <title>Half grid diagrams and Thompson links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define half grid diagrams and prove every link is half grid presentable by constructing a canonical half grid pair (which gives rise to a grid diagram of some special type) associated with an element in the oriented Thompson group. We show that this half grid construction is equivalent to Jones' construction of oriented Thompson links. Using this equivalence, we relate the (oriented) Thompson index to several classical topological link invariants, and give both the lower and upper bounds of the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of a knot in terms of the oriented Thompson index. Moreover, we give a one-to-one correspondence between half grid diagrams and elements in symmetric groups and give a new description of link group using two elements in a symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Distributional Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of closed manifolds to be maximum, i.e., equal to their classical LS-category (cat). This gives us many new computations of dcat, especially for essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the dcat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish various criteria for the inertness of the top cell attachments of Poincar\'{e} duality complexes through nonzero degree maps, algebraic intersection theory and various types of homotopy fibrations. Many examples are provided, including specific surgery, homogeneous spaces and low dimensional manifolds. Additionally, we propose eight open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify topological $4$-manifolds with boundary and fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}$, under some assumptions on the boundary. We apply this to classify surfaces in simply-connected $4$-manifolds with $S^3$ boundary, where the fundamental group of the surface complement is $\mathbb{Z}$. We then compare these homeomorphism classifications with the smooth setting. For manifolds, we show that every Hermitian form over $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]$ arises as the equivariant intersection form of a pair of exotic smooth 4-manifolds with boundary and fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}$. For surfaces we have a similar result, and in particular we show that every $2$-handlebody with $S^3$ boundary contains a pair of exotic discs.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic and satellite Lorenz links obtained by twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lorenz link is equivalent to a T-link, which is a positive braid built by concatenating torus braids of increasing size. When each torus braid except the largest is obtained by full twists, then the T-link can be described as the Dehn filling of a parent link. In this paper, we completely classify when such parent links are hyperbolic. This gives a classification of the geometry of T-links obtained by full twists when the amount of twisting is large, although the bound on the number of required twists is not effective. We also present effective results on hyperbolicity for two families of T-links obtained by twisting, even when the number of twists is small. Finally, we identify families of satellite T-links obtained by half-twists.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the Delaunay triangulations of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proved a rigidity result for Delaunay triangulations of the plane under Luo's discrete conformal change, extending previous results on hexagonal triangulations. Our result is a discrete analogue of the conformal rigidity of the plane. We followed Zhengxu He's analytical approach in his work on the rigidity of disk patterns, and developed a discrete Schwarz lemma and a discrete Liouville theorem. The main tools include conformal modulus, discrete extremal length, and maximum principles in discrete conformal geometry.</description>

      <title>Compatible Relative Lefschetz Fibrations On Admissible Relative Stein Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For more than two decades it has been known that any compact Stein surface (of real dimension four) admits a compatible Lefschetz fibration over a two-disk. More recently, Giroux and Pardon have generalized this result by giving a complex geometric proof for the existence of compatible Lefschetz fibrations on Stein domains of any even dimension. As a preparatory step in proving the former, Akbulut and Ozbagci have shown that there exist infinitely many pairwise non-equivalent Lefschetz fibrations on the four-ball by using a result of Lyon constructing fibrations on the complements of (p,q)-torus links in the three-sphere. In this paper, we first extend this result to obtain compatible Lefschetz fibrations on the six-ball whose pages are (p, q, 2)-Brieskorn varieties, and then construct a compatible 'relative' Lefschetz fibrations on any Stein domain (of dimension six) which admit a certain ('admissible') 'relative Stein pair' structure. In particular, we provide a purely topological proof for the existence of Lefschetz fibrations on specific 6-dimensional Stein domains.</description>

      <title>On the invariance of the string topology coproduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a variant of Naef's formula for the failure of invariance of the string topology coproduct under homotopy equivalences, using an obstruction class build from the higher homotopy data one can associate to a homotopy equivalence as well as the ``fake diagonal''. The vanishing of our obstruction class can be seen as a way to measure a form of smallness for homotopy equivalences. We show that the same obstruction rules the failure of invariance for a generalisation of the coproduct to higher dimensional loops.</description>

      <title>Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.00164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds. In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups satisfying this condition may be represented by irreducible train track maps in the sense of Bestvina-Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs). Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well. Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass-Serre theory of groups acting on trees, morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof. We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument of Qing-Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic. As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin: outer automorphisms of finitely-generated word hyperbolic groups satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen-Thurston "periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov." At the end of the thesis we collect some open problems we find interesting.</description>
