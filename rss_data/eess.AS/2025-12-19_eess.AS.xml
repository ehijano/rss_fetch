      <title>Learning Recursive Attenuation Filters Under Noisy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursion is a fundamental concept in the design of filters and audio systems. In particular, artificial reverberation systems that use delay networks depend on recursive paths to control both echo density and the decay rate of modal components. The differentiable digital signal processing framework has shown promise in automatically tuning both recursive and non-recursive elements given a target room impulse response. This is done by applying gradient descent to loss functions based on energy-decay or spectrogram differences. However, these representations are highly sensitive to background noise, which is ubiquitous in real measurements, producing spurious loss minima and leading to incorrect attenuation. This paper addresses the problem of tuning recursive attenuation filters of a feedback delay network when targets are noisy. We examine the loss landscape associated with different optimization objectives and propose a method that ensures correct minima under low signal-to-noise conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through statistical analysis on 80 individual optimization examples. The results reveal that explicitly modeling the noise restores correct minima. Furthermore, we identify the sensitivity of attenuation filter parameters tuning to perturbations in frequency-independent parameters. These findings provide practical guidelines for more robust and reproducible gradient-based optimization of feedback delay networks.</description>

      <title>BEST-STD2.0: Balanced and Efficient Speech Tokenizer for Spoken Term Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate spoken content retrieval is vital for applications such as voice search. Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection (STD) involves retrieving matching segments from an audio database given a spoken query. Token-based STD systems, which use discrete speech representations, enable efficient search but struggle with robustness to noise and reverberation, and with inefficient token utilization. We address these challenges by proposing a noise and reverberation-augmented training strategy to improve tokenizer robustness. In addition, we introduce optimal transport-based regularization to ensure balanced token usage and enhance token efficiency. To further speed up retrieval, we adopt a TF-IDF-based search mechanism. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms STD baselines across various distortion levels while maintaining high search efficiency.</description>

      <title>Poster: Recognizing Hidden-in-the-Ear Private Key for Reliable Silent Speech Interface Using Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silent speech interface (SSI) enables hands-free input without audible vocalization, but most SSI systems do not verify speaker identity. We present HEar-ID, which uses consumer active noise-canceling earbuds to capture low-frequency "whisper" audio and high-frequency ultrasonic reflections. Features from both streams pass through a shared encoder, producing embeddings that feed a contrastive branch for user authentication and an SSI head for silent spelling recognition. This design supports decoding of 50 words while reliably rejecting impostors, all on commodity earbuds with a single model. Experiments demonstrate that HEar-ID achieves strong spelling accuracy and robust authentication.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Cepstrum: Pitch Modification for Mel-Based Neural Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method that can be applied to any mel-spectrogram representation. As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods.</description>

      <title>Optimizing tiny colorless feedback delay networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common bane of artificial reverberation algorithms is spectral coloration in the synthesized sound, typically manifesting as metallic ringing, leading to a degradation in the perceived sound quality. In delay network methods, coloration is more pronounced when fewer delay lines are used. This paper presents an optimization framework in which a tiny differentiable feedback delay network, with as few as four delay lines, is used to learn a set of parameters to iteratively reduce coloration. The parameters under optimization include the feedback matrix, as well as the input and output gains. The optimization objective is twofold: to maximize spectral flatness through a spectral loss while maintaining temporal density by penalizing sparseness in the parameter values. A favorable narrow distribution of modal excitation is achieved while maintaining the desired impulse response density. In a subjective assessment, the new method proves effective in reducing perceptual coloration of late reverberation. Compared to the author's previous work, which serves as the baseline and utilizes a sparsity loss in the time domain, the proposed method achieves computational savings while maintaining performance. The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated through two application scenarios where smooth-sounding synthetic room impulse responses are obtained via the introduction of attenuation filters and an optimizable scattering feedback matrix.</description>

      <title>Similarity Metrics For Late Reverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic tuning of reverberation algorithms relies on the optimization of a cost function. While general audio similarity metrics are useful, they are not optimized for the specific statistical properties of reverberation in rooms. This paper presents two novel metrics for assessing the similarity of late reverberation in room impulse responses. These metrics are differentiable and can be utilized within a machine-learning framework. We compare the performance of these metrics to two popular audio metrics using a large dataset of room impulse responses encompassing various room configurations and microphone positions. The results indicate that the proposed functions based on averaged power and frequency-band energy decay outperform the baselines with the former exhibiting the most suitable profile towards the minimum. The proposed work holds promise as an improvement to the design and evaluation of reverberation similarity metrics.</description>

      <title>Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the evaluation aspect being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.</description>

      <title>Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. We release an online demo at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/, with plans to release the full dataset in the near future. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.</description>
