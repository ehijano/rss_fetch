      <title>Non-linear stability analysis of slip in a single-degree-of-freedom elastic system with frictional evolution laws spanning aging to slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-linear stability analysis of quasi-static slip in a spring-block model. The sliding interface is governed by rate- and state-dependent friction, with an intermediate state evolution law that spans between aging and slip laws using a dimensionless parameter \epsilon. Our results extend and generalize previous findings of Gu et al. (1984) and Ranjith and Rice (1999) that considered slip and aging laws, respectively. We examine the robustness of these prior results to changes in the evolution law, including the finding of unconditional stability of the aging law for spring stiffnesses above a critical value. Our analysis provides analytical trajectories of slip motion in a phase plane as function of dimensionless governing parameters. We investigate two scenarios: a spring-block model with stationary and non-stationary point loading rate. When the loading point is stationary, we find that deviations from the aging law lead to only conditional stability of the slider for spring stiffnesses above a critical value: finite perturbations can trigger instability, consistent with prior results for the slip law. We quantify these critical perturbations as a function of the governing parameters. We find that, for a given supercritical stiffness, the size of the perturbation required to induce instability grows as the state evolution law approaches the aging law. In contrast, when the point loading rate is stationary, our results suggest that there exists a maximum critical stiffness above which an instability can never develop, for any perturbation size. This critical stiffness is \epsilon-dependent and vanishes as the slip law is approached: conditional stability is then expected in the slip law limit. Finally, we derive relations for an effective spring stiffness as a function of the elastic moduli and a characteristic fault dimension or a characteristic perturbation wavelength.</description>

      <title>CDDIP: Constrained Diffusion-Driven Deep Image Prior for Seismic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data frequently exhibits missing traces, substantially affecting subsequent seismic processing and interpretation. Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in reconstructing irregularly missing seismic data through supervised and unsupervised methods. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain, such as generalization capacity and computation time cost during the inference. Our work introduces a reconstruction method that uses a pre-trained generative diffusion model for image synthesis and incorporates Deep Image Prior (DIP) to maintain data consistency when reconstructing missing traces in seismic images. The proposed method has demonstrated strong robustness and high reconstruction capability for field and synthetic seismic images with different levels of structural complexity, even in scenarios where test images were outside the training domain. This indicates that our method can handle the high geological variability of different exploration targets. Additionally, compared to other state-of-the-art seismic reconstruction methods using diffusion models, our approach reduces the number of neural function evaluations by up to 4x.</description>

      <title>Upscaling transport in heterogeneous media featuring local-scale dispersion: flow channeling, macro-retardation and parameter prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theoretical treatments of transport in heterogeneous Darcy flows consider advection only. When local-scale dispersion is neglected, flux-weighting persists over time; mean Lagrangian and Eulerian flow velocity distributions relate simply to each other and to the variance of the underlying hydraulic conductivity field. Local-scale dispersion complicates this relationship, potentially causing initially flux-weighted solute to experience lower-velocity regions as well as Taylor-type macrodispersion due to transverse solute movement between adjacent streamlines. To investigate the interplay of local-scale dispersion with conductivity log-variance, correlation length, and anisotropy, we perform a Monte Carlo study of flow and advective-dispersive transport in spatially-periodic 2D Darcy flows in large-scale, high-resolution multivariate Gaussian random conductivity fields. We observe flow channeling at all heterogeneity levels and quantify its extent. We find evidence for substantial effective retardation in the upscaled system, associated with increased flow channeling, and observe limited Taylor-type macrodispersion, which we physically explain. A quasi-constant Lagrangian velocity is achieved within a short distance of release, allowing usage of a simplified continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model we previously proposed in which the transition time distribution is understood as a temporal mapping of unit time in an equivalent system with no flow heterogeneity. The numerical data set is modeled with such a CTRW; we show how dimensionless parameters defining the CTRW transition time distribution are predicted by dimensionless heterogeneity statistics and provide empirical equations for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of alkali feldspar solid solutions with varying Al-Si order: atomistic simulations using a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic mixing properties of alkali feldspar solid solutions between the Na and K end members were computed through atomistic simulations using a neural network potential. We performed combined molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble at 800 {\deg}C and considered three quenched disorder states in the Al-Si-O framework ranging from fully ordered to fully disordered. The excess Gibbs energy of mixing, excess enthalpy of mixing and excess entropy of mixing are in good agreement with literature data. In particular, the notion that increasing disorder in the Al-Si-O framework correlates with increasing ideality of Na-K mixing is successfully predicted. Finally, a recently proposed short range ordering of Na and K in the alkali sublattice is observed, which may be considered as a precursor to exsolution lamellae, a characteristic phenomenon in alkali feldspar of intermediate composition leading to perthite formation during cooling.</description>
