      <title>Genetic Diversity Assessment of German Chamomile Populations Based on Phenotypic Detection and SSR Molecular Markers in Bushehr Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity in 42 German chamomile populations using morphological, biochemical, and ssr molecular markers, in both field and laboratory sections. Different populations of German chamomile collected from different regions were as statistical populations. Phenological, physiological and phytochemical traits, were measured. DNA extraction was done by CTAB method and DNA quantity and quality were checked by spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis. 5 target populations were genetically evaluated with the help of 6 SSR markers. According to the obtained results, Jam 1 and Shahijan populations had the most effective substances (essential oil and chamazulene). The correlation analysis revealed a positive and significant correlation of 59% between the percentage of chamazulene and the percentage of essential oil. Chamazulene percentage and fresh weight as the most important traits were entered into the regression model step by step. These traits were found to explain 0.43% of the changes in the data. These findings have significant implications for future research aimed at identifying the most effective populations for essential oil and chamazulene production. The cluster analysis divided the genotypes into five groups. The second group was the most important, and Jam1 and Shahijan genotypes were in this group. The results of the molecular analysis showed that the Seho Sermak-Dashti population had the most effective allele, and this population was superior to other populations in terms of Shannon's index and nei diversity coefficient. According to the diagram, analysis into main coordinates showed that the genotypes are scattered on the surface of the diagram and this indicates the appropriate diversity of the studied genotypes. As a result, it can be stated that the grouping of phenotypic and molecular data was very consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Comparison of Petri Net and Ordinary Differential Equation SIR Component Models</title>

Abstract: Petri Nets are an increasingly used modeling framework for the spread of disease across populations or within an individual. For example, the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model is foundational for population epidemiological modeling and has been implemented in several prior Petri Net studies. While the SIR model is typically expressed as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), with continuous time and variables, Petri Nets operate as discrete event simulations with deterministic or stochastic timings. We present the first systematic study of the numerical convergence of two distinct Petri Net implementations of the SIRS compartment model relative to the standard ODE. In particular, we introduce a novel deterministic implementation of the SIRS model using dynamic transition weights in the GPenSIM package and stochastic Petri Net models using SPIKE. We show how rescaling and rounding procedures are critical for the numerical convergence of Petri Net SIR models relative to the ODEs, and we achieve a relative root mean squared error of less than 1% compared to ODE simulations for biologically relevant parameter ranges. Our findings confirm that both stochastic and deterministic discrete time Petri Nets are valid for modeling SIR-type dynamics with appropriate numerical procedures, laying the foundations for larger-scale use of Petri Net models.</description>

      <title>A Field Biology Guide for the Curious Physicist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fieldwork is an essential component not just for organismal biology but also for the expanding umbrella of disciplines that have turned their attention toward the physics of living systems. Observing organisms in nature is a critical component of discovery; however, conducting field research can be a barrier for scientists who do not have experience working with organisms under challenging field conditions. Here, we propose 7 critical steps for organizing and executing interdisciplinary, curiosity-driven field research. Our steps are drawn from insights gained from the in Situ Jungle Biomechanics Lab (JBL), a field research course that helps early-career scientists from both physical and life sciences gain experience in both organizing and conducting interdisciplinary field research in the Amazon Rainforest. We emphasize a curiosity-driven approach towards the scientific inquiry of living systems, one we believe is crucial for discovery while working with wild organisms under highly unpredictable field conditions. We further provide guidance on teamwork when conducting fieldwork, including creating an inclusive environment and advocating for codes of conduct and team structures that aid in conflict resolution. Finally, we outline what we call the in situ approach to fieldwork, one that requires engagements with the environment, scientific community, and local peoples where field sites exist.</description>
