      <title>BEOL Ferroelectric Compute-in-Memory Ising Machine for Simulated Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems are pervasive in science and engineering, yet their NP-hard nature renders them increasingly inefficient to solve on conventional von Neumann architectures as problem size grows. Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform. Across Max-Cut instances with up to 100,000 nodes, the proposed hardware-software co-designed solver achieves up to a 175.9x speedup over a GPU-based simulated bifurcation implementation while consistently delivering superior solution quality.</description>

      <title>Designing Virtual Reality Games for Grief: A Workshop Approach with Mental Health Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although serious games have been increasingly used for mental health applications, few explicitly address coping with grief as a core mechanic and narrative experience for patients. Existing grief-related digital games often focus on clinical training for medical professionals rather than immersive storytelling and agency in emotional processing for the patient. In response, we designed Road to Acceptance, a VR game that presents grief through first-person narrative and gameplay. As the next phase of evaluation, we propose a workshop-based study with 12 licensed mental health professionals to assess the therapeutic impacts of the game and the alignment with best practices in grief education and interventions. This will inform iterative game design and patient evaluation methods, ensuring that the experience is clinically appropriate. Potential findings can contribute to the design principles of grief-related virtual reality experiences, bridging the gap between interactive media, mental health interventions, and immersive storytelling.</description>

      <title>M2RU: Memristive Minion Recurrent Unit for Continual Learning at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning on edge platforms remains challenging because recurrent networks depend on energy-intensive training procedures and frequent data movement that are impractical for embedded deployments. This work introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal architecture that implements the minion recurrent unit for efficient temporal processing with on-chip continual learning. The architecture integrates weighted-bit streaming, which enables multi-bit digital inputs to be processed in crossbars without high-resolution conversion, and an experience replay mechanism that stabilizes learning under domain shifts. M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence.</description>

      <title>Upgrading Democracies with Fairer Voting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design elements of democracies. Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite significance and interdisciplinary scientific progress, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. We rigorously evaluate the striking voting outcomes of these fair voting methods in a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, including past and follow-up evidence. Results show more winning projects with the same budget. They also show broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented. We provide causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very specialized technical explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with the momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies globally.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell transcriptomes: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>TreeVQA: A Tree-Structured Execution Framework for Shot Reduction in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.</description>
