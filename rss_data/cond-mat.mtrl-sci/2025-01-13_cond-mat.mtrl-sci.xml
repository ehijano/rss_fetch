      <title>Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A reduced-temperature process for preparing atomically clean Si(100) and SiGe(100) surfaces with vapor HF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon processing techniques such as atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) and epitaxial growth require surface preparations that activate oxide desorption (typically &gt;1000 $^{\circ}$C) and promote surface reconstruction toward atomically-clean, flat, and ordered Si(100)-2$\times$1. We compare aqueous and vapor phase cleaning of Si and Si/SiGe surfaces to prepare APAM-ready and epitaxy-ready surfaces at lower temperatures. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that vapor hydrogen fluoride (VHF) cleans dramatically reduce carbon surface contamination and allow the chemically prepared surface to reconstruct at lower temperatures, 600 $^{\circ}$C for Si and 580 $^{\circ}$C for a Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures, into an ordered atomic terrace structure indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After thermal treatment and vacuum hydrogen termination, we demonstrate STM hydrogen desorption lithography (HDL) on VHF-treated Si samples, creating reactive zones that enable area-selective chemistry using a thermal budget similar to CMOS process flows. We anticipate these results will establish new pathways to integrate APAM with Si foundry processing.</description>

      <title>Atomic-resolution structural and spectroscopic evidence for the synthetic realization of two-dimensional copper boride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first realization of borophene on Ag(111), two-dimensional (2D) boron nanomaterials have attracted significant interest due to their polymorphic diversity and potential for hosting solid-state quantum phenomena. Here, we use atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and field-emission resonance (FER) spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and properties of atomically thin boron phases grown on Cu(111). Specifically, FER spectroscopy reveals unique charge transfer and electronic states compared to the distinct borophene phases observed on silver, suggesting that the deposition of boron on copper can result in strong covalent bonding characteristic of a 2D copper boride. This conclusion is reinforced by detailed STM characterization of line defects that are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for atomically thin Cu8B14. This evidence for 2D copper boride is likely to motivate future synthetic efforts aimed at expanding the relatively unexplored family of atomically thin metal boride materials.</description>

      <title>Structural transition and emission enhancement in vacancy ordered halide double perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of pressure on the structural evolution, enhancement of photoluminescence intensity and optical band gap of a vacancy ordered double halide perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ is investigated systematically. We use synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, optical band gap and photoluminescence measurements to explore the structural and the optical properties of Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure up to 30.0 GPa. We find that Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ undergoes a structural transition from cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m to monoclinic P2$_1$/n at very low pressure below 1.0 GPa. A significant increase in photoluminescence intensity and a rapid decrease in optical band gap are observed, which are related to the octahedral distortion and structural transition. Interestingly, with increasing pressure, the sample regains its ambient Fm$\bar{3}$m structure at around 3.4 GPa maintaining the cubic phase up to 30.0 GPa. The sample undergoes an iso-structural transition at around 14.1 GPa pressure with a slight decrease in compressibility.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-thick GaN/AlGaN quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm thick GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Mangnon-Phonon-Photon Interactions in Cubic Ferromagnets in the Vicinity of Orientational Phase Transition: Retrospective and Phenomenological Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnon-phonon-photon interactions in cubic ferromagnets near orientational phase transitions (OPT). The study focuses on the interplay of magnetoelastic (ME), electromagnetic-spin (EMS), and acousticelectromagnetic (AEM) interactions in ferromagnetic dielectrics and metals. By deriving dispersion equations for coupled waves, the research reveals how the dynamic properties of magnetically ordered crystals evolve in response to these interactions under varying external magnetic fields and near OPT points. The ME interaction prominently influences spin and elastic wave dynamics, giving rise to coupled modes such as quasimagnon and quasi-acoustic waves. Near the OPT, these interactions become dominant, leading to phenomena like the magnetoelastic gap and softening of vibrational modes. The EMS interaction significantly alters the activation energy and dispersion of quasi-spin and quasi-electromagnetic waves. In ferromagnetic metals, helicons (weakly damped electromagnetic waves) exhibit strong coupling with spin and elastic waves, particularly in the OPT region. The study identifies conditions for triple resonance among spin, elastic, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, it explores the frequency-dependent rotation of polarization planes in electromagnetic and magnetoelastic waves, which sharpens near OPT points. These results provide a deeper understanding of the coupled dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, paving the way for new technological applications in spintronics, signal processing, and advanced magneto-optical devices. The theoretical framework developed here emphasizes the critical role of ME, EMS, and AEM interactions in tailoring wave properties for specific applications, particularly in designing next-generation magnetic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetism based on nitrate-nitrate interactions: The cases of LiNO$_3$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range magnetic ordering of the orbital motion of oxygen atoms within NO$_3$$^-$ cations is identified from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$($T$) in LiNO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$ at their respective order-disorder, solid-solid phase transitions $T$$_N$. The observed sharp changes in $\chi$($T$) and accompanying hysteretic behavior indicate the phase transitions to be first order. A model employing the law of conservation of angular momentum is used to explain why the librations between neighboring NO$_3$$^-$ become geared below $T$$_N$. Since the periodic motions involve concerted motion of net charges, the associated magnetic moments of the NO$_3$$^-$ ions indirectly establish an antiferromagnetic structure below $T$$_N$. Our findings identify a previously unidentified type of molecular interaction which may be exploited to further increase the enthalpy of the widely-popular hydrated salts employed as energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Hexatic Phase in Covalent Two-Dimensional Silver Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-crystal-like hexatic phase. While experiments have confirmed the KTHNY melting scenario in some 2D systems such as crystals of skyrmions and of noble gas atoms, no evidence has previously been found for it in covalently bonded 2D crystals. Here, 2D crystals of silver iodide embedded in multi-layer graphene are studied with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Near the melting point, a highly dynamic state of AgI emerges that we show to be the first observation of the hexatic phase in covalent 2D materials.</description>

      <title>First-principles Investigation of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$: A Multifunctional Heteroanionic Oxychalcogenide for Photocatalytic and Thermoelectric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of industrial growth raises global energy demand. Novel materials with promising unorthodox features satiate and demand for sustainable, non-toxic, and cost-effective energy. A first-principles investigation were carried out to ground state and transport properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ towards energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications was carried out. In groundstate the CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ showed good mechanically stable with a volume of \(1138.235 \, \text{\AA}^3\) and a high elastic modulus of \(215.73 \, \text{GPa}\). Further, the electronic properties of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\), PBE-GGA exchange-correlation was utilized, demonstrates direct and indirect transitions with a wide bandgap of 2.7 and 2.8 eV, indicating its semiconducting nature. Photoinduced charge carriers were investigated through Deformation Potential Theory (DPT) to estimate the mobility of charge carriers, excitonic radius, and effective mass. Axial anisotropic strain in band degeneracy and shifts in the S-Y and Y-\Gamma transitions offer a \(3.17 \, \text{\AA}\) Frenkel-type strongly bound exciton with a high carrier mobility of \(2409.91 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) electrons and \(316.46 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) holes respectively. To estimate the feasibility of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) in photocatalysis, we examined the conduction and valence band edges under harsh pH conditions within PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functionals. The band edges of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) show the halfway reaction for hydrogen evolution with reference to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE). Moreover, the Boltzmann equation interface was used to investigate the transport and thermoelectric properties. A high Seebeck coefficient in \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) at \(300 \, \text{K}\) directs a thermoelectric figure of merit of \(0.94\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenides provide an unique intrinsic entanglement between the spin/valley/orbital degrees of freedom and the polarization of scattered photons. This scenario gives rise to the well-assessed optical dichroism observed by using both steady and time-resolved probes. In this paper we provide a compact analytical modelling of the onset of a finite Faraday/Kerr optical rotation upon shining with a circularly polarized light. We identify different optical features displaying optical rotation at different characteristic energies, and we describe in an analytical framework the time-dependence of their intensities as a consequence of the main spin-conserving and spin-flip processes.</description>

      <title>Observation of transverse Thomson effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of sustainable energy materials via the machine-learned material space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does a machine learning model actually gain an understanding of the material space? We answer this question in the affirmative on the example of the OptiMate model, a graph attention network trained to predict the optical properties of semiconductors and insulators. By applying the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique to its latent embeddings, we demonstrate that the model captures a nuanced and interpretable representation of the materials space, reflecting chemical and physical principles, without any user-induced bias. This enables clustering of almost 10,000 materials based on optical properties and chemical similarities. Beyond this understanding, we demonstrate how the learned material space can be used to identify more sustainable alternatives to critical materials in energy-related technologies, such as photovoltaics. These findings demonstrate the dual utility of machine learning models in materials science: Accurately predicting material properties while providing insights into the underlying materials space. The approach demonstrates the broader potential of leveraging learned materials spaces for the discovery and design of materials for diverse applications, and is easily applicable to any state-of-the-art machine learning model.</description>

      <title>Evaluating SCAN and r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functionals for predicting transition temperatures in antiferromagnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in exchange-correlation functionals within density functional theory highlight the need for rigorous validation across diverse types of materials properties. In this study, we assess the performance of the newly developed meta-GGA r$^2$SCAN and its predecessor, SCAN, in predicting the N\'eel transition temperature of antiferromagnetic materials. Our analysis includes 48 magnetic materials, spanning both simple and complex systems. Using DFT, we compute the energies of various magnetic configurations and extract exchange interaction parameters through a least-squares fitting approach. These parameters are then used in classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the transition temperatures. Our results demonstrate that both SCAN and r$^2$SCAN greatly outperform standard GGA and GGA+$U$ methods, yielding predictions that closely align with experimental values. The Pearson correlation coefficients for SCAN and r$^2$SCAN are 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, when compared to experimental transition temperatures. Additionally, we calculate the energy differences between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations to assess the performance of the hybrid HSE06 functional. We found that the HSE06 functional underestimates transition temperatures compared to the meta-GGA functionals and experimental values.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Glucose Oxidation Activity of Anodized Copper Films on Microfabricated Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glucose oxidation is a key reaction in biosensing and energy conversion, with anodized copper electrodes showing great potential as catalysts for its enhancement. This study explores the relationship between anodization parameters and glucose oxidation on thin copper films, providing valuable insights for optimization. By adjusting anodization parameters, specific species such as Cu2O, Cu(OH)2, and CuO can be selectively formed, each exhibiting different catalytic activities. Applying polarization in 1 M KOH at 0 V (vs Ag|AgCl) generates a highly active CuO surface layer, leading to significant performance improvements over bare copper electrodes. Specifically, sensitivity increases by 55% in the 0.1 mM-0.5 mM range and 73% in the 0.75 mM-2 mM range. Additionally, the electrodes demonstrate an exceptionally low detection limit of just 0.004 mM. These results are attributed to scalable, reproducible manufacturing on cleanroom-compatible platforms. This study not only sheds light on the effects of thin copper film anodization on glucose oxidation but also provides a practical approach for enhancing the efficiency of copper-based systems in biosensing and energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>The coupling of polarization and oxygen vacancy migration in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films enables electrically controlled thermal memories above room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric thin films as potential candidates to be used as non-volatile electric-field-modulated thermal memories. The electric-field dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/YSZ devices is found to be hysteretic, resembling the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops, being maximum (minimum) at large applied positive (negative) voltages from the top metallic electrode. This dynamic thermal response is compatible with the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the oxygen ion migration, in which the oxygen vacancies are the main phonon scattering sources and the polarization acts as an electrically active ion migration barrier that creates the hysteresis. This new mechanism enables two non-volatile thermal states: high (ON) and low (OFF) thermal conductivity, with an ON/OFF ratio of 1.6. Both the ON and OFF states exhibit high stability over time, though the switching speed is limited by ion mobility in the YSZ electrode.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Dataset for Ti and Ti-6Al-4V</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium and its alloys are technologically important materials that display a rich phase behaviour. In order to enable large-scale, realistic modelling of Ti and its alloys on the atomistic scale, Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are crucial, but rely on databases of atomic configurations. We report databases of such configurations that represent the {\alpha}, \b{eta}, {\omega} and liquid phases of Ti and the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, where we provide total energy, force and stress values evaluated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the PBE exchange-correlation functional. We have also leveraged and extended a data reduction strategy, via non-diagonal supercells, for the vibrational properties of Ti and sampling of atomic species within bulk crystalline data for Ti-6Al-4V. These configurations may be used to fit MLIP models that can accurately model the phase behaviour of Ti and Ti-6Al-4V across a broad range of thermodynamic conditions. To validate models, we assembled a set of benchmark protocols, which can be used to rapidly develop and evaluate MLIP models. We demonstrated the utility of our databases and validation tools by fitting models based on the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) frameworks.</description>

      <title>Neural Architecture Codesign for Fast Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a pipeline to streamline neural architecture codesign for physics applications to reduce the need for ML expertise when designing models for novel tasks. Our method employs neural architecture search and network compression in a two-stage approach to discover hardware efficient models. This approach consists of a global search stage that explores a wide range of architectures while considering hardware constraints, followed by a local search stage that fine-tunes and compresses the most promising candidates. We exceed performance on various tasks and show further speedup through model compression techniques such as quantization-aware-training and neural network pruning. We synthesize the optimal models to high level synthesis code for FPGA deployment with the hls4ml library. Additionally, our hierarchical search space provides greater flexibility in optimization, which can easily extend to other tasks and domains. We demonstrate this with two case studies: Bragg peak finding in materials science and jet classification in high energy physics, achieving models with improved accuracy, smaller latencies, or reduced resource utilization relative to the baseline models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state systems.We present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enables comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall effect by tilt of Zeeman field in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the anomalous Hall effect of topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$, and the electronic structure in the presence of magnetic proximity effect is theoretically investigated. The theoretical analysis is performed in two different ways: an effective model and a multi-orbital tight-binding model generated from the first-principles band structure. These two theoretical methods provided the similar profile of Berry curvature for electronic states near the bulk band gap, and they show an unconventional rise of hollowed-out peak in the profile with the tilt of proximity magnetic potential. The anomalous Hall conductivity is also calculated as a function of the charge density and the tilt angle of proximity magnetic order. Then, an unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by the tilt of magnetic order is theoretically predicted as a result of the variation of Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the boson peak and first sharp diffraction peak in glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson peak (BP) dynamics refers to the universal excitation in the terahertz region of glass. In this study, the universal dynamics of BP were quantitatively evaluated in various glassy materials based on the heterogeneous elasticity theory (HET), and the determinants of BP were successfully extracted. A strong correlation was observed between the maximum possible coarse-graining wavenumber, which is a determinant of the BP in the HET, and the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) wavenumber, which is a characteristic index of the medium-range order in glasses. The results indicate that the behaviour of BP in glass can be quantitatively understood in the following two steps. First, the FSDP representing the largest structural correlation in glass is dominantly used to determine the unit size of the elastic modulus heterogeneity, and second, the magnitude of the elastic modulus fluctuation is used to determine the frequency and intensity of the BP.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Serpentine-like Organic Crystal Optical Waveguides for Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical components and circuits that deal with multiple signal generation and processing are quintessential for artificial neural networks. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept four-layered organic optical artificial neural network (ANN)-like architecture, constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN), employing an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip-based mechanical micromanipulation technique. Initially, the strategic selection of four MPyIN crystal active waveguides of varying lengths, mechanically bending them into serpentine-like forms, followed by their hierarchical integration, creates neuron-like, four-layered interconnected optical waveguides with six optical synapses. The synapses in the ANN-like architecture enable parallel transmissions of passive optical signals via evanescent coupling across multiple paths through various layers of the serpentine-shaped optical waveguides. Notably, the feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to multiply and split the optical signal generated at any input into four diverging signals with varying magnitudes. Here, certain outputs deliver a mixed signal (passive and active) due to diverging and converging optical transmission paths. This hierarchical, ANN-like tiny architecture paves the way for the development of smart optical neural networks utilizing multiple emissive and phase-changing organic crystals.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity coexisting with the anomalous Hall effect in 1T'-WS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of quasi-two-dimensional materials that display a high technological potential due to their wide range of electronic ground states, e.g., from superconducting to semiconducting, depending on the chemical composition, crystal structure, or electrostatic doping. Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic pressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting, topological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we observe a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the concomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably, upon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant superconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous Hall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in superconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient pressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing symmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system concomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly different band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the superconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable superconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band features can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the surface paradox: Buried perovskite quantum dots in wide-bandgap perovskite thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions composed of Fe3GaTe2 electrodes and hBN tunneling barrier, observed at room temperature. The polarity reversal of TMR occurs consistently at around 0.625 V across multiple devices and temperatures, highlighting the robustness of the effect. To understand this behavior, we developed a theoretical model incorporating spin-resolved density of states (DOS) at high energy levels. By adjusting the DOS weighting at different k points to account for misalignment between the crystal structure of electrodes in experimental devices, we improved agreement between experimental and theoretical inversion voltages. Our results provide valuable insight into the voltage-controlled spin injection and detection in two-dimensional magnetic tunnel junctions, with implications for the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin polarised quantised transport via one-dimensional nanowire-graphene contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene spintronics offers a promising route to achieve low power 2D electronics for next generation classical and quantum computation. As device length scales are reduced to the limit of the electron mean free path, the transport mechanism crosses over to the ballistic regime. However, ballistic transport has yet to be shown in a graphene spintronic device, a necessary step towards realising ballistic spintronics. Here, we report ballistic injection of spin polarised carriers via one-dimensional contacts between magnetic nanowires and a high mobility graphene channel. The nanowire-graphene interface defines an effective constriction that confines charge carriers over a length scale smaller than that of their mean free path. This is evidenced by the observation of quantised conductance through the contacts with no applied magnetic field and a transition into the quantum Hall regime with increasing field strength. These effects occur in the absence of any constriction in the graphene itself and occur across several devices with transmission probability in the range T = 0.08 - 0.30.</description>

      <title>Autonomous scanning probe microscopy with hypothesis learning: Exploring the physics of domain switching in ferroelectric materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the development and implementation of a hypothesis learning based automated experiment, in which the microscope operating in the autonomous mode identifies the physical laws behind the material's response. Specifically, we explore the bias induced transformations that underpin the functionality of broad classes of devices and functional materials from batteries and memristors to ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. Optimization and design of these materials require probing the mechanisms of these transformations on the nanometer scale as a function of the broad range of control parameters such as applied potential and time, often leading to experimentally intractable scenarios. At the same time, often the behaviors of these systems are understood within potentially competing theoretical models, or hypotheses. Here, we develop a hypothesis list that covers the possible limiting scenarios for the domain growth, including thermodynamic, domain wall pinning, and screening limited. We further develop and experimentally implement the hypothesis driven automated experiment in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, autonomously identifying the mechanisms of the bias induced domain switching. This approach can be applied for a broad range of physical and chemical experiments with relatively low dimensional control parameter space and for which the possible competing models of the system behavior that ideally cover the full range of physical eventualities are known or can be created. These include other scanning probe microscopy modalities such as force distance curve measurements and nanoindentation, as well as materials synthesis and optimization.</description>

      <title>Testing Protocols for Obtaining Reliable PDFs from Laboratory x-ray Sources Using PDFgetX3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored data acquisition protocols and improved data reduction protocols using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable data for atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis from a laboratory-based Mo x-ray source. A variable counting scheme is described that preferentially counts in the high-angle region of the diffraction pattern. The effects on the resulting PDF are studied by varying the overall count time, the use of Soller slits, and limiting the out-of-plane divergence of the incident beam. The protocols are tested using an amorphous silica and a quartz sample. We also present a modification to the current PDFgetX3 data corrections to take care of sample absorption, which was previously neglected in the use of that program for high-energy synchrotron x-ray data. We show that, despite limitations in the Q-range and flux of laboratory instruments, reasonable data for PDF model fits may be obtained using the best protocols in a few hours of counting.</description>

      <title>Magnetic topological Weyl fermions in half-metallic In$_2$CoSe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM) have recently attracted much attention due to their potential in realizing strong anomalous Hall effects. Yet, how to design such systems remains unclear. Based on first-principles calculations, we show here that the ferromagnetic half-metallic compound In$_2$CoSe$_4$ has several pairs of Weyl points and is hence a good candidate for magnetic WSM. These Weyl points would approach the Fermi level gradually as the Hubbard $U$ increases, and finally disappear after a critical value $U_c$. The range of the Hubbard $U$ that can realize the magnetic WSM state can be expanded by pressure, manifesting the practical utility of the present prediction. Moreover, by generating two surface terminations at Co or In atom after cleaving the compound at the Co-Se bonds, the nontrivial Fermi arcs connecting one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality are discovered in surface states. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the nontrivial surface state experimentally, e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. As such, the present findings imply strongly a new magnetic WSM which may host a large anomalous Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.</description>

      <title>Resonant X-ray spectroscopies on Chromium $3\textit{d}$ orbitals in CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr $3\textit{d}$ orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in lattice engineering of lithium niobate single crystal thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) single crystal thin films are a high-performance photonic platform with applications in electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical devices, optical frequency combs, and acousto-optic modulators. LN's significance in photonics parallels silicon's in electronics, addressing challenges like high power consumption and slow communication speeds, and offering potential for broad applications in optical communications, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Despite progress in developing LN-based photonic structures, achieving low-loss, reconfigurable, and large-scale devices requires improved processing techniques. This work introduces a quantum design methodology based on LN's crystal structure, utilizing electron-phonon coupling through external field perturbations. Multiscale structural analysis is performed with techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectra to identify and control defect structures. Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory further reveal the mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling. These findings establish a framework for designing LN-based quantum devices with enhanced performance and diverse functionalities.</description>

      <title>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics at the onset of spin-spin correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique properties and potential applications when reduced to one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs), owing to quantum confinement and high edge densities. However, effective growth methods for self-aligned TMD NRs are still lacking. We demonstrate a versatile approach for lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned MoS2 NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nm and longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction, being also extensible to the growth of WS2 NRs and MoS2-WS2 hetero-nanoribbons. Growth is influenced by both substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction. The 1D nature of the NRs was asserted by the observation of Coulomb blockade at low temperature. Pronounced catalytic activity was observed at the edges of the NRs, indicating their promise for efficient catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and the triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned design principles for enhanced red emission from nitride quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted toward mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as they are viewed as detrimental to light emission, albeit with limited success for red emission. Here, we show that such fields can unusually enhance the optical oscillator strength of red-emitting nitride quantum wells. This insight is enabled by machine-learned models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, allowing for a global exploration of the quantum-well design space at greatly reduced computational cost. Larger polarization fields correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission, a consequence of the quantum-confined Stark effect enabling thinner quantum wells. This finding has implications for designing efficient red nitride LEDs, which are crucial for miniaturizing polychromatic LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. More broadly, this work highlights the power of machine learning in accelerating the discovery of unconventional paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>
