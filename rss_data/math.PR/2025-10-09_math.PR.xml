      <title>Phase transition for recurrence of stationary random walks on lamplighter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of random walks on lamplighter groups $H\wr G$, where $H$ is a nontrivial finitely generated group and $G$ is an infinite finitely generated group, called \textbf{stationary random walks}. At each step, the walk switches the lamp at its current position, moves in the base group with a drift towards the identity, and switches the lamp again at the new position. We show that when $G$ is virtually-$\mathbb{Z}$ and $H$ is finite, these walks exhibit a phase transition between recurrence and transience, while when~$G$ is not virtually-$\mathbb{Z}$ or $H$ is infinite, they are always transient. In the case $G=\mathbb{Z}$, we determine the exact critical parameter and provide a quantitative description of this phase transition.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Discrete Percolation Models to the Brownian Web Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brownian web is a collection of coalescing Brownian motions started from every space-time point in R2. The Brownian web can be constructed as a scaling limit of coalescing one-dimensional simple random walks started at every point in a two-dimensional space-time lattice. Veto and Virag (2023) introduced a family of discrete random distance functions defined on these sequences of rescaled lattices. It was shown that, given the appropriate notion of convergence, these discrete distance functions converge to a function known as the Brownian web distance. We introduce a new method of argument that allows us to show that a broad class of discrete first passage percolation models also converge to the Brownian web distance. Unlike the arguments used in Veto and Virag (2023), our methods do not depend on the use of planar dual graphs. This allows our methods to be applied to models that allow random walks to cross one another before coalescing.</description>

      <title>Conditional McKean-Vlasov control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional McKean-Vlasov control problems involve controlling McKean-Vlasov diffusions where the interaction occurs through the law of the state process conditionally on it staying in a domain. Introduced by Lions in his 2016 lectures at the Coll\`ege de France, these problems have notable applications, particularly in systemic risk. We establish well-posedness and provide a general characterization of optimal controls using a new Pontryagin maximum principle in the probabilistic weak formulation. Unlike the classical approach based on forward-backward systems, our results connect the control problem to a generalized McKean-Vlasov backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). We illustrate our framework with two applications: a version of the Schr\"odinger problem with killing, and a construction of equilibria in potential mean field games via McKean-Vlasov control.</description>

      <title>On Convex Functions of Gaussian Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a convexity properties for normalized log moment generating function continuing a recent investigation of Chen of convex images of Gaussians. We show that any variable satisfying a ``Ehrhard-like'' property for its distribution function has a strictly convex normalized log moment generating function, unless the variable is Gaussian, in which case affine-ness is achieved. Moreover we characterize variables that satisfy the Ehrhard-like property as the convex images of Gaussians. As applications, we derive sharp comparisons between R\'enyi divergences for a Gaussian and a strongly log-concave variable, and characterize the equality case. We also demonstrate essentially optimal concentration bounds for the sequence of conic intrinsic volumes associated to convex cone and we obtain a reversal of McMullen's inequality between the sum of the (Euclidean) intrinsic volumes associated to a convex body and the body's mean width that generalizes and sharpens a result of Alonso-Hernandez-Yepes.</description>

      <title>Local repulsion between zeros and critical points of the Gaussian Entire Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zeros and critical points of different indices of the standard Gaussian entire function on the complex plane (whose zero set is stationary). We provide asymptotics for the second order correlations of all the corresponding number statistics on small observation disks, showing various rates of local repulsion. The results have consequences for signal processing, as they show extremely strong repulsion between the local maxima and zeros of spectrograms of noise computed with respect to Gaussian windows.</description>

      <title>Multivariate CLT for L\'evy processes: convergence rates without moment assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the norm of a $d$-dimensional L\'evy process possesses a finite second moment if and only if the convex distance between an appropriately rescaled process at time $t$ and a standard Gaussian vector is integrable in time with respect to the scale-invariant measure $t^{-1} dt$ on $[1,\infty)$. We further prove that under the standard $\sqrt{t}$-scaling, the corresponding convex distance is integrable if and only if the norm of the L\'evy process has a finite $(2+\log)$-moment. Both equivalences also hold for the integrability with respect to $t^{-1} dt$ of the multivariate Kolmogorov distance. Our results imply: (I) polynomial Berry-Esseen bounds on the rate of convergence in the convex distance in the CLT for L\'evy processes cannot hold without finiteness of $(2+\delta)$-moments for some $\delta&gt;0$ and (II) integrability of the convex distance with respect to $t^{-1} dt$ in the domain of non-normal attraction cannot occur for any scaling function.</description>

      <title>Quantitative boundary H\"{o}lder estimates for the inhomogeneous Poisson problem through a probabilistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive quantitative boundary H\"older estimates, with explicit constants, for the inhomogeneous Poisson problem in a bounded open set $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
  Our approach has two main steps: firstly, we consider an arbitrary $D$ as above and prove that the boundary $\alpha$-H\"older regularity of the solution the Poisson equation is controlled, with explicit constants, by the H\"older seminorm of the boundary data, the $L^ \gamma$-norm of the forcing term with $\gamma&gt;d/2$, and the $\alpha/2$-moment of the exit time from $D$ of the Brownian motion.
  Secondly, we derive explicit estimates for the $\alpha/2$-moment of the exit time in terms of the distance to the boundary, the regularity of the domain $D$, and $\alpha$. Using this approach, we derive explicit estimates for the same problem in domains satisfying exterior ball conditions, respectively exterior cone/wedge conditions, in terms of simple geometric features.
  As a consequence we also obtain explicit constants for pointwise estimates for the Green function and for the gradient of the solution.
  The obtained estimates can be employed to bypass the curse of high dimensions when aiming to approximate the solution of the Poisson problem using neural networks, obtaining polynomial scaling with dimension, which in some cases can be shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Sojourns of Vector-Valued Stationary Gaussian Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a centered, homogeneous R^d-valued Gaussian random field X(t), t in R^k, with covariance matrix function R(s,t) = E[X(s) X(t)^T], we investigate the exact asymptotics of kappa_u(x) = P( theta(u) * integral over [0,T]^k of 1{X(t) &gt; u b} dt &gt; x ), where b = (b1, ..., bd)^T, as u -&gt; infinity, with x &gt;= 0 and T &gt; 0, and theta(u) is a scaling function related to the expansion of R(s,t) around (0,0).
  To approximate kappa_u(x), we extend both Berman's original approach and the uniform double-sum method to the multivariate setting. Furthermore, we derive the exact asymptotics for the supremum of X, thus extending several recent results in the literature.</description>

      <title>New representations of the Hu-Meyer formulas and series expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with respect to components of a multidimensional Wiener process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the systematic derivation of new representations of the Hu-Meyer formulas. The formula expressing a multiple Wiener stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Stratonovich stochastic integrals and the formula expressing a multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Wiener stochastic integrals are derived for the case of a multidimensional Wiener process. The proof method proposed by the author in 2006 is applied. At that a different definition of the multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral and other sufficient conditions for the validity of the Hu-Meyer formulas (compared to known analogues) are used. Of great importance for the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations is the verification of sufficient conditions for the applicability of the Hu-Meyer formula for the case of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with respect to components of a multidimensional Wiener process. In the author's previous works, the indicated conditions were verified for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 (the case of an arbitrary basis in the Hilbert space) and for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 7 and 8 (the case of two special bases in Hilbert space (the trigonometric Fourier basis and the basis of Legendre polynomials)). Therefore, the results of the article will be usefull for constructing high-order strong numerical methods for non-commutative systems of Ito stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Permutations in competing growth processes and balls-in-bins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a model of $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$-valued processes, with random, independent waiting times between jumps. It is known that there is either an emergent `leader', in which a single process possesses the maximal value for all sufficiently large times, or every pair of processes alternates leadership infinitely often. We show that in the latter regime, almost surely, one sees every possible permutation of rankings of processes infinitely often. In the case that the waiting times are exponentially distributed, this proves a conjecture from Spencer (appearing in a paper from Oliveira) on the `balls-in-bins' process with feedback [Conjecture 1, Combin. Probab. Comput. 17(1):87-110, (2008)].</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing of the critical Ising model on sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic Ising model on sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs $G(n,d/n)$ with $d&gt;1$ at the critical temperature $\beta_c=\tanh^{-1}(d^{-1})$ and prove that with high probability, the mixing time is at most polynomial in $n$. Our approach combines the recent stochastic localization framework of Chen and Eldan, which yields spectral gap bounds in the well-behaved bulk of the graph, together with classical results on the relaxation time of Glauber dynamics on trees to handle regions where we cannot apply the Chen-Eldan method directly because of atypically large local neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Retrieving the structure of probabilistic sequences from EEG data during the goalkeeper game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work draws on the conjecture that fingerprints of stochastic event sequences can be retrieved from electroencephalographic data (EEG) recorded during a behavioral task. To test this, we used the Goalkeeper Game (game.numec.prp.usp.br). Acting as a goalkeeper, the participant predicted each kick in a probabilistic sequence while EEG activity was recorded. At each trial, driven by a context tree, the kicker chose one of three options: left, center, or right. The goalkeeper then predicted the next kick by pressing a button. Tree estimation was performed by applying the Context Algorithm to EEG segments locked to the button press (-300 to 0 ms). We calculated the distance between the penalty taker's tree and the trees retrieved per participant and electrode. This metric was then correlated with the goalkeeper's success rates. We observed a clear reduction in the overall distance distribution over time for a subset of electrodes, indicating that EEG dependencies become more congruent with the penalty taker's tree as the goalkeeper learns the sequence. This distance is inversely proportional to the goalkeepers' success rates, indicating a clear relationship between performance and the neural signatures associated with the sequence structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in dynamic causal inference introduced a class of discrete-time stochastic processes that generalize martingale difference sequences and arrays as follows: the random variates in each sequence have expectation zero given certain lagged filtrations but not given the natural filtration. We formalize this class of stochastic processes and prove a stable central limit theorem (CLT) via a Bernstein blocking scheme and an application of the classical martingale CLT. We generalize our limit theorem to vector-valued processes via the Cram\'er-Wold device and develop a simple form for the limiting variance. We demonstrate the application of these results to a problem in dynamic causal inference and present a simulation study supporting their validity.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Nonlinearity: Trainable Gaussian Mixture Modules for Modern Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength, these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range of machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Equivalence for Self-Attention: Asymptotic Spectral Analysis of Attention Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention layers have become fundamental building blocks of modern deep neural networks, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly from the perspective of random matrix theory. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention matrix and establish the first Gaussian equivalence result for attention. In a natural regime where the inverse temperature remains of constant order, we show that the singular value distribution of the attention matrix is asymptotically characterized by a tractable linear model. We further demonstrate that the distribution of squared singular values deviates from the Marchenko-Pastur law, which has been believed in previous work. Our proof relies on two key ingredients: precise control of fluctuations in the normalization term and a refined linearization that leverages favorable Taylor expansions of the exponential. This analysis also identifies a threshold for linearization and elucidates why attention, despite not being an entrywise operation, admits a rigorous Gaussian equivalence in this regime.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling for Functions under Generalized Growth Conditions and Its Applications in Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems can be formulated as high-dimensional integrals of discontinuous functions that often exhibit significant growth, challenging the error analysis of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods. This paper studies RQMC methods for functions with generalized exponential growth conditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main contribution of this work is threefold. First, by combining RQMC and importance sampling (IS) techniques, we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands with the critical growth condition $e^{A\|\boldsymbol{x}\|^2}$ where $A = 1/2$. This theory extends existing results in the literature, which are limited to the case $A &lt; 1/2$, and we demonstrate that by imposing a light-tail condition on the proposal distribution in the IS, the RQMC method can maintain its high-efficiency convergence rate even in this critical growth scenario. Second, we verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling (ODIS) satisfy the required light-tail condition, providing rigorous theoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for discontinuous integrands from finance, we combine the preintegration technique with RQMC-IS. We prove that this integrand after preintegration preserves the exponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated discontinuous functions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS convergence framework. Finally, numerical results validate our theory, showing that the proposed method is effective in handling these problems with discontinuous payoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesic slice sampling, introduced in Durmus et al., 2024, is a slice sampling based Markov chain Monte Carlo method for approximate sampling from distributions on Riemannian manifolds. We prove that it is uniformly ergodic for distributions with compact support that have a bounded density with respect to the Riemannian measure. The constants in our convergence bound are available explicitly, and we investigate their dependence on the hyperparameters of the geodesic slice sampler, the target distribution and the underlying domain.</description>

Abstract: We study quasisymmetric maps on two variants of the classical fractal percolation model: the fat and dense fractal percolations. We show that, almost surely conditioned on non-extinction, the Hausdorff dimension of the fat fractal percolation cannot be lowered with a quasisymmetry and the Hausdorff dimension of the dense fractal percolation cannot be lowered with a power quasisymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the spectral behavior of large dimensional Chatterjee's rank correlation matrix when observations are independent draws from a high-dimensional random vector with independent continuous components. We show that the empirical spectral distribution of its symmetrized version converges to the semicircle law, and thus providing the first example of a large correlation matrix deviating from the Marchenko-Pastur law that governs those of Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman. We further establish central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics, which in turn enable the development of Chatterjee's rank correlation-based tests of complete independence among the components.</description>

      <title>On quantum to classical comparison for Davies generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting.
  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of multiple radial SLE(0) -- a smooth system of curves in a simply connected domain $\Omega$ with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$ -- arising as the deterministic limit of random multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  We construct multiple radial SLE(0) systems by starting from the stationary relations, which arise heuristically as the $\kappa \to 0$ limit of partition functions. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n\}$.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  In the deterministic case $\kappa = 0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero--Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

Abstract: The Chinese restaurant process is a basic sequential construction of consistent random partitions. We consider random point measures describing the composition of small blocks in such partitions and show that their scaling limit is given by the projective limit of certain inhomogeneous Poisson measures on cones of increasing dimension. This result makes it possible to derive classical and functional limit theorems in the Skorokhod topology for various characteristics of the Chinese restaurant process.</description>

      <title>Condensation in subcritical Cauchy Bienaym\'e trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to study the geometry of large size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees whose offspring distribution is subcritical, belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha=1$ and satisfies a local regularity assumption. We show that a condensation phenomenon occurs: one unique vertex of macroscopic degree emerges, and its height converges in distribution to a geometric random variable. Furthermore, the height of such trees grows logarithmically in their size. Interestingly, the behavior of subcritical Bienaym\'ee trees with $\alpha=1$ is quite similar to the case $\alpha \in( 1,2]$, in contrast with the critical case. This completes the study of the height of heavy-tailed size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees.
  Our approach is to check that a random-walk one-big-jump principle due to Armend\'ariz &amp; Loulakis holds, by using local estimates due to Berger, combined with the previous approach to study subcritical Bienaym\'e trees with $\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Sutherland system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$.
  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative.
  When $\Omega$ is taken to be the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$.
  Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns.
  For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero--Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

Abstract: In 2020, F. Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the convex order between the distributions of linear functionals does not imply the convex order between the probability distributions over $\mathbb R^d$ if $d\ge2$. This stands in contrast with the well-known fact that any probability distribution in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge1$, is determined by the corresponding distributions of linear functionals. By duality, it follows that, for any $d\ge2$, not all convex functions from $\mathbb R^d$ to $\mathbb R$ can be represented as the limits of sums $\sum_{i=1}^k g_i\circ \ell_i$ of convex functions $g_i$ of linear functionals $\ell_i$ on $\mathbb R^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>
