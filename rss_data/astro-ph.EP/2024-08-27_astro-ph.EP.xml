      <title>Two Novel Hot Jupiter Formation Pathways: How White Dwarf Kicks Shape the Hot Jupiter Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Hot Jupiters (HJs) is disputed between a variety of in situ and ex situ formation scenarios. One of the early proposed ex situ scenarios was the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism combined with tidal circularization, which can produce HJs with the aid of a stellar or planetary companion. However, observations have revealed a lack of stellar companions to HJs, which challenges the importance of the binary star-driven EKL plus tides scenario. In this work, we explore so far unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects on HJ formation, in particular the effect of white dwarf (WD) formation. Gaia observations have revealed that WDs often undergo a kick during formation, which can alter a binary's orbital configuration or even unbind it. Based on this WD kick, in this letter we propose and explore two novel HJ formation pathways: 1) HJs that are presently orbiting single stars, but were initially formed in a binary that was later unbound by a WD kick; 2) Binaries that survive the WD kick can trigger enhanced EKL oscillations and lead to 2nd generation HJ formation. We demonstrate that the majority of seemingly single HJs could have formed in binary star systems. As such, HJ formation in binaries via the EKL mechanism could be one of the dominant HJ formation pathways, and our results highlight that unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects, like WD formation, can obscure the actual origin of observed exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m Phase Curve of Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although exoplanetary science was not initially projected to be a substantial part of the Spitzer mission, its exoplanet observations set the stage for current and future surveys with JWST and Ariel. We present a comprehensive reduction and analysis of Spitzer's 4.5 micron phase curves of 29 hot Jupiters on low-eccentricity orbits. The analysis, performed with the Spitzer Phase Curve Analysis (SPCA) pipeline, confirms that BLISS mapping is the best detrending scheme for most, but not all, observations. Visual inspection remains necessary to ensure consistency across detrending methods due to the diversity of phase curve data and systematics. Regardless of the model selection scheme - whether using the lowest-BIC or a uniform detrending approach - we observe the same trends, or lack thereof. We explore phase curve trends as a function of irradiation temperature, orbital period, planetary radius, mass, and stellar effective temperature. We discuss the trends that are robustly detected and provide potential explanations for those that are not observed. While it is almost tautological that planets receiving greater instellation are hotter, we are still far from confirming dynamical theories of heat transport in hot Jupiter atmospheres due to the sample's diversity. Even among planets with similar temperatures, other factors like rotation and metallicity vary significantly. Larger, curated sample sizes and higher-fidelity phase curve measurements from JWST and Ariel are needed to firmly establish the parameters governing day-night heat transport on synchronously rotating planets.</description>

      <title>JWST Thermal Emission of the Terrestrial Exoplanet GJ 1132b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present thermal emission measurements of GJ 1132b spanning 5--12 um obtained with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/LRS) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). GJ 1132b is an M-dwarf rocky planet with Teq=584 K and an orbital period of 1.6 days. We measure a white-light secondary eclipse depth of 140+/-17 ppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of Tp,dayside= 709+/-31 K using improved star and planet parameters. This measured temperature is only 1 sigma below the maximum possible dayside temperature of a bare rock (i.e., assuming a zero albedo planet with no heat redistribution, Tmax = 746+14/-11 K). The emission spectrum is consistent with a featureless blackbody, which agrees with a wide range of possible surface compositions. By comparing forward models to the dayside emission spectrum, we rule out Earth-thickness (P ~ 1 bar) atmospheres with at least 1% H2O, atmospheres of any modeled thickness (10^-4 -- 10^2 bar) that contain at least 1% CO2, and thick, Venus-like atmospheres (P&gt;~100 bar) with at least 1 ppm CO2 or H2O. We therefore conclude that GJ 1132b likely does not have a significant atmosphere. This finding supports the concept of a universal 'Cosmic Shoreline' given the high level of bolometric and XUV irradiation received by the planet.</description>

      <title>Buto Facula, Ganymede: Palimpsest Exemplar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowhere in the solar system are impact morphologies observed in greater variety than on the icy Galilean satellites. This is likely a consequence of the structural and thermal state of the crust at the time of impact, and perhaps impact velocity. Palimpsest-type impact features show smooth enclosed central plains surrounded by undulating plains, within which are distributed concentric arcuate ridges, and no recognizable rim. Buto Facula on Ganymede is the best resolved of any palimpsest, having mostly been imaged at 190 m/pixel and optimum lighting, allowing insight into the circumstances that form this type of impact feature. Part of an impact crater on the eastern edge of Buto Facula has been buried by undulating plains material, suggesting that at the time of their emplacement the undulating plains behaved as a low-viscosity flow advancing across the landscape around the impact zone, encroaching on landforms that it encountered. We evaluated hypotheses for the formation of undulating plains using impact and ejecta modeling. We do not attribute the source of Buto's undulating plains to "dry" impact ejecta due to the existence of impact features larger than Buto that are not surrounded by undulating plains deposits. We performed iSALE impact simulations incorporating a subsurface liquid layer (or low strength layer) at various depths. An impact into a surface with a pre-existing, 5 km-deep, 5 km-thick fluid layer results in excavation of fluid material from that layer, producing a nearly flat final surface profile that is consistent with Buto's flat profile and the distribution of its undulating plains material. A liquid layer at a depth of 20-40 km results in impact feature profiles that resemble classic impact craters. We offer tests of this shallow subsurface liquid layer hypothesis for palimpsest formation that could potentially be performed by JUICE and Europa Clipper.</description>

      <title>Four HD 209458 b transits through CRIRES+: Detection of H$_2$O and non-detections of C$_2$H$_2$, CH$_4$, and HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 209458 b is one of the most studied exoplanets to date. Despite this, atmospheric characterisation studies yielded inconsistent species detections and abundances. Values reported for the C/O ratio range from 0.1 to 1.0. Of particular interest is the simultaneous detection of H2O and HCN reported by some studies using high-resolution ground-based observations, which would require the atmospheric C/O ratio to be fine-tuned to a narrow interval around 1. HCN has however not been detected from recent space-based observations.
  We aim to provide an independent study of HD 209458 b's atmosphere with high-resolution observations, in order to infer the presence of several species, including H2O and HCN.
  We observed four primary transits of HD 209458 b at a high resolution (R=92000) with CRIRES+ in the near infrared (band H, 1.4--1.8 um). After reducing the data with pycrires, we prepared the data using the SysRem algorithm and performed a cross-correlation (CCF) analysis of the transmission spectra. We also compared the results with those obtained from simulated datasets constructed by combining the Exo-REM self-consistent model with the petitRADTRANS package.
  Combining the four transits, we detect H2O with a signal-to-noise CCF metric of 8.7. This corresponds to a signal emitted at $K_p=151.3^{+31.1}_{-23.4}$ km/s and blueshifted by $-6^{+1}_{-2}$ km/s, consistent with what is expected for HD 209458 b. We do not detect any other species among C2H2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2S, HCN, and NH3. Comparing this with our simulated datasets, this result is consistent with a C/O ratio of 0.1 and an opaque cloud top pressure of 50 Pa, at a 3 times solar metallicity. This would also be consistent with recent JWST observations. However, none of the simulated results obtained with a bulk C/O ratio of 0.8, a value suggested by previous studies using GIANO-B and CRIRES, are consistent with our observations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m Eclipse Depths for the Inflated Hot Jupiter in the Evolved Binary System HD 202772</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an inflated Hot Jupiter orbiting an early-type primary star in the evolved binary HD 202772 system, HD 202772 A b's presence invites a study of how such a planet forms and evolves. As a prelude to potential atmospheric characterization with the latest generation of observatories, we present a reduction and analysis of eclipse light curve observations of HD 202772 A b acquired with the Spitzer Space Telescope using the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m channels. We find eclipse depths of $680\pm68$ and $1081^{+54}_{-53}$ ppm, respectively, corresponding to day-side effective temperatures of $2130^{+102}_{-91}$ and $2611^{+46}_{-49}$ K. The corresponding Bond albedos are consistent with the distribution of albedos for Hot Jupiters observed with both Spitzer and TESS. The heat redistribution efficiencies consistent with the Bond albedo range predicted by 1-D atmospheric models in radiative-convective equilibrium are $0.71\pm0.10$ and $0.03^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, respectively, indicating a weak day-night contrast for the former and a strong contrast for the latter. Given this, and the unique environment in which this planet resides, we recommend follow-up observations with JWST to more precisely constrain its atmospheric composition and structure, as well as its host stellar environment, to elucidate if and how the atmospheres of these close-in giants evolve with host stars in binaries past the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Spectro-photometry of Phobos simulants: II. Effects of porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface porosity has been found to be an important property for small bodies. Some asteroids and comets can exhibit an extremely high surface porosity in the first millimeter layer. This layer may be produced by various processes and maintained by the lack of an atmosphere. However, the influence of porosity on the spectro-photometric properties of small body surfaces is not yet fully understood. In this study, we looked into the effect of porosity on the spectro-photometric properties of Phobos regolith spectroscopic simulants; created by mixing the simulants with ultra-pure water, producing ice-dust particles, and then sublimating the water. The reflectance spectroscopic properties in the visible and near-infrared (0.5-4.2 $\mu$m) show no strong variations between the porous and compact samples. However, one simulant exhibits a bluing of the slope after increasing porosity, providing possible insights into the differences between the blue and red units observed on Phobos. In the mid-infrared range, a contrast increase of the 10-$\mu$m emissivity plateau due to silicates is observed. Photometry reveals a modification in the phase reddening behavior between the compact powder and the sublimation residue for both simulants. However, the observed behavior is different between the simulants, suggesting that the phase reddening may be dependent on the composition of the simulants. The phase curve also appears to be modified by the addition of porosity, with a higher contribution of forward scattering observed for the sublimation residue. The derivation of the Hapke parameters indicates an increase in roughness for the porous sample, but no significant modification of the opposition effect. This study aims to provide new insights into the understanding of porosity by using two Phobos simulants in the context of the upcoming JAXA/Martian Moons eXploration mission.</description>

      <title>Simulating Gravitational Microlensing Events by TESS: Predictions on Statistics and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics and properties of microlensing events that can be detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate potential microlensing events from a sample of the TESS Candidate Target List(CTL) stars by assuming different observational time spans(or different numbers of sectors for each star) and a wide range of lens masses, i.e., $M_{\rm l}\in [0.1M_{\oplus},~2 M_{\odot}]$. On average, the microlensing optical depth and the event rate for CTL stars are $\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq0.6\times10^{-9}$ per star per day, respectively. The microlensing optical depth decreases by increasing the CTL priority, whereas the efficiency for detecting their microlensing signals enhances with the priority. Additionally, we simulate the microlensing events from the TESS Full-Frame Images(FFIs) stars extracted from the \texttt{TESS}-\texttt{SPOC} pipeline. The optical depth and event rate for these stars are on average $\simeq 1$-$3\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq 1$-$4\times 10^{-9}$ per star per day, and their highest values occur for sector $12$. The total number of microlensing events for the CTL stars is $N_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\sim0.03$, whereas for the FFIs' stars number of events per star during $27.4$-day observing windows is $\hat{N}_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\simeq1.4 \times 10^{-6}$. Based on four criteria we extract the detectable microlensing events and evaluate the detection efficiencies. The highest efficiency for detecting microlensing events from the TESS data occurs for the lens mass $\log_{10}[M_{\rm l}(M_{\odot})] \in [-4.5$,~$-2.5]$, i.e., super-Earth to Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets(FFPs). The detectable microlensing events from the TESS stars are significantly affected by both finite-source and parallax effects.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Searching for Close-in Companions around Young M Dwarfs using a Multi-year PSF Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Super-RDI, a unique framework for the application of reference star differential imaging (RDI) to Keck/NIRC2 high-contrast imaging observations with the vortex coronagraph. Super-RDI combines frame selection and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optimization techniques with a large multi-year reference point spread function (PSF) library to achieve optimal PSF subtraction at small angular separations. We compile a $\sim$7000 frame reference PSF library based on a set of 288 new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ sequences of 237 unique targets acquired between 2015 and 2019 as part of two planet-search programs, one focusing on nearby young M dwarfs and the other targeting members of the Taurus star-forming region. For our dataset, synthetic companion injection-recovery tests reveal that frame selection with the mean-squared error (MSE) metric combined with KLIP-based PSF subtraction using 1000-3000 frames and $&lt;$500 principal components yields the highest average S/N for injected synthetic companions. We uniformly reduce targets in the young M-star survey with both Super-RDI and angular differential imaging (ADI). For the typical parallactic angle rotation of our dataset ($\sim$10$^\circ$), Super-RDI performs better than a widely used implementation of ADI at separations $\lesssim$0.4" ($\approx$5 $\lambda$/$D$) gaining an average of 0.25 mag in contrast at 0.25" and 0.4 mag in contrast at 0.15". This represents a performance improvement in separation space over RDI with single-night reference star observations ($\sim$100 frame PSF libraries) applied to a similar Keck/NIRC2 dataset in previous work. We recover two known brown dwarf companions and provide detection limits for 155 targets in the young M-star survey. Our results demonstrate that increasing the PSF library size with careful selection of reference frames can improve the performance of RDI with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in $L'$.</description>

      <title>SO as shock tracer in protoplanetary disks: the AB Aurigae case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Sulfur Monoxide is known to be a good shock tracer in molecular clouds and protostar environments, but its abundance is difficult to reproduce even using state-of-the-art astrochemical models. }
  {We investigate the properties of the observed SO emission in the protoplanetary disk of AB Auriga, a Herbig Ae star of 2.4 $\Msun$ located at 156 pc. The AB Aur system is unique because it exhibits a dust trap and at least one young putative planet orbiting at about 30 au from the central star.}
  {We reduced ALMA archival data (projects 2019.1.00579.S, 2021.1.00690.S and 2021.1.01216.S) and analyzed the three detected SO lines (SO $6_5-5_4$, $6_7-5_6$ and $5_6-4_5$).
  We also present C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O 2-1 data to complement the interpretation of the SO data.}
  {For the three SO lines, the maximum SO emission in the ring is not located in the dust trap. Moreover, the inner radius of the SO ring is significantly larger than the CO emission inner radius, $\sim 160$ au versus $\sim 90$ au. The SO emission traces gas located in part beyond the dust ring. This emission likely originates from shocks at the interface of the outer spirals, observed in CO and scattered light emission, and the molecular and dust ring. SO is also detected inside the cavity, at a radius $\sim 20-30$ au and with a rotation velocity compatible with the proto-planet P1. We speculate that this SO emission originates from accretion shocks onto the circumplanetary disk of the putative proto-planet P1.}
  {These observations confirm that SO is a good tracer of shocks in protoplanetary disks and could be a powerful, new tool to detect embedded (proto-)planets.} Conclusions. These observations confirm that SO is a good tracer of shocks in protoplanetary disks and could be a powerful, new tool to detect embedded (proto-)planets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of Sun-as-a-star observations by the NEID Solar Telescope at WIYN Observatory, spanning January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024. We identify 117,060 observations which are unlikely to be significantly affected by weather, hardware or major calibration issues. We describe several high-level data products being made available to the community to aid in the interpretation and inter comparisons of NEID solar observations. Solar observations demonstrate excellent performance of NEID, including radial velocity (RV) accuracy and long-term stability of better than $\simeq 0.37$ m s$^{-1}$ over $\simeq 3.5$ years, even though NEID was not originally designed or optimized for daytime observations of the Sun. Currently, intrinsic stellar variability is the primary barrier to detecting Earth-analog planets for most nearby, Sun-like stars. We present a comparison of the effectiveness of several methods proposed to mitigate the effects of solar variability on the Sun's estimated RV. We find that the Scalpels algorithm performs particularly well and substantially reduces the RMS RV of solar spectra from over 2 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.277 m s$^{-1}$. Even when training on a subset of days with NEID solar observations and testing on a held-out sample, the RMS of cleaned RV is 0.34-0.42 m s$^{-1}$. This is significantly better than previous attempts at removing solar variability and suggests that the current generation of EPRV instruments are technically capable of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting a solar twin if provided with sufficient observing time allocations ($\sim 10^3$ nights of observations).</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Borde-Traub focal plane wavefront estimation technique for exoplanet direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets relies on complex wavefront sensing and control architectures. In addition to fast adaptive optics systems, most of the future high-contrast imaging instruments will soon be equipped with focal plane wavefront sensing algorithms. These techniques use the science detector to estimate the static and quasi-static aberrations induced by optical manufacturing defects and system thermal variations. Pair-wise probing (PWP) has been the most widely used, especially for space-based application and will be tested at contrast levels of ~1e-9 on-sky along with the future coronagraph instrument onboarding the Roman Space Telescope. This algorithm leans on phase diversities applied on the deformable mirror that are recorded in pairs. A minimum of two pairs of probes are required per bandwidth. An additional unprobed image is also recorded to verify the convergence rate of the correction. Before PWP, Borde &amp; Traub proposed a similar algorithm that takes advantage of the unprobed image in the estimation process to get rid of the pair diversity requirement. In this work, we theoretically show that this latter technique should be more efficient than PWP when the convergence time is not limited by photon noise. We then present its performance and practical limitations on coronagraphic testbeds at JPL and exhibit a first on-sky control of non-common path aberrations with such method on VLT/SPHERE.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>

      <title>The Detection of KIC 1718360, A Rotating Variable with a Possible Companion, Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the detection of a periodic dimming event in the lightcurve of the G1.5IV-V type star KIC 1718360. This is based on visible-light observations conducted by both the TESS and Kepler space telescopes. Analysis of the data seems to point toward a high rotation rate in the star, with a rotational period of 2.938 days. The high variability seen within the star's lightcurve points toward classification as a rotating variable. The initial observation was made in Kepler Quarter 16 data using the One-Class SVM machine learning method. Subsequent observations by the TESS space telescope corroborated these findings. It appears that KIC 1718360 is a nearby rotating variable that appears in little to no major catalogs as such. A secondary, additional periodic dip is also present, indicating a possible exoplanetary companion.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>

      <title>Convective mixing in giant planets and the connection to atmospheric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses ($0.3-2~M_\mathrm{J}$), initial entropies ($8-11~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages $\lesssim 10^7$ years) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: for low primordial entropies of $8-9~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$ convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.</description>

      <title>Phase equilibria of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>
