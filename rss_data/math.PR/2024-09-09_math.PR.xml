      <title>Hardness of sampling for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a hardness of sampling result for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large constant $d$, proving that when the normalized inverse temperature satisfies $\beta&gt;1$ (asymptotically corresponding to the condensation threshold), then w.h.p. over the random graph there is no stable sampling algorithm that can output a sample close in $W_2$ distance to the Gibbs measure. The results also apply to a fixed-magnetization version of the model, showing that there are no stable sampling algorithms for low but positive temperature max and min bisection distributions. These results show a gap in the tractability of search and sampling problems: while there are efficient algorithms to find near optimizers, stable sampling algorithms cannot access the Gibbs distribution concentrated on such solutions.
  Our techniques involve extensions of the interpolation technique relating behavior of the mean field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to behavior of Ising models on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large $d$. While previous interpolation arguments compared the free energies of the two models, our argument compares the average energies and average overlaps in the two models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the Kac stochastic particle system converges to the weak solution of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard potentials and hard spheres. We give, under the initial data with finite exponential moment assumption, an explicit rate of propagation of chaos in squared Wasserstein distance with quadratic cost by using a double coupling technique.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Representation for Viscosity Solutions to Double-Obstacle Quasi-Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) with both upper and lower obstacles. In contrast to most previous works, we allow all involved coefficients to depend on the state variable and do not assume any type of monotonicity. It is well known that double obstacle QVIs are related to zero-sum games of impulse control, and our existence result is derived by considering a sequence of such games. Full generality is obtained by allowing one player in the game to randomize their control. A by-product of our result is that the corresponding zero-sum game has a value, which is a direct consequence of viscosity comparison.
  Utilizing recent results for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we find that the unique viscosity solution to our QVI is related to optimal stopping of BSDEs with constrained jumps and, in particular, to the corresponding non-linear Snell envelope. This gives a new probabilistic representation for double obstacle QVIs. It should be noted that we consider the min-max version (or equivalently the max-min version); however, the conditions under which solutions to the min-max and max-min versions coincide remain unknown and is a topic left for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Volterra Gaussian process of the form $X(t)=\int^t_0K(t,s)d{W(s)},$ where $W$ is a Wiener process and $K$ is a continuous kernel. In dimension one, we prove a law of the iterated logarithm, discuss the existence of local times and verify a continuous dependence between the local time and the kernel that generates the process. Furthermore, we prove the existence of the Rosen renormalized self-intersection local times for a planar Gaussian Volterra process.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel introduced by Leditzky et al. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured stability property, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels.</description>

      <title>Levy driven stochastic heat equation with logarithmic nonlinearity: Well-posedness and Large deviation principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the well-posedness theory for solutions of the stochastic heat equations with logarithmic nonlinearity perturbed by multiplicative Levy noise. By using Aldous tightness criteria and Jakubowski version of the Skorokhod theorem on non-metric spaces along with the standard L2 method, we establish the existence of a path-wise unique strong solution. Moreover, by using a weak convergence method, we establish a large deviation principle for the strong solution of the underlying problem. Due to the lack of linear growth and locally Lipschitzness of the nonlinear term present in the underlying problem, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the nonlinear versions of Gronwall inequalities play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>A policy iteration algorithm for non-Markovian control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new policy iteration algorithm to compute the value function and the optimal controls of continuous time stochastic control problems. The algorithm relies on successive approximations using linear-quadratic control problems which can all be solved explicitly, and only require to solve recursively linear PDEs in the Markovian case. Though our procedure fails in general to produce a non-decreasing sequence like the standard algorithm, it can be made arbitrarily close to being monotone. More importantly, we recover the standard exponential speed of convergence for both the value and the controls, through purely probabilistic arguments which are significantly simpler than in the classical case. Our proof also accommodates non-Markovian dynamics as well as volatility control, allowing us to obtain the first convergence results in the latter case for a state process in multi-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Improved Catoni-Type Confidence Sequences for Estimating the Mean When the Variance Is Infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04198v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete time stochastic model with infinite variance and study the mean estimation problem as in Wang and Ramdas (2023). We refine the Catoni-type confidence sequence (abbr. CS) and use an idea of Bhatt et al. (2022) to achieve notable improvements of some currently existing results for such model.
  Specifically, for given $\alpha \in (0, 1]$, we assume that there is a known upper bound $\nu_{\alpha} &gt; 0$ for the $(1 + \alpha)$-th central moment of the population distribution that the sample follows. Our findings replicate and `optimize' results in the above references for $\alpha = 1$ (i.e., in models with finite variance) and enhance the results for $\alpha &lt; 1$. Furthermore, by employing the stitching method, we derive an upper bound on the width of the CS as $\mathcal{O} \left(((\log \log t)/t)^{\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}}\right)$ for the shrinking rate as $t$ increases, and $\mathcal{O}(\left(\log (1/\delta)\right)^{\frac{\alpha }{1+\alpha}})$ for the growth rate as $\delta$ decreases. These bounds are improving upon the bounds found in Wang and Ramdas (2023). Our theoretical results are illustrated by results from a series of simulation experiments. Comparing the performance of our improved $\alpha$-Catoni-type CS with the bound in the above cited paper indicates that our CS achieves tighter width.</description>

      <title>Cumulants in rectangular finite free probability and beta-deformed singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the $(q,\gamma)$-cumulants, introduced by Xu [arXiv:2303.13812] to study $\beta$-deformed singular values of random matrices, we define the $(n,d)$-rectangular cumulants for polynomials of degree $d$ and prove several moment-cumulant formulas by elementary algebraic manipulations; the proof naturally leads to quantum analogues of the formulas. We further show that the $(n,d)$-rectangular cumulants linearize the $(n,d)$-rectangular convolution from Finite Free Probability and that they converge to the $q$-rectangular free cumulants from Free Probability in the regime where $d\to\infty$, $1+n/d\to q\in[1,\infty)$. As an application, we employ our formulas to study limits of symmetric empirical root distributions of sequences of polynomials with nonnegative roots. One of our results is akin to a theorem of Kabluchko [arXiv:2203.05533] and shows that applying the operator $\exp(-\frac{s^2}{n}x^{-n}D_xx^{n+1}D_x)$, where $s&gt;0$, asymptotically amounts to taking the rectangular free convolution with the rectangular Gaussian distribution of variance $qs^2/(q-1)$.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic random graphs with vertex removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a Dynamic Random Graph with Vertex Removal (DRGVR) defined as follows. At every step, with probability $p &gt; 1/2$ a new vertex is introduced, and with probability $1-p$ a vertex, chosen uniformly at random among the present ones (if any), is removed from the graph together with all edges adjacent to it. In the former case, the new vertex connects by an edge to every other vertex with probability inversely proportional to the number of vertices already present.
  We prove that the DRGVR converges to a local limit and determine this limit. Moreover, we analyse its component structure and distinguish a subcritical and a supercritical regime with respect to the existence of a giant component. As a byproduct of this analysis, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the critical parameter. Furthermore, we provide precise expression of the maximum degree (as well as in- and out-degree for a natural orientation of the DRGVR). Several concentration and stability results complete the study.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree: Heights and Related Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf binary tree, leaf-sets are recursively split into subsets, and a set of $m$ leaves is split into subsets containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities proportional to $1/{i(m-i)}$. We study the continuous-time model in which the holding time before that split is exponential with rate $h_{m-1}$, the harmonic number. We (sharply) evaluate the first two moments of the time-height $D_n$ and of the edge-height $L_n$ of a uniform random leaf (that is, the length of the path from the root to the leaf), and prove the corresponding CLTs. We find the limiting value of the correlation between the heights of two random leaves of the same tree realization, and analyze the expected number of splits necessary for a set of $t$ leaves to partially or completely break away from each other. We give tail bounds for the time-height and the edge-height of the {\em tree}, that is the maximal leaf heights. We show that there is a limit distribution for the size of a uniform random subtree, and derive the asymptotics of the mean size. Our proofs are based on asymptotic analysis of the attendant (sum-type) recurrences. The essential idea is to replace such a recursive equality by a pair of recursive inequalities for which matching asymptotic solutions can be found, allowing one to bound, both ways, the elusive explicit solution of the recursive equality. This reliance on recursive inequalities necessitates usage of Laplace transforms rather than Fourier characteristic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{X_{i}, i\in J\}$ be a family of locally dependent non-negative integer-valued random variables with finite expectations and variances. We consider the sum $W=\sum_{i\in J}X_i$ and use Stein's method to establish general upper error bounds for the total variation distance $d_{TV}(W, M)$, where $M$ represents a three-parameter random variable. As a direct consequence, we obtain a discretized normal approximation for $W$. As applications, we study in detail four well-known examples, which are counting vertices of all edges point inward, birthday problem, counting monochromatic edges in uniformly colored graphs, and triangles in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph. Through delicate analysis and computations, we obtain sharper upper error bounds than existing results.</description>

      <title>Sharper dimension-free bounds on the Frobenius distance between sample covariance and its expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study properties of a sample covariance estimate $\widehat \Sigma$ given a finite sample of $n$ i.i.d. centered random elements in $\R^d$ with the covariance matrix $\Sigma$. We derive dimension-free bounds on the squared Frobenius norm of $(\widehat\Sigma - \Sigma)$ under reasonable assumptions. For instance, we show that $\smash{\|\widehat\Sigma - \Sigma\|_{\rm F}^2}$ differs from its expectation by at most $\smash{\mathcal O({\rm{Tr}}(\Sigma^2) / n)}$ with overwhelming probability, which is a significant improvement over the existing results. This allows us to establish the concentration phenomenon for the squared Frobenius distance between the covariance and its empirical counterpart in the case of moderately large effective rank of $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Approach to Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of Markov processes associated to stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by the kinetics of the law of mass action. Their transition rates exhibit a polynomial dependence on the state variable, with possible discontinuities of the dynamics along the boundary of the state space. We investigate the scaling properties of these networks when the norm of the initial state is converging to infinity and the reaction rates are fixed. This scaling approach is used to have insight on the time evolution of these networks when they start from a ``large'' initial state. The main difference with the scalings of the literature is that it does not change neither the graph structure of the CRN, nor its reaction rates. Several simple and interesting examples of CRNs are investigated with this scaling approach, including the detailed analysis of a CRN with several unsual asymptotic properties in the last section. We also show that a stability criterion due to Filonov for positive recurrence of Markov processes may simplify significantly the stability analysis of these networks.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the original version of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) presented in Ho, J., Jain, A., and Abbeel, P., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Noise for $f$-Differential Privacy via Anti-Concentration and Stochastic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish anti-concentration inequalities for additive noise mechanisms which achieve $f$-differential privacy ($f$-DP), a notion of privacy phrased in terms of a tradeoff function $f$ which limits the ability of an adversary to determine which individuals were in the database. We show that canonical noise distributions (CNDs), proposed by Awan and Vadhan (2023), match the anti-concentration bounds at half-integer values, indicating that their tail behavior is near-optimal. We also show that all CNDs are sub-exponential, regardless of the $f$-DP guarantee. In the case of log-concave CNDs, we show that they are the stochastically smallest noise compared to any other noise distributions with the same privacy guarantee. In terms of integer-valued noise, we propose a new notion of discrete CND and prove that a discrete CND always exists, can be constructed by rounding a continuous CND, and that the discrete CND is unique when designed for a statistic with sensitivity 1. We further show that the discrete CND at sensitivity 1 is stochastically smallest compared to other integer-valued noises. Our theoretical results shed light on the different types of privacy guarantees possible in the $f$-DP framework and can be incorporated in more complex mechanisms to optimize performance.</description>

      <title>Towards An Analytical Framework for Dynamic Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential game is an emerging notion and framework for studying N-player games, especially with heterogeneous players. In this paper, we build an analytical framework for dynamic potential games. We prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if and only if each player's value function can be decomposed as a potential function and a residual term which is solely dependent on other players' policies. This decomposition is consistent with the result in the static setting and enables us to identify and analyze an important and new class of dynamic potential games called the distributed game. Moreover, we prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if the value function has a symmetric Jacobian. This generalizes the differential characterization for static potential games by replacing the classical derivative with a new notation of functional derivative with respect to Markov policies. For a general class of continuous-time stochastic games, we explicitly characterize their potential functions. In particular, we show that the potential function of linear-quadratic games can be studied through a system of linear ODEs. Furthermore, under a rank condition on control coefficients, we prove a linear-quadratic game is a Markov potential game if and only if all players have identical cost functions.</description>

      <title>An extension of Krishnan's central limit theorem to the Brown-Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a central limit theorem, recently established for the Thompson group $F=F_2$ by Krishnan, to the Brown-Thompson groups $F_p$, where $p$ is any integer greater than or equal to $2$. The non-commutative probability space considered is the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[F_p]$, equipped with the canonical trace. The random variables in question are $a_n:= (x_n + x_n^{-1})/\sqrt{2}$, where $\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}$ represents the standard family of infinite generators. Analogously to the case of $F=F_2$, it is established that the limit distribution of $s_n = (a_0 + \ldots + a_{n-1})/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the standard normal distribution.
  Furthermore, it is demonstrated that for a state corresponding to Jones's oriented subgroup $\vec{F}$, such a central limit theorem does not hold.</description>
