      <title>Quantum dot energy levels in bilayer graphene: Exact and approximate study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schr\"odinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic spin transport in ultrathin black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anisotropic crystals, the direction-dependent effective mass of carriers can have a profound impact on spin transport dynamics. The puckered crystal structure of black phosphorus (BP) leads to direction-dependent charge transport and optical response, suggesting that it is an ideal system for studying anisotropic spin transport. To this end, we fabricate and characterize high mobility encapsulated ultrathin BP-based spin-valves in four-terminal geometry. Our measurements show that in-plane spin-lifetimes are strongly gate tunable and exceed one nanosecond. Through high out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe a five-fold enhancement in the out-of-plane spin signal case compared to in-plane and estimate a colossal spin lifetime anisotropy of ~ 6. This finding is further confirmed by Oblique Hanle measurements. Additionally, we estimate an in-plane spin-lifetime anisotropy ratio of up to 1.8. Our observation of strongly anisotropic spin transport along three orthogonal axes in this pristine material could be exploited to realize directionally tunable spin transport.</description>

      <title>Staggered nonlinear spin generations in centrosymmetric altermagnets under electric current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin generations are of significant importance for electrically controllable magnetization. Due to symmetry constraints, linear spin generation is absent in centrosymmetric magnets and nonlinear contributions become crucial. However, nonlinear spin generations have few examples in centrosymmetric compensated magnets with opposite-spin sublattices, which hinders electric control of associated magnetization. Here, we study nonlinear spin generations in altermagnets with opposite-spin sublattices. In a square altermagnetic model, both staggered and uniform nonlinear spin generations appear at opposite-spin sublattices. They vary as the magnetization direction rotates, with emerging out-of-plane components that can be utilized in perpendicular magnetization switching of high-density storage devices. By first-principles calculations, out-of-plane, staggered nonlinear spin generations are found to be considerable in a typical altermagnet, Fe$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer. Our findings provide opportunities for electrically manipulating magnetization and designing energy-efficient magnetic devices based on compensated magnets.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Bulk Current in Quantum Hall Systems with an Expanding Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding topological phases of matter is essential for advancing both the fundamental theory and practical applications of condensed matter physics. Recently, a theoretical framework for a quantum Hall system with an expanding edge state was proposed [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}, 105009 (2022)], revealing the existence of an energy flux analogous to Hawking radiation on the edge. Motivated by this work, we extend the analysis to a model of a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime that includes both the bulk and edge regions. Due to the presence of bulk and edges, we demonstrate that the covariant form of the gravitational anomaly appears on the edge via the anomaly-inflow mechanism. Then, we investigate the energy flux on the edge from the viewpoint of gravitational anomalies, such as covariant gravitational and Weyl anomalies. We also find that, due to the conservation of energy and momentum in the entire system, the presence of anomalous currents on the expanding edge induces non-trivial currents in the bulk originating from the expansion of the edge.</description>

      <title>Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon spectra and vibrational heat capacity of quasi-one-dimensional structures formed by rare gas atoms on the surface of carbon nanotube bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The features of phonon spectra and their effect on the vibrational heat capacity of linear chains of inert gas atoms adsorbed onto a substrate, which is the surface of nanotubes bound to a nanobundle. The influence of the substrate results both in a shift of the lower limit of the chain spectrum from zero, and in mechanical stress in the chain (its extension or compression) also. It is shown that in the case of a compressed chain, the non-central interaction between atoms is negative (repulsive), it results in a shift of the lower boundary of the spectrum of transverse vibrations to low frequencies and to a shortening of the part of the specific heat temperature dependence in which this dependence is close to exponential. Heterogeneity of the nanobundle structure can cause a change in the distances between atoms of the chain. It is shown both and analytically and numerically, that as a result of it, discrete levels with frequencies both above and below the quasi-continuous spectrum band can appear in the phonon spectrum of the chain. The discrete levels with frequencies below the quasi-continuous spectrum band lead to a further shortening of the temperature interval at which the temperature dependence of the specific heat is close to the exponential one.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Tunable In-Plane Ge/Si(001) Nanowires Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium nanostructures offer significant potential in developing advanced integrated circuit and disruptive quantum technologies, yet achieving both scalability and high carrier mobility remains a challenge in materials science. Here, we report an original low-temperature epitaxial method for growth of site-controlled in-plane germanium nanowires with high hole mobility by molecular beam epitaxy. By reducing the growth temperature, we effectively suppress Si-Ge interdiffusion, ensuring pure germanium composition within the nanowires while preserving their high crystalline quality. The method employs pre-patterned ridges on strain-relaxed Si$_{0.75}$Ge$_{0.25}$/Si(001) substrates as tailored templates, enabling control over the position, length, spacing and cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. Electrical measurements of field-effect devices made from as-grown germanium nanowires show that the nanowires are of hole conduction with mobility exceeding 7000 cm$^{2}$/Vs at 2-20 K. The method paves a way for fabrication of scalable germanium nanowire networks, providing a reliable platform for the developments of high-performance nanoelectronics and multi-qubit chips.</description>

      <title>Quantized and nonquantized Hall response in topological Hatsugai-Kohmoto systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the robustness of Hall conductivity quantization in several insulating systems, exhibiting one scenario where the quantization is not preserved. Specifically, we apply the Kubo formula to topological models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Starting from the many-body degeneracy induced by this interaction in the topological Kane-Mele model, we consider Zeeman fields to select specific states within the ground-state manifold that reveal a non-quantized Hall response, precisely for the case with a Zeeman field diagonal in the bands of the Kane-Mele model. From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.</description>

      <title>A direct dispersive signature of Pauli spin blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) is a key paradigm in semiconductor nanostructures and gives access to the spin physics. We report the direct observation of PSB with gate-dispersive reflectometry on double quantum dots with source-drain bias. The reservoir charge transitions are strongly modulated, turning on and off when entering and leaving the blockaded region, consistent with a simple model. Seen with holes in Ge and Si, the effects are enhanced with larger bias voltage and suppressed by magnetic field. This work lays the foundation for fast probing of spin physics and minimally invasive spin readout.</description>

      <title>High-temperature helical edge states in BiSbTeSe$_2$/graphene van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have been used to tailor atomic layers into various artificial materials through interactions at heterointerfaces. The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${\'e}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality. It offers various applications including spin-current conversion and platforms for Majorana fermions in junctions to superconductors.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic structure of oxidized magnetite nanoparticles: sharp structural versus diffuse magnetic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation of magnetite to maghemite is a naturally occurring process that leads to the degradation of the magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles. Despite being systematically observed with traditional macroscopic magnetization measurement techniques, a detailed understanding of this process at the microscale is still missing. In this study, we track the evolution of the magnetic structure of magnetite nanoparticles during their oxidation to maghemite through numerical micromagnetic simulations. To capture realistic interparticle effects, we incorporate dipolar interactions by modeling the nanoparticles arranged in chains. Our computational results are benchmarked against experimental data from magnetotactic bacteria, studied over a time scale of years. To resolve the magnetization at the interface between both oxide phases, we propose spin-polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), an experimental technique capable of probing magnetization textures at nanometer length scales. By analyzing the pair-distance distribution function extracted from SANS, we identify distinct signatures of magnetic disorder. Specifically, our findings suggest that the magnetization from the non-oxidized core region varies smoothly across the (structurally sharp) interface into the oxidized shell. The existence of such a diffuse magnetic interface may account for the superior magnetic properties of partially oxidized magnetite nanoparticles compared to fully converted maghemite samples.</description>

      <title>Realization of pure gyration in an on-chip superconducting microwave device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic materials that emulate tight-binding Hamiltonians have enabled a wide range of advances in topological and non-Hermitian physics. A crucial requirement in such systems is the engineering of non-reciprocal couplings and synthetic magnetic fields. More broadly, the development of these capabilities in a manner compatible with quantum-coherent degrees of freedom remains an outstanding challenge, particularly for superconducting circuits, which are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that pure gyration -- a non-reciprocal coupling with exactly matched magnitude but non-reciprocal $\pi$ phase contrast -- can be realized between degenerate states using only spatio-temporal modulation. Our experiments are performed using microwave superconducting resonators that are modulated using dc-SQUID arrays. We first show the existence of continuous exceptional surfaces in modulation parameter space where coupling with arbitrarily-large magnitude contrast can be achieved, with robust volumes of $\pi$ phase contrast contained within. We then demonstrate that intersection of these volumes necessarily gives rise to new continuous surfaces in parameter space where pure gyration is achieved. With this we experimentally demonstrate $&gt;58$ dB isolation and the first on-chip gyrator with only superconducting circuit elements. Our method is fully agnostic to physical implementation (classical or quantum) or frequency range and paves the way to large-scale non-reciprocal metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dissolved, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in a temperature-dependent process. We show herein that such incomplete dissociation yields an enormous thermoelectric response in an electrolyte-filled nanochannel along which a temperature gradient is applied. For this purpose, an extended version of the Nernst-Planck equations is developed that takes into account the temperature-dependent dissociation-association equilibrium. The results indicate that in this way, Seebeck coefficients can be achieved that outperform all previously reported values.</description>

      <title>Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

Abstract: MXenes and MBenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides and borides, have been extensively studied for their impressive properties. Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Tripartite Entanglement Generation via Correlated Noise in Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Visualizing intercalation effects in 2D materials using AFM based techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of two dimensional materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides, is a noninvasive way to modify electronic, optical and structural properties of these materials. However, research of these atomic-scale phenomena usually relies on using Ultra High Vacuum techniques which is time consuming, expensive and spatially limited. Here we utilize Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based techniques to visualize local structural and electronic changes of the MoS2 on graphene on Ir(111), caused by sulfur intercalation. AFM topography reveals structural changes, while phase imaging and mechanical measurements show reduced Young's modulus and adhesion. Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy highlights variations in surface potential and work function, aligning with intercalation signatures, while Photoinduced Force Microscopy detects enhanced optical response in intercalated regions. These results demonstrate the efficacy of AFM based techniques in mapping intercalation, offering insights into tailoring 2D materials electronic and optical properties. This work underscores the potential of AFM techniques for advanced material characterization and the development of 2D material applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Hot Spots in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Devices by Scanning Thermal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, resistive heating due to domain wall conduction still remains unexplored. Here, we employ scanning thermal microscopy to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of up to ~ 20 K, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from filament-based models. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation for nanoelectromechanical systems beyond the wide-band limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling the vibrations of an oscillator to electronic transport is a key building block for nanoelectromechanical systems. They describe many nanoscale electrical components such as molecular junctions. Inspired by recent experimental developments, we derive a quantum master equation that describes nanoelectromechanical systems in a generally overlooked situation: when the electronic transport is slower than the natural frequency of the oscillator. Here, a semi-classical model is no longer valid and we develop the missing fully quantum approach. Moreover, we go beyond the wide-band limit and study the consequence of maintaining energy dependent tunneling rates, which are required to describe effects found in real devices. To benchmark our results, we compare with numerically exact results obtained with the hierarchical equations of motion method, and find overall good agreements in the experimentally accessible steady state regime. Furthermore, we derive from the microscopic model a ready to use particle current expression that replicates features already observed experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We extend Kitaev's real-space formulation of the first Chern number to the second Chern number and establish a computational framework for its evaluation. To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.</description>

      <title>Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings along different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening new avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have been rare in literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in such a system via two different coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their microscopic origin. In case of the local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast between the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytic approach involving a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons. The formalism renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes, yielding magnon-polaron quasiparticles. In both the coupling regimes, validations for the topological signatures are systematically derived from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we investigate transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity that aids in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing the transition to strong coupling regime for an ensemble of emitters resonantly coupled to a localized surface plasmon in a metal-dielectric structure. The response of a hybrid system to an external field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective states of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. First is the near-field coupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode which underpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling regime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between the plasmon dipole moment and plasmon-induced dipole moment of bright collective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The latter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a system with characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual emitters comprising the collective state are driven by same alternating plasmon near field and therefore all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads to scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude with the ensemble size and therefore it strongly affects the shape of scattering spectra for large ensembles. Specifically, with increasing emitters numbers, the Fano interference leads to a spectral weight shift towards the lower energy polaritonic band.</description>

      <title>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence in moire heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, noncommuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights into the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for noncommuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Design and benchmarks for emulating Kondo dynamics on a quantum chip</title>

Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes at MHz frequencies. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5x10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for direct coupling to qubits or in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits or low-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Exciton--Hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridized States in hBN-encapsulated Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>
