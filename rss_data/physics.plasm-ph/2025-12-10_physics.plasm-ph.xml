      <title>The effects of H blistering and ELMs on the thermal fatigue cracking of W by strikepoint sweeping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic thermal loads imposed on a W divertor by strikepoint sweeping may induce low-cycle thermal fatigue cracking of its plasma-facing surfaces. This cracking may be accelerated by plasma-material interactions such as H implantation, blistering, fuzz and void formation. Fatigue cracking may also synergise with ELM cracking. To explore these novel forms of environmentally assisted fatigue, FEA modelling was used to design a uniaxial fatigue experiment for Magnum-PSI that represents strikepoint sweeping at 1 Hz across a 100 mm span of a divertor target. Magnum-PSI was used to combine cyclic thermal loading of W with H implantation and two forms of ELM like pre-cracking. Quantitative SEM analysis of fatigue-cracked W revealed that H implantation significantly delayed crack initiation, with preimplanted targets requiring 450-600 cycles before failure compared to 150 cycles for non-implanted samples. This was attributed to hydrogen-induced dislocation pinning, which produces a case-hardening effect that inhibits persistent slip band formation. ELM-like pre-cracking combined with strikepoint sweeping was found to give rise to localised melting and the formation of 30 micromete diameter droplets, caused by thermal isolation of W regions by fatigue cracks. The implications for the fatigue lifetime of tokamak divertors are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Alfv\'en waves in the temperature anisotropic space plasma with a kappa-Maxwellian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves are studied in temperature anisotropic space plasma with kappa-Maxwellian distribution. Employing a kinetic approach, the wave frequency and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the modified ion acoustic waves are derived in a low \b{eta} plasma, which both depend on the parameters \k{appa} and . The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency of kinetic Alfv\'en waves is larger in kappa-Maxwellian plasma than that in Maxwellian case. The wave frequency of the modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is larger in the short-wave region but smaller in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. Again, we found that the damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger than that in Maxwellian case. The damping rate of modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger in the short-wave region but weaker in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. The impact of the parameter on the two modes is relatively small because we consider the low \b{eta} case. These results are helpful for us to understand better the characteristics of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in space plasma.</description>

      <title>Firehose instability in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electron firehose mode propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons. The dispersion relation, the wave frequency and the growth rate of electron firehose mode are derived, and the condition for onset of the firehose instability is obtained. We show that the wave frequency and the growth rate both depend significantly on the parameters, such as the parallel electron beta , the nonthermal parameter {\Lambda} and the electron temperature anisotropy Ae , and the anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons change the instability condition. The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency and the growth rate of the electron firehose mode increase with increase of the parameters. The results may be helpful for understanding the firehose instability in space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Ion-acoustic shock and solitary waves in magnetized plasma with Cairns-Gurevich distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation properties of ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves in the magnetized viscous plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons are investigated. The Cairns-Gurevich distribution as the electron distribution is considered to describe the plasma nonthermality and particle trapping. By adopting the reductive perturbation technique, we derived the nonlinear Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (SKdVB) equation, and then obtained the ion-acoustic shock and solitary wave solutions of the SKdVB equation for different limiting cases. It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter {\alpha}, external magnetic field {\Omega}, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity {\eta}0 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves. These results may be useful for better understanding the propagation of nonlinear structures in space (i.e. Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, auroral regions) and laboratory plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional reduced plasma model for the electrical treeing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma models, consisting of advection-diffusion Partial Differential Equations coupled with chemical reactions, are widely adopted to describe corona, streamers and dielectric barrier discharges. However, the complex geometry of the electrical treeing represents an obstacle for numerical simulations. We develop a reduced one-dimensional formulation of a plasma model for the electrical treeing, describing the evolution of charge concentrations under the effect of an electric field. The reduced system consists of weakly coupled advection-diffusion-reaction equations for charge concentrations inside the treeing and on the dielectric surface, coupled with production-destruction Ordinary Differential Equations for the dipole moment. A numerical scheme based on Finite Volumes and Patankar-type methods allows efficient simulations, while preserving key physical properties. The model is tested on increasingly complex geometries, from a straight line to a realistic electrical treeing.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for "Helios," a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric ("QA") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting ("HTS") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.</description>

      <title>Ion-beam driven dust-cyclotron and dust-lower-hybrid instabilities in nonthermal dusty magnetoplasmas with dust-charge fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a new dispersive dust-lower-hybrid (DLH)-like mode that can couple to modified dust-cyclotron (DC) waves in a dusty magnetoplasma by the influence of a streaming ion beam. Previous studies have overlooked such hybrid modes and the coupling in the study of resonant cyclotron instabilities in dusty magnetoplasmas. Using two-fluid models for positive ion beams and charged dust grains, nonthermal $\kappa$-density distributions for electrons and positive ions, and orbital motion limited (OML) models for dust-charge fluctuations, we derive a general linear dispersion relation for the coupled DLH and DC modes in the limit of when the hydrodynamic time scale is much longer than the dust-charging time scale. The hybrid mode propagates with a frequency lower than the typical dust-lower-hybrid frequency, $\widetilde{\omega}_{\rm{dl}}\equiv\omega_{\rm{pd}}\Omega_d/\sqrt{\omega^2_{\rm{pd}}+\Omega^2_d}$, where $\omega_{\rm{pd}}$ is the dust-plasma oscillation frequency and $\Omega_d$ is the dust-cyclotron frequency. We obtain the growth rates of instabilities due to Cerenkov and cyclotron interactions and analyze them, taking into account the influences of the static magnetic field, ion-to-electron temperature ratio, electron-to-dust number density ratio, dust-charge fluctuation, and superthermal electrons and ions. We find that the maximum growth rates tend to increase but reach steady states as the wave number increases. The instabilities reported here could be relevant to various plasma environments, including space plasmas (e.g., Earth's magnetosphere) and laboratory dusty plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Photon Phase-Space Dynamics in a Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency up-shifting of laser light in a beam-driven plasma wakefield has the potential to provide high-intensity sources of short wavelength radiation. Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake- phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation.</description>

      <title>Plasma waveguides for high-intensity laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental to many applications of laser pulses in science and technology is an extended interaction length with matter that significantly exceeds the distance over which the pulse would normally diffract and transversely spread. At low intensity, the interaction could simply be the linear refraction provided by a glass optical fiber to keep the pulse from spreading. At increased pulse intensity, more than diffraction-free pulse transport is of interest: an extended interaction length of high intensity light can give rise to bright secondary sources of photons, and at relativistic intensities, beams of high energy charged particles. As generation of these secondary sources requires laser intensities well above the threshold for ionization of atoms, new methods for defeating pulse diffraction in a plasma have been developed. Chief among them are plasma waveguides: optical fibers composed of plasma that have characteristic mode structure. This article reviews the methods and theory of plasma waveguides, highlighting the recent development of meter-scale plasma waveguides that have been instrumental to the laser acceleration of high charge electron beams to ~10 GeV.</description>

      <title>CIEMAT-QI4X: a reactor-relevant quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration compatible with an island divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-field-period quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration is presented that exhibits small neoclassical and electrostatic turbulent transport, good fast-ion confinement over a wide range of $\beta$ values, small bootstrap current and an edge island structure compatible with an island divertor. This configuration, called CIEMAT-QI4X, has been obtained by building on the optimization strategy and sophisticating the methods employed in [S\'anchez E. et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 066037]. The optimization has been improved by incorporating metrics to control Mercier stability and by enforcing strict constraints on the rotational transform profile to achieve nested toroidal surfaces in the confinement region and a divertor island structure at the plasma edge. Specifically, CIEMAT-QI4X has a 4/4 island chain at the edge that is resilient at least up to $\beta=4\%$, even when the bootstrap current is included. A corresponding set of filamentary coils is presented that generates the configuration with enough accuracy to preserve the aforementioned physics properties. In terms of physics performance, CIEMAT-QI4X establishes as a candidate for a stellarator fusion reactor design.</description>
