      <title>The Quantumly Fast and the Classically Forrious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extremal Forrelation problem, where, provided with oracle access to Boolean functions $f$ and $g$ promised to satisfy either $\textrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ or $\textrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$, one must determine (with high probability) which of the two cases holds while performing as few oracle queries as possible. It is well known that this problem can be solved with \emph{one} quantum query; yet, Girish and Servedio (TQC 2025) recently showed this problem requires $\widetilde\Omega(2^{n/4})$ classical queries, and conjectured that the optimal lower bound is $\widetilde\Omega(2^{n/2})$. Through a completely different construction, we improve on their result and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{0.4999n})$, which matches the conjectured lower bound up to an arbitrarily small constant in the exponent.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Independent Set and More when Excluding a Half-Graph, Co-Matching, or Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Ding, Oporowski, Oxley, and Vertigan implies that any sufficiently large twin-free graph contains a large matching, a co-matching, or a half-graph as a semi-induced subgraph. The sizes of these unavoidable patterns are measured by the matching index, co-matching index, and half-graph index of a graph. Consequently, graph classes can be organized into the eight classes determined by which of the three indices are bounded.
  We completely classify the parameterized complexity of Independent Set, Clique, and Dominating Set across all eight of these classes. For this purpose, we first derive multiple tractability and hardness results from the existing literature, and then proceed to fill the identified gaps. Among our novel results, we show that Independent Set is fixed-parameter tractable on every graph class where the half-graph and co-matching indices are simultaneously bounded. Conversely, we construct a graph class with bounded half-graph index (but unbounded co-matching index), for which the problem is W[1]-hard.
  For the W[1]-hard cases of our classification, we review the state of approximation algorithms. Here, we contribute an approximation algorithm for Independent Set on classes of bounded half-graph index.</description>

      <title>Determining the Outerthickness of Graphs Is NP-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short, self-contained, and easily verifiable proof that determining the outerthickness of a general graph is NP-hard. This resolves a long-standing open problem on the computational complexity of outerthickness.
  Moreover, our hardness result applies to a more general covering problem $P_F$, defined as follows. Fix a proper graph class $F$ whose membership is decidable. Given an undirected simple graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the task is to cover the edge set $E(G)$ by at most $k$ subsets $E_1,\ldots,E_k$ such that each subgraph $(V(G),E_i)$ belongs to $F$. Note that if $F$ is monotone (in particular, when $F$ is the class of all outerplanar graphs), any such cover can be converted into an edge partition by deleting overlaps; hence, in this case, covering and partitioning are equivalent.
  Our result shows that for every proper graph class $F$ whose membership is decidable and that satisfies all of the following conditions: (a) $F$ is closed under topological minors, (b) $F$ is closed under $1$-sums, and (c) $F$ contains a cycle of length $3$, the problem $P_F$ is NP-hard for every fixed integer $k\ge 3$. In particular:
  For $F$ equal to the class of all outerplanar graphs, our result settles the long-standing open problem on the complexity of determining outerthickness.
  For $F$ equal to the class of all planar graphs, our result complements Mansfield's NP-hardness result for the thickness, which applies only to the case $k=2$.
  It is also worth noting that each of the three conditions above is necessary. If $F$ is the class of all eulerian graphs, then cond. (a) fails. If $F$ is the class of all pseudoforests, then cond. (b) fails. If $F$ is the class of all forests, then cond. (c) fails. For each of these three classes $F$, the problem $P_F$ is solvable in polynomial time for every fixed integer $k\ge 3$, showing that none of the three conditions can be dropped.</description>

      <title>Expansive homeomorphisms on complexity quasi-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity quasi-metric, introduced by Schellekens, provides a topological framework where the asymmetric nature of computational comparisons -- stating that one algorithm is faster than another carries different information than stating the second is slower than the first -- finds precise mathematical expression. In this paper we develop a comprehensive theory of expansive homeomorphisms on complexity quasi-metric spaces. Our central result establishes that the scaling transformation $\psi_\alpha(f)(n)=\alpha f(n)$ is expansive on the complexity space $(\C,d_\C)$ if and only if $\alpha\neq 1$. The $\delta$-stable sets arising from this dynamics correspond exactly to asymptotic complexity classes, providing a dynamical characterisation of fundamental objects in complexity theory. We prove that the canonical coordinates associated with $\psi_\alpha$ are hyperbolic with contraction rate $\lambda=1/\alpha$ and establish a precise connection between orbit separation in the dynamical system and the classical time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns. We further investigate unstable sets, conjugate dynamics, and topological entropy estimates for the scaling map. Throughout, concrete algorithms and Python implementations accompany the proofs, making every result computationally reproducible. SageMath verification snippets are inlined alongside the examples, and the full code is available in the companion repository.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of Multipacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multipacking in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set $M\subseteq V$ such that for every vertex $v\in V$ and for every integer $r\geq 1$, the ball of radius $r$ around $v$ contains at most $r$ vertices of $M$, that is, there are at most $r$ vertices in $M$ at a distance at most $r$ from $v$ in $G$. The Multipacking problem asks whether a graph contains a multipacking of size at least $k$. For more than a decade, it remained an open question whether the Multipacking problem is NP-complete or solvable in polynomial time. Whereas the problem is known to be polynomial-time solvable for certain graph classes (e.g., strongly chordal graphs, grids, etc). Foucaud, Gras, Perez, and Sikora [Algorithmica 2021] made a step towards solving the open question by showing that the Multipacking problem is NP-complete for directed graphs and it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the solution size. In this paper, we prove that the Multipacking problem is NP-complete for undirected graphs, which answers the open question. Moreover, the problem is W[2]-hard for undirected graphs when parameterized by the solution size. Furthermore, we have shown that the problem is NP-complete and W[2]-hard (when parameterized by the solution size) even for various subclasses: chordal, bipartite, and claw-free graphs. Whereas, it is NP-complete for regular, and CONV graphs (intersection graphs of convex sets in the plane). Additionally, the problem is NP-complete and W[2]-hard (when parameterized by the solution size) for chordal $\cap$ $\frac{1}{2}$-hyperbolic graphs, which is a superclass of strongly chordal graphs where the problem is polynomial-time solvable. On the positive side, we present an exact exponential-time algorithm for the Multipacking problem on $n$-vertex general graphs, which breaks the $2^n$ barrier by achieving a running time of $O^*(1.58^n)$.</description>

      <title>VERIFY-RL: Verifiable Recursive Decomposition for Reinforcement Learning in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training language models to solve complex mathematical problems benefits from curriculum learning progressively training on simpler subproblems. However, existing decomposition methods are often heuristic, offering no guarantees that subproblems are simpler, that solving them aids the parent task, or that their relationships are mathematically grounded. We observe that symbolic differentiation provides a natural structure for verified decomposition: calculus rules explicitly define how expressions reduce to simpler components with provable properties. We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving "verification by construction" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall.</description>

      <title>Space Complexity Dichotomies for Subgraph Finding Problems in the Streaming Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space complexity of four variants of the standard subgraph finding problem in the streaming model. Specifically, given an $n$-vertex input graph and a fixed-size pattern graph, we consider two settings: undirected simple graphs, denoted by $G$ and $H$, and oriented graphs, denoted by $\vec{G}$ and $\vec{H}$. Depending on the setting, the task is to decide whether $G$ contains $H$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph, or whether $\vec{G}$ contains $\vec{H}$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph. Let Sub$(H)$, IndSub$(H)$, Sub$(\vec{H})$, and IndSub$(\vec{H})$ denote these four variants, respectively.
  An oriented graph is well-oriented if it admits a bipartition in which every arc is oriented from one part to the other, and a vertex is non-well-oriented if both its in-degree and out-degree are non-zero. For each variant, we obtain a complete dichotomy theorem, briefly summarized as follows.
  (1) Sub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H$ is bipartite.
  (2) IndSub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H \in \{P_3, P_4, co\mbox{-}P_3\}$.
  (3) Sub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by a single-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if every connected component of $\vec H$ is either a well-oriented bipartite graph or a tree containing at most one non-well-oriented vertex.
  (4) IndSub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if the underlying undirected simple graph $H$ is a $co\mbox{-}P_3$.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by optimization oracles in bandits with network interference, we study the Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling (NAGL) problem. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\sum_{v \in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\!\left(n\cdot \mathrm{tw}(G^2)\cdot L^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\right)$ time. For approximation, unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is no polynomial-time $n^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation on general graphs even under the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$; without the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$, no finite multiplicative approximation ratio is possible. In the nonnegative-reward regime, we give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NAGL in two settings: (i) given a proper $q$-coloring of $G^2$, we obtain a $1/q$-approximation; and (ii) on planar graphs of bounded maximum degree, we develop a Baker-type polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which becomes an efficient PTAS (EPTAS) when $L$ is constant.</description>

      <title>Plethysm is in #BQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.
  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</description>

      <title>Debate is efficient with your time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI safety via debate uses two competing models to help a human judge verify complex computational tasks. Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.
  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) &lt;= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>The Ideal Membership Problem and Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given polynomials $f_0,\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications. For instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
  Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] advanced these results to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] to systems of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input polynomial has bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Linear Time Seeded Extractors with Short Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time $\Omega(n \log(1/\varepsilon))$ and often slower, where $n$ is the input source length and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require $\varepsilon$ to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical.
  Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time $O(n \log^c n)$, for any error $\varepsilon$. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for $n$-bit sources with any min-entropy $k$ and any target error $\varepsilon$ with seed length $d=O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$ and output length $m=(1-\eta)k$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\eta&gt;0$, running in nearly-linear time. When $k$ or $\varepsilon$ are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan's extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most $\frac{n}{\log(1/\varepsilon)polylog(n)}$. Previous fast implementations of Trevisan's extractor ran in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time in this setting.</description>

      <title>On the Space Complexity of Online Convolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete convolution streaming problem. An input arrives as a stream of numbers $z = (z_0,z_1,z_2,\ldots)$, and at time $t$ our goal is to output $(Tz)_t$ where $T$ is a lower-triangular Toeplitz matrix. We focus on space complexity; we define a model for studying the memory-size of online continuous algorithms. In this model, algorithms store a buffer of $\beta(t)$ numbers in order to achieve their goal.
  We characterize space complexity using the language of generating functions. The matrix $T$ corresponds to a generating function $G(x)$. When $G(x)$ is rational of degree $d$, it is known that the space complexity is at most $O(d)$. We prove a corresponding lower bound; the space complexity is at least $\Omega(d)$. In addition, for irrational $G(x)$, we prove that the space complexity is infinite. We also provide finite-time guarantees. For example, for the generating function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ that was studied in various previous works in the context of differentially private continual counting, we prove a sharp lower bound on the space complexity; at time $t$, it is at least $\Omega(t)$.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and $p$ robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of $p$. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph $G = (V, E)$, achieving a running time of $\mathcal{O}(p \cdot (|V| + |E|))$ in sparse graphs and $\mathcal{O}(|V| + |E|)$ in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph $G$ that is not universally solvable for $p$ robots, the question is to check if for a given budget $b$, at most $b$ edges can be added to $G$ to make it universally solvable for $p$ robots. We provide an upper bound of $p - 2$ on $b$ for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require $\Theta(p)$ edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where $a$ vertices and $b$ edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on $a$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Elementary Symmetric Polynomials in Positive Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first extend the results of Chatterjee,Kumar,Shi,Volk(Computational Complexity 2022) by showing that the degree $d$ elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables have formula lower bounds of $\Omega(d(n-d))$ over fields of positive characteristic. Then, we show that the results of the universality of linear projections of elementary symmetric polynomials from Shpilka(JCSS 2002) and of border fan-in two $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuits from Kumar(ACM TOCT 2020) over zero characteristic fields do not extend to fields of positive characteristic. In particular, we show that *There are polynomials that cannot be represented as linear projections of the elementary symmetric polynomials(in fact, we show linear lower bounds over the size of the sum of such linear projections) and *There are polynomials that cannot be computed by border depth-$3$ circuits of top fan-in $k$, called $\overline{\Sigma^{[k]}\Pi\Sigma}$, for $k = o(n)$.
  To prove the first result, we consider a geometric property of the elementary symmetric polynomials, namely, the set of all points in which the polynomial and all of its first-order partial derivatives vanish. It was previously shown that the dimension of this space was exactly $d-2$ for fields of zero characteristic. We extend this to fields of positive characteristic by showing that this dimension must be between $d-2$ and $d-1$. In fact, we provide some criterion where it is $d-2$ and others where it is $d-1$.
  Then, to consider the border top fan-in of linear projections of the elementary symmetric polynomials and border depth-$3$ circuits(sometimes called border affine Chow rank), we show that it is sufficient to consider the border top fan-in of the sum of such linear projections of the elementary symmetric polynomials. This is done by an explicit construction of a 'metapolynomial,' meaning that this result also applies in the border setting.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>The Structural Complexity of Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{M}$, and supporting queries that, for any vector $v$, returns the matrix-vector product $\mathbf{M} v$. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas on the other side, theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Hence, we study the problem for \emph{structured} matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ Boolean matrices of VC-dimension $d$, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Furthermore, we show how to extend this result to the non-Boolean setting with the Pollard pseudodimension.
  Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector (OMv) hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query, even over the boolean semi-ring) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for effective resistance, Laplacian solvers, shortest paths, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector multiplication result, we show we can maintain these problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms through graph composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we unify several quantum algorithmic frameworks for boolean functions that are based on the quantum adversary bound. First, we show that the $st$-connectivity framework subsumes the (adaptive/extended) learning graph framework, and the weighted-decision-tree framework. Additionally, we show that every randomized algorithm can be turned into an $st$-connectivity problem as well, with the same complexity up to constants. This situates the $st$-connectivity framework in between randomized and quantum algorithms, indicating that it's an intermediate computational model between classical and quantum. We also introduce a generalization of the $st$-connectivity framework, the \textit{graph composition framework}, and show that it subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer framework, and it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework.
  Second, we investigate these frameworks' power by investigating the most efficient algorithms they can produce, in terms of the number of queries to the input. We show that the weighted-decision-tree framework's power is polynomially related to deterministic query complexity, showing that the quantum speed-ups that can be obtained with this framework are at most quadratic.
  Finally, we turn our attention to time-efficient implementations of the algorithms constructed through the $st$-connectivity and graph composition frameworks. To that end, we convert instances to the two-subspace phase estimation framework, and we show how we can implement these as transducers. This has the added benefit of removing the effective spectral gap lemma from the construction, significantly simplifying the analysis. We showcase the techniques developed in this work to give improved algorithms for various string search problems.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Envy and Maximizing Happiness in Graphical House Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the house allocation problem in a setting where agents are connected by a graph representing friendships. In this model, two agents can only envy each other if they are neighbors (i.e., friends) in the graph. Each agent has a set of preferred (liked) houses and dislikes the rest. An agent $a$ is said to envy a friend $b$ if $a$ is not assigned any house she likes, while $b$ is allocated a house that $a$ likes. This framework is known as graphical house allocation.
  Within this framework, we investigate two central problems. The first problem is to compute a house allocation that minimizes the number of envious agents. Multiple such allocations may exist that achieve the same minimum level of envy. Among all allocations that minimize envy, the second problem aims to find one that maximizes the number of agents who receive one of their preferred houses.
  We present a detailed complexity-theoretic analysis of these problems. In particular, we show that both problems can be solved in polynomial time when each agent prefers at most one house. However, both become NP-hard even when agents are allowed to prefer at most two houses, thereby highlighting the tight boundary between tractability and intractability.
  Additionally, we design exact algorithms for both problems under certain structural conditions on the agent graph, such as when the graph is sparse, has a small balanced separator, or admits a small vertex cover. These algorithms are significantly faster than the naive brute-force approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central open problems to classify the computational complexity of finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems within P is to prove better algorithmic results for CSPs with a Maltsev polymorphism; we do not even know whether these CSPs are in NC. Relatedly, the descriptive complexity of these problems is open as well. An important special case, previously studied by Carbonell from the perspective of uniform polynomial time-algorithms, are CSPs with a conservative Maltsev polymorphism. We show that for every finite structure B with a conservative Maltsev polymorphism, the CSP for B can be solved by a symmetric linear Z2-Datalog program, and in particular is in the complexity class parity-L. Previously, the best known algorithms just showed containment in P. In our proof we develop a structure theory for conservative Maltsev algebras which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Complexity of Matrix Multiplication to $O(N^2log_2N)$ by an Asymptotically Optimal Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental classical computing operation whose efficiency becomes a major challenge at scale, especially for machine learning applications. Quantum computing, with its inherent parallelism and exponential storage capacity, offers a potential solution to these limitations. This work presents a quantum kernel-based matrix multiplication algorithm (QKMM) that achieves an asymptotically optimal computational complexity of $ O(N^2 \log_2 N) $, outperforming the classical optimal complexity of $ O(N^{2.371552}) $, where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension. Through noiseless and noisy quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits superior theoretical efficiency but also shows practical advantages in runtime performance and stability.</description>
