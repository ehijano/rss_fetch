      <title>Endogenous Crashes as Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the mechanisms behind extreme financial events, specifically market crashes, by employing the theoretical framework of phase transitions. We focus on endogenous crashes, driven by internal market dynamics, and model these events as first-order phase transitions critical, stochastic, and dynamic. Through a comparative analysis of early warning signals associated with each type of transition, we demonstrate that dynamic phase transitions (DPT) offer a more accurate representation of market crashes than critical (CPT) or stochastic phase transitions (SPT). Unlike existing models, such as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, which often suffers from overfitting and false positives, our approach grounded in DPT provides a more robust prediction framework. Empirical findings, based on an analysis of S&amp;P 500 stocks from 2019 to 2024, reveal significant trends in volatility and anomalous dimensions before crashes, supporting the superiority of the DPT model. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the predictive signals preceding market crashes and offers a novel perspective on their underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>The McCormick martingale optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martingale optimal transport (MOT) often yields broad price bounds for options, constraining their practical applicability. In this study, we extend MOT by incorporating causality constraints among assets, inspired by the nonanticipativity condition of stochastic processes. However, this introduces a computationally challenging bilinear program. To tackle this issue, we propose McCormick relaxations to ease the bicausal formulation and refer to it as McCormick MOT. The primal attainment and strong duality of McCormick MOT are established under standard assumptions. Empirically, using the lower and upper bounds derived from marginal constraints, the McCormick relaxations reduce the price gap by an average of 1% for stocks with liquid option markets and 4% for those with moderately liquid markets. When tighter bounds on probability masses are applied, the average reduction increases to 12.66%.</description>

      <title>Neural networks can detect model-free static arbitrage strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate both theoretically as well as numerically that neural networks can detect model-free static arbitrage opportunities whenever the market admits some. Due to the use of neural networks, our method can be applied to financial markets with a high number of traded securities and ensures almost immediate execution of the corresponding trading strategies. To demonstrate its tractability, effectiveness, and robustness we provide examples using real financial data. From a technical point of view, we prove that a single neural network can approximately solve a class of convex semi-infinite programs, which is the key result in order to derive our theoretical results that neural networks can detect model-free static arbitrage strategies whenever the financial market admits such opportunities.</description>
