      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Predicting Thermodynamics of Liquid Water from Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics, introduced over two centuries ago, remains foundational to our understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering systems. Its principles are traditionally grounded in the statistical mechanics framework, which explains macroscopic behavior from microscopic states. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that interprets thermodynamic behavior through the lenses of time series analysis, an approach commonly used in other fields, including finance, climate, and signal processing. We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, the most complex, anomalous, and important substance known, over a wide range of its phase diagram. By examining the temporal evolution of the hydrogen bond network (HBN) topology, we demonstrate that the dynamics of microscopic topological motifs populating the HBN encode the system's macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, our approach enables the prediction of thermodynamic properties in regions beyond those directly sampled in our simulations. We achieve this result by leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in temporally resolved data that are often lost through conventional averaging. This work offers new insights into the fundamental behavior of water and network-forming materials more broadly, establishing a new paradigm for understanding material properties beyond the classical confines of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid equilibria of systems containing 2-methoxyphenol or 2-ethoxyphenol and n-alkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid equilibria phase diagrams have been determined for the systems: 2-methoxyphenol + n-decane, or + n-dodecane, or + n-tetradecane or + n-hexadecane and for 2-ethoxyphenol + n-octane, or + n-dodecane, or + n-tetradecane, or + n-hexadecane. The experimental method used is based on the observation, by means of a laser scattering technique, of the turbidity produced on cooling when a second phase appears. All the mixtures studied show an upper critical solution temperature, which increases with the n-alkane size. Dipolar interactions between like molecules become stronger in the sequence: 2-ethoxyphenol &lt; 2-methoxyphenol &lt; phenol. Data available in the literature suggest that this relative variation is also valid for n-alkane mixtures containing other substituted anilines, characterized by having a second polar group. The dependence of the upper critical solution temperature on the molecular structure of the polar aromatic compound involved is shortly discussed in terms of intramolecular and steric effects.</description>

      <title>Complete insensitivity to ab initio data -- A new perspective on modeling collision-induced absorption of noble gas atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate how the accuracy of CIA spectra depends on the quality of the ab initio data used. We evaluate quantitatively the impact of different quantum chemical methods and basis sets on spectral features, finding that even the lowest-level calculations are accurate to approximately 10 % at room temperature, and better at higher temperatures. This study also reveals a previously unreported double-peak structure for the He-Ne complex, which cannot be described by simple but commonly used single-exponential models for the short-range dipole. Our analysis shows that the range of internuclear distances relevant for CIA spectra varies with temperature, with short-range interactions becoming increasingly important at high temperatures. The long-range van der Waals induced dipoles never contribute. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of CIA spectra and emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of short-range interactions for reliable astronomical modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum smell: tunneling mechanisms in olfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism by which odorants are recognized by olfactory receptors remains primarily unresolved. While charge transport is believed to play a significant role, its precise nature is still unclear. Here, we present a novel perspective by exploring the interplay between the intrinsic energy scales of odorant molecules and the gap states that facilitate intermolecular charge transport. We find that odorants act as weak tunneling conductors mainly because of the limited magnitude of electronic coupling. This behavior is further connected to electron-phonon interactions and reorganization energy, suggesting that physically meaningful values for these parameters emerge only in the deep off-resonant tunneling regime. These findings complement the swipe card model of olfaction, in which an odorant needs both the right shape to bind to a receptor and the correct vibrational frequency to trigger signal transduction. Moreover, they reveal that the underlying mechanisms are much more complex than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matchgate Shadows on Trapped Ion Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow to model chemical reaction barriers with the quantum-classical auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) algorithm with quantum tomography using matchgate shadows. The workflow operates within an accelerated quantum supercomputing environment with the IonQ Forte quantum computer and NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Web Services. We present several algorithmic innovations and an efficient GPU-accelerated execution, which achieves a several orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art implementation of QC-AFQMC. We apply the algorithm to simulate the oxidative addition step of the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using 24 qubits of IonQ Forte with 16 qubits used to represent the trial state, plus 8 additional ancilla qubits for error mitigation, resulting in the largest QC-AFQMC with matchgate shadow experiments ever performed on quantum hardware. We achieve a $9\times$ speedup in collecting matchgate circuit measurements, and our distributed-parallel post-processing implementation attains a $656\times$ time-to-solution improvement over the prior state-of-the-art. Chemical reaction barriers for the model reaction evaluated with active-space QC-AFQMC are within the uncertainty interval of $\pm4$ kcal/mol from the reference CCSD(T) result when matchgates are sampled on the ideal simulator and within 10 kcal/mol from reference when measured on QPU. This work marks a step towards practical quantum chemistry simulations on quantum devices while identifying several opportunities for further development.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. Message-passing GNNs model interactions beyond their immediate neighborhood by propagating local information between neighboring particles while remaining effectively local. However, locality precludes modeling long-range effects critical to many real-world systems, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenge of efficiently modeling non-local interactions. This novel architecture generalizes the classical charge equilibration (Qeq) method to a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. Therefore, CELLI extends the capability of GNNs to model long-range interactions while providing high interpretability through explicitly modeled charges. On benchmark systems, CELLI achieves state-of-the-art results for strictly local models. CELLI generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures while providing high computational efficiency and robust predictions.</description>

      <title>Single-Crystal NMR for 17O in Alanine Enantiomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-crystal solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, which enables detailed analysis of the electronic structures of crystalline molecules, offers a unique opportunity to investigate molecular chirality -- an essential feature with broad implications for understanding the origin and function of life. In this study, we employ single-crystal ssNMR spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to examine the electronic structure of 17O nuclei in crystalline forms of alanine enantiomers. Eight magnetically nonequivalent 17O resonances within the unit cell were observed and successfully assigned, and their corresponding NMR tensor parameters were determined. The experimental findings were compared with previous NMR studies as well as with DFT calculations performed in this work. The DFT results not only supported the assignment of crystallographically distinct 17O sites but also revealed previously unobserved antisymmetric components of the chemical shift tensors. This study presents the first comprehensive characterization of 17O NMR tensors in alanine enantiomers and underscores the power of integrating single-crystal ssNMR with X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations to advance our understanding of molecular chirality in amino acids.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in Hydrogen across the pressure-induced transition from molecular to atomic fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersion of collective excitations in fluid Hydrogen along the isothermal line T=2500~K, including the region of molecular-to-atomis fluid transition, is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The obtained density dependence of the adiabatic and high-frequency speed of sound contains a plateau in the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition. We show, that the five-variable thermo-viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics for pure molecular H$_2$ and pure atomic (H) fluids is able to recover perfectly the AIMD-derived time correlation functions and sound eigenvalues nicely agree with the numerically estimated sound dispersion. In the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition a dynamic model of chemical reacting mixture should be applied. We discuss the calculations of time correlation functions from molecular/atomic units in the reacting mixture from AIMD trajectories.</description>

      <title>Strong anharmonicity dictates ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type-I clathrate solids have attracted significant interest due to their ultralow thermal conductivities and subsequent promise for thermoelectric applications, yet the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well understood. Here, we extend the framework of vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to calculate temperature-dependent thermal transport properties of $X_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where $X=$ Ba, Sr, using a many-body Green's function approach. We find that nonresonant scattering between cage acoustic modes and rattling modes leads to a reduction of acoustic phonon lifetimes and thus thermal conductivities. Moreover, we find that the moderate temperature dependence of conductivities above 300 K, which is consistent with experimental measurements, cannot be reproduced by standard perturbation theory calculations, which predict a $T^{-1}$ dependence. Therefore, we conclude that nonperturbative anharmonic effects, including four- and higher-phonon scattering processes, are responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>
