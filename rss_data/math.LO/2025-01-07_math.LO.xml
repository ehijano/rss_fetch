      <title>Sequent calculus for the subintuitionistic logic ${\sf WF_{N_{2}}} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cut-free G3-style sequent calculus GWFN2 for the subintuitionistic logic WFN2, along with its single-succedent variant GWFsN2, is introduced. The calculus GWFN2 is shown to extend naturally to a G3-style of the sequent calculus GF for Corsis logic F. Additionally, a syntactic proof of the known embedding of GWFN2 into classical modal logic MNec is presented.</description>

      <title>Collision-resistant hash-shuffles on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oneway real functions are effective maps on positive-measure sets of reals that preserve randomness and have no effective probabilistic inversions. We construct a oneway real function which is collision-resistant: the probability of effectively producing distinct reals with the same image is zero, and each real has uncountable inverse image.</description>

      <title>Any function I can actually write down is measurable, right?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository paper aimed at a general mathematical audience, we discuss how to combine certain classic theorems of set-theoretic inner model theory and effective descriptive set theory with work on Hilbert's tenth problem and universal Diophantine equations to produce the following surprising result: There is a specific polynomial $p(x,y,z,n,k_1,\dots,k_{70})$ of degree $7$ with integer coefficients such that it is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ (and much stronger theories) whether the function $$f(x) = \inf_{y \in \mathbb{R}}\sup_{z \in \mathbb{R}}\inf_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\sup_{\bar{k} \in \mathbb{N}^{70}}p(x,y,z,n,\bar{k})$$ is Lebesgue measurable. We also give similarly defined $g(x,y)$ with the property that the statement "$x \mapsto g(x,r)$ is measurable for every $r \in \mathbb{R}$" has large cardinal consistency strength (and in particular implies the consistency of $\mathsf{ZFC}$) and $h(m,x,y,z)$ such that $h(1,x,y,z),\dots,h(16,x,y,z)$ can consistently be the indicator functions of a Banach$\unicode{x2013}$Tarski paradoxical decomposition of the sphere.
  Finally, we discuss some situations in which measurability of analogously defined functions can be concluded by inspection, which touches on model-theoretic o-minimality and the fact that sufficiently strong large cardinal hypotheses (such as Vop\v{e}nka's principle and much weaker assumptions) imply that all 'reasonably definable' functions (including the above $f(x)$, $g(x,y)$, and $h(m,x,y,z)$) are universally measurable.</description>

      <title>Bowen's Problem 32 and the conjugacy problem for systems with specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Rufus Bowen's Problem 32 on the classification of symbolic systems with the specification property does not admit a solution that would use concrete invariants. To this end, we construct a class of symbolic systems with the specification property and show that the conjugacy relation on this class is too complicated to admit such a classification. More generally, we gauge the complexity of the classification problem for symbolic systems with the specification property. Along the way, we also provide answers to two questions related to the classification of pointed systems with the specification property: to a question of Ding and Gu related to the complexity of the classification of pointed Cantor systems with the specification property and to a question of Bruin and Vejnar related to the complexity of the classification of pointed Hilbert cube systems with the specification property.</description>

      <title>Partitions of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into unit circles with no well-ordering of the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a well-ordering on the reals, one can prove there exists a partition of the three-dimensional Euclidean space into unit circles (PUC). We show that the converse does not hold: there exist models of $\mathsf{ZF}$ without a well-ordering of the reals in which such partition exists. Specifically, we prove that the Cohen model has a PUC and construct a model satisfying $\mathsf{DC}$ where this is also the case. Furthermore, we present a general framework for constructing similar models for other paradoxical sets, under some conditions of extendability and amalgamation.</description>

      <title>On groups and fields interpretable in $\mathrm{NTP_2}$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims at developing model-theoretic tools to study interpretable fields and definably amenable groups, mainly in $\mathrm{NIP}$ or $\mathrm{NTP_2}$ settings. An abstract theorem constructing definable group homomorphisms from generic data is proved. It relies heavily on a stabilizer theorem of Montenegro, Onshuus and Simon. The main application is a structure theorem for definably amenable groups that are interpretable in algebraically bounded perfect $\mathrm{NTP_2}$ fields with bounded Galois group (under some mild assumption on the imaginaries involved), or in algebraically bounded theories of (differential) NIP fields. These imply a classification of the fields interpretable in differentially closed valued fields, and structure theorems for fields interpretable in finitely ramified henselian valued fields of characteristic $0$, or in NIP algebraically bounded differential fields.</description>

      <title>Models for common knowledge logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss models of the common knowledge logic. The common knowledge logic is a multi-modal logic that includes the modal operators $\mathsf{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), $\mathsf{E}$, and $\mathsf{C}$. The intended meanings of $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), $\mathsf{E}\phi$, and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ are ''the agent $i$ knows $\phi$'' ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), ''everyone in $\mathcal{I}$ knows $\phi$'', and ''$\phi$ is common knowledge among $\mathcal{I}$'', respectively. Then, the models of these formulas are required to satisfy the following conditions: $\mathsf{E}\phi$ is true if and only if $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ is true for every $i\in\mathcal{I}$, and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ is true if and only if all of $\phi$, $\mathsf{E}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{2}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{3}\phi,\ldots$ are true. A suitable Kripke frame for this is $\langle W,R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}} (i\in\mathcal{I}), R_{\mathsf{C}}\rangle$, where $R_{\mathsf{C}}$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of $R_{\mathsf{E}}=\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}}$. We refer to such Kripke frames as CKL-frames. Additionally, an algebra suitable for this is a modal algebra with modal operators $\mathrm{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), $\mathrm{E}$, and $\mathrm{C}$, which satisfies that $\mathrm{E} x=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \mathrm{K}_{i} x$, $\mathrm{C} x\leq\mathrm{E}\mathrm{C} x$, and $\mathrm{C} x$ is the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$. We refer to such modal algebras as CKL-algebras. In this paper, we show that the class of CKL-frames is modally definable, but the class of CKL-algebras is not, which means that the class of CKL-algebras is not a variety.</description>

      <title>Generic Solutions of Equations Involving the Modular $j$-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a modular version of Schanuel's conjecture and the modular Zilber-Pink conjecture, we show that the existence of generic solutions of certain families of equations involving the modular $j$ function can be reduced to the problem of finding a Zariski dense set of solutions. By imposing some conditions on the field of definition of the variety, we are also able to obtain unconditional versions of this result.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>
