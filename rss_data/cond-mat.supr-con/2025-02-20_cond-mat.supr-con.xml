      <title>Violation of Pauli Limit at KTaO3(110) Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting order parameter at the KTaO3 interfaces and its dependence on interface orientation remains a subject of debate. The superconductivity at these interfaces exhibits strong resilience against in-plane magnetic field and violates Pauli limit. The interface orientation dependence of critical field and violation of Pauli limit, however, have not been investigated. To address this problem, we grew epitaxial LaMnO3/KTaO3 heterostructures using molecular beam epitaxy. We show that superconductivity is extremely robust against the in-plane magnetic field. Our results indicate that the interface orientation, despite impacting the critical temperature, does not affect the ratio of critical field to the Pauli limiting field. These results offer opportunities to engineer superconductors which are resilient against magnetic field.</description>

      <title>An unusual first order phase transition in a 2D superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a superconductor under external perturbation, which forces Cooper pairs to develop with a finite total momentum $q$. The condensation energy of such a state decreases with $q$ and vanishes at a critical $q_c$. We analyze how superconducting order evolves at $ q \approx q_c$. In 3D, the result is well-known: the pairing susceptibility diverges at $q = q_c +0$, and the gap amplitude $\Delta (q)$ gradually increases as $q$ decreases below $q_c$ and reaches its largest value $\Delta_0$ at $q=0$. In 2D, we find different behavior. Namely, for a parabolic dispersion, the pairing susceptibility also diverges at $q = q_c +0$, but at $q = q_c -0$, the gap amplitude jumps to the maximal $\Delta_0$ and remains equal to it for all $q &lt;q_c$. For a non-parabolic dispersion $\varepsilon_{k}= c k^{2\alpha}$, we find that for $\alpha&gt;1$ the transition becomes second-order, but the gap evolution is rather sharp, whereas for $\alpha&lt;1$ it becomes first-order, but $\Delta (q)$ is non-monotonic. This is similar, but not identical, to the behavior of magnetization near a Stoner transition in 2D.</description>

      <title>Beyond Homes scaling: disorder, the Planckian bound and a new universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beginning with high-$T_c$ cuprate materials, it has been observed that many superconductors exhibit so-called "Homes scaling", in which the zero-temperature superfluid density, $\rho_{s0}$, is proportional to the product of the normal-state dc conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature, $\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c$. For conventional, s-wave superconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of elastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit but across a broad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous calculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d-wave superconductors, a stark contrast emerges, with $\rho_{s0} \propto \left(\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c \right)^2$ in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a simple approximate Migdal--Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we show how Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near optimally doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant deviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems, such as underdoped YBCO and overdoped LSCO, and in very clean materials with little inelastic scattering, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We present a revised analysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by the Drude plasma weight, $\omega_{p,D}^2$, and show that new universal scaling emerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s-wave and dirty d-wave superconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is occurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for classifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as scattering strength and character. Although our model starts from a Fermi-liquid assumption it describes underdoped cuprates surprisingly well.</description>

      <title>Origin of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points in monoclinic trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity was recently found in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure with a phase transition from the monoclinic P2$_1$/a structure to the tetragonal I4/mmm structure. Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting diode effect in higher-harmonic InSb nanosheet interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by the nonreciprocal supercurrent flow, have gained significant attention for their potential in dissipationless electronics. This study presents a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) composed of two Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions. Utilizing prepatterned local backgates, we achieve a gate- and flux-tunable superconducting diode with controllable efficiency in both amplitude and sign. Numerical simulations attribute the diode effect to higher harmonics in the current-phase relation. Crucially, fractional Shapiro step experiments provide direct insights into the evolution of these higher harmonics with flux tuning, showcasing significant enhancements in the second-harmonic signatures of the SQUID near half-integer flux quanta. Furthermore, we investigate the microwave-assisted diode response and experimentally show that the polarity of the diode effect can be switched by the microwave power. These results demonstrate the potential of InSb nanosheet-based hybrid devices as highly tunable elements for use in dissipationless electronics.</description>

      <title>AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome superconductors: a review with transport measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional, phonon-mediated superconductors, the transition temperature $T_c$ and normal-state scattering rate $1/\tau$ - deduced from the linear-in-temperature resistivity $\rho(T)$ - are linked through the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda_{\rm ph}$. In cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, no equivalent $\lambda$ has yet been identified, despite the fact that at high doping, $\alpha$ - the low-$T$ $T$-linear coefficient of $\rho(T)$ - also scales with $T_c$. Here, we use dc resistivity and high-field magnetoresistance to extract $\tau^{-1}$ in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) as a function of $x$ from optimal doping to beyond the superconducting dome. A highly anisotropic inelastic component to $\tau^{-1}$ is revealed whose magnitude diminishes markedly across the doping series. Using known Fermi surface parameters and subsequent modelling of the Hall coefficient, we demonstrate that the form of $\tau^{-1}$ in LCCO is consistent with scattering off commensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of variable strength $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. The clear correlation between $\alpha$, $\lambda_{\rm sf}$ and $T_c$ then identifies low-energy spin-fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in electron-doped cuprates. The contrasting magnetotransport behaviour in hole-doped cuprates suggests that the higher $T_c$ in the latter cannot be attributed solely to an increase in $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. Indeed, the success in modelling LCCO serves to reinforces the notion that resolving the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates may require more than a simple extension of BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Interfacial superconductivity in the type-III heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity (IS) has been a topic of intense interest in the condensed matter physics, due to its unique properties and exotic photoelectrical performance. However, there are few reports about IS systems consisting of two insulators. Here, motivated by the emergence of an insulator-metal transition in the type-III heterostructure and the superconductivity in the some "special" two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors via the electron doping, we predict that 2D heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ is a model system for realizing the IS by using first-principles calculations. Our results show that due to the slight but crucial interlayer charge transfer, SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ turns to be a type-III heterostructure with metallic properties and shows a superconducting transition with the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of 3.73 K. Similar to the enhance electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in the electron doped SnSe$_2$ monolayer, the IS in the heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ mainly originates from the metallized SnSe$_2$ layer. Furthermore, we find that the superconductivity is sensitive to the tensile lattice strain, forming a dome-shaped superconducting phase diagram. Remarkably, at the 7\% tensile strain, the superconducting $T_\text{c}$ can increase more than twofold (8.80 K), resulting from the softened acoustic phonon at the M point and the enhanced EPC strength. Our study provides a concrete example for realizing IS in the type-III heterosturcture, which waits for future experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Interfacial superconductivity and a Se-vacancy ordered insulating phase in the FeSe/PbOx heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3 has sparked significant interests in exploring new superconducting systems with engineered interfaces. Here, using molecular beam epitaxy growth, we successfully fabricate FeSe/PbOx heterostructures and discover superconductivities in three different monolayer FeSe-related interfaces. We observe superconducting gaps of 13~14 meV in the monolayer FeSe films grown on two different phases of PbOx. Moreover, we discover a new insulating Fe10Se9 phase with an ordered $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ Se-vacancy structure. Our first-principles calculation suggests that this new insulating phase originates from electronic correlation. Intriguingly, an additional monolayer FeSe film grown on the insulating Fe10Se9 also exhibits superconductivity with the gap size of 5 meV. Our results suggest that the work function differences between the monolayer FeSe and the substrates, which can induce band bending and charge transfer, are crucial for the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the crystal structure of the bilayer nickel oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings and degree of geometrical frustration are systematically tuned.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$</title>

Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: In the intricate phase diagram of unconventional superconductors characterized by intertwined electronic orders and superconductivity, a key step in understanding the superconducting mechanism is to investigate the parent compounds from which superconductivity emerges through doping or pressure. In this study, we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to examine the density wave instability in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which displays pressure-induced superconductivity up to 30 K. Our optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ behaves as a metal with a high plasma frequency. Upon cooling, we observed a distinct formation of a density wave energy gap in both optical conductivity and pump-probe measurements. The gap feature is more pronounced compared to the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparison of the experimentally determined plasma frequency with first-principles calculations, we classify La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ as a moderately electron-correlated material, resembling the parent compound of iron-based superconductors but exhibiting weaker correlation than the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. The enhanced gap feature and weaker electronic correlation in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ may explain its lower superconductivity transition temperature under high pressure. These findings significantly advance our comprehension of the density wave and superconductivity mechanisms in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>
