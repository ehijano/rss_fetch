      <title>Topological Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial in global healthcare, but the traditional receive coils, as a core component of MRI, SNR enhancement is limited due to the optimization of channel number and magnetic field strength faces high cost and complexity challenges. Here, we demonstrate the use of a topological material to enhance MRI signal reception. Designed with a stack of weak couplings, this material forms quasi-two-dimensional dual topological boundary states. High properties are achieved through low-loss signal transmission via these topological states, as well as only enhanced local magnetic fields and increased number of channels. Initial tests demonstrate superior performance and accessibility compared to commercial coils, suggesting significant potential. This concept introduces a transformative paradigm for all MRI coil designs.</description>

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: I. Spatio-Temporal Imaging of Wave Packets in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.</description>

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: III. Tailoring Complex Spatio-Temporal Focusing Laws To Overcome Reverberations in Reflection Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. In complex media, a fundamental limit is the multiple scattering phenomenon that completely blurs the imaging process in depth. Matrix imaging can provide a relevant framework for solving this problem. As it proved to be an adequate tool for probing reverberations in speckle [E. Giraudat et al., Part I], we will show how it can be used to tailor complex spatio-temporal focusing laws to monitor the interference between the multiply-reflected paths and the ballistic component of the wave-field. To do so, we extend the distortion matrix concept to the frequency domain. An iterative phase reversal process operated from the space-time Fourier space is then used to compensate for reverberations and optimize both the axial and transverse resolution of the confocal image. Here, we first present an experimental proof-of-concept consisting in imaging a tissue-mimicking phantom through a reverberating plate before outlining the potential and the limits of this strategy for transcranial ultrasound and beyond.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned optical microcomb emerging between octave separated lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot single photon source on SiN integrated with coupled crossover waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid integration of InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) single-photon sources (SPSs) is a promising approach for introducing quantum light into SiN photonic integrated circuits. However, the large refractive-index mismatch between GaAs and SiN poses a challenge for efficient optical coupling. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate hybrid integration of an InAs/GaAs QD-SPS on SiN using a coupled crossover waveguide structure. A photonic crystal nanocavity is employed for coupling QD emission into a GaAs waveguide, which efficiently transfers photons to a SiN waveguide at the crossover section. We observed Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission, on-chip propagation, and outcoupling through a SiN grating coupler.</description>

      <title>Photonic neuromorphic processing with coupled spiking silicon microrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical computing mechanisms of individual network nodes is essential for scaling neuromorphic photonic architectures. This work proposes a compact passive nonlinear photonic core based on a Side-Coupled Integrated Spaced Sequence of Resonators (SCISSOR) made of three nominally equal microrings and investigate its computing capabilities. Its nonlinearities and internal feedback enable analogue, spiking, and bistable responses that are accessed by tuning the injection power and wavelength. Implemented as a single nonlinear node in a time-multiplexed reservoir computing, the SCISSOR achieves error-free classification on the Iris dataset and accuracies above 97% on the Sonar task, using both analogue and digital reservoir representations with 150 virtual nodes. In the digital scheme, spiking dynamics naturally generate sparse reservoir states, enabling efficient classification even with a single spike. Intriguingly, optimal operating points are at the boundaries where sharp transitions in dynamical complexity and/or output power occur. In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training. Spiking and thermal bistabilities also participate to enhance the computational performance at low injected powers below 4 mW. These results suggest optical coupled microring resonators as effective building blocks for future edge computing and neuromorphic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise scaling in continuously operating multiparameter sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.</description>

      <title>Westcott $g$ Factors Extended to Arbitrary Neutron Energy Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Westcott $g$ factors are used in Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Prompt Gamma-ray Activation Analysis (PGAA) to evaluate the impact of non-$1/v$ behavior in the neutron-capture cross sections of certain nuclei on activation product yields. This non-$1/v$ behavior arises from the presence of neutron resonances in the neutron-capture cross sections that overlap with the source neutron spectrum at low ($&lt;5$~eV) energies. Historically, Westcott $g$ factors that have been cataloged for NAA and PGAA applications are the result of calculations that assume a Maxwellian neutron velocity distribution with a given average temperature. In this study, we use this approach with updated neutron-capture cross sections from the Evaluated Nuclear Data File, version VIII.1 (ENDF/B-VIII.1) to tabulate Westcott $g$ factor values for a broad range of Maxwellian distribution temperatures, comparing the results against currently-available $g$ factors from International Atomic Energy Agency tables and other sources. It was discovered during this analysis that the use of guided thermal and cold-neutron beams at certain facilities necessitates an approach for evaluating Westcott $g$ factors based on arbitrary non-Maxwellian spectra. In this paper, we present an approach for calculating $g$ factors with user-specified neutron spectra, and we apply these methods to obtain Westcott $g$-factors for guided- and cold-neutron beams at the Budapest Research Reactor and the Forschungsreaktor M{\"u}nchen II reactor. Open-source software has been developed as part of this study that can be used to perform these calculations for applications in PGAA and NAA experiments</description>

      <title>Comparison of time-resolved photoluminescence and deep-level transient spectroscopy defect evaluations in an InAs nBn detector subjected to in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-level transient spectroscopy and temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence experiments are performed on identical InAs nBn photodetector structures as a function of in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation to assess their generation and recombination dynamics. Pre-irradiation, the n-type InAs absorbing region exhibits a steadily increasing minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature, providing evidence that excited minority carriers may be recombining via shallow defect levels. From deep-level transient spectroscopy, two features are found between 10 K and 275 K: a low temperature broad shoulder, which suggests emission from multiple shallow electron defect levels with energies &lt; 29 meV, and a high temperature minimum occurring at approximately 230 K with an activation energy of 539 meV, which suggests a defect in the barrier layer in the device. Two similar nBn detectors are then subjected to 63 MeV proton irradiation in step doses and measured between steps. One experiment is performed in-situ with an nBn held at approximately 10 K during dosing, and the other experiment is performed ex-situ with a similar nBn held at room temperature for dosing. The ex-situ dosing results in an evaluation of the defect introduction rate that is three to four times lower than in-situ due to partial annealing of the proton-induced displacement damage at room temperature. The results for these two experiments are then compared with the dose-dependent recombination rate analysis, resulting in an estimated recombination defect cross-section of 1.6x10^(-13) cm^2 for the shallow shoulder defect.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Mechanical Fingerprints for THz Sensing of 'Hidden' Nanoparticles in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.</description>

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: II. Gouy Phase Shift for Defocus Correction and Pixel Depth Reassignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for aberration correction and reverberation compensation in reflection imaging. When probing heterogeneous media with waves, we have to cope with multi-scale fluctuations of the wave velocity. On the one hand, short-scale heterogeneities induce back-scattered echoes whose random interference generate a speckle pattern on the beamformed image. On the other hand, large-scale fluctuations of the wave-velocity can distort the focused wave-fronts, resulting in aberrations on the same image. In this paper, we show how the self-portrait of the wave evolves as a function of the speed-of-sound model. Strikingly, a Gouy phase shift is observed when the speed-of-sound model is optimal. This particularly sensitive feature enables: (i) an optimization of the speed-of-sound model for each pixel of the image; (ii) a local and fine compensation of defocus across the field-of-view, thereby compensating for most aberrations in the image. Experiment in a tissue-mimicking phantom and numerical simulations are first presented to validate our method. It is then applied to in-vivo liver data of a difficult-to-image patient. The speed-of-sound optimization allows an axial compensation of aberrations and a depth-reassignment of each singly-scattered echo to the actual position of the associated scatterer. As distance measurement is often critical for diagnosis, such a wave speed optimization can be crucial for ultrasound but also for any other imaging methods based on the principle of echo-location.</description>
