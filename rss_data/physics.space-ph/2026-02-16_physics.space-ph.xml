      <title>Parker Solar Probe observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events with inverse velocity arrival (IVA) features</title>

Abstract: In SEP events, velocity dispersion (VD) is characterized by the earlier arrival of faster, higher-energy particles relative to slower ones, assuming negligible acceleration time and transport effects. The "Labor Day event" at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 September 5 provided a unique arrival profile, in which the medium energy (~ few MeV) particles arrive earlier than both lower and higher energy particles. This created a so-called "nose" structure in the intensity spectrogram formed by measurements from the two energetic particle instruments, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, of the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) suite. Unlike typical VD, the delayed arrival of higher energy particles compared to medium energy particles, i.e., the "inverse velocity arrival" (IVA), could be caused by various acceleration, transport, and instrumental effects, including shock acceleration. By applying a new method based on the contour-line of the intensity, we found 14 IVA events in the ISOIS observations up to the end of 2024. Several parameters that may modify velocity dispersion characteristics are further explored including the spacecraft radial distance, the speed of corresponding CMEs and shocks, the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint longitudinal separation from the flare location. The energy of the early arriving particles, i.e., the nose energy, can be grouped into low (L, &lt;0.5 MeV), medium(M, 0.5 - 5 MeV), and high(H, &gt;5 MeV) categories. Most (11/14) of the IVA events have medium nose energies. This SEP list provides ingredients for examination of shock acceleration in the inner heliosphere, and the existence of IVA events sheds new light on the acceleration and propagation of SEPs.</description>

      <title>Real-time prediction of geomagnetic storms using Solar Orbiter as a far upstream solar wind monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first real-time predictions of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic structure and resulting geomagnetic impact at Earth for two events using far-upstream observations from Solar Orbiter during March 2024. While our approach assumes idealized conditions for CME propagation and scaling, in situ magnetic field data from upstream monitors still produced realistic predictions despite the large heliocentric distance between Solar Orbiter and L1 (0.53 and 0.60 au). Geomagnetic index predictions were made 15.3 and 4.3 hours before the CME shock arrival at L1, and 33.9 and 10.3 hours ahead of peak storm time; a large improvement over current L1-based nowcasting capabilities. Analysis reveals that simple drag-based models, when observationally constrained by upstream in situ observations, improved arrival time estimates, comparable to more complex models, though arrival time errors of several hours persist. Our results show that good predictions of CME magnetic structure and geomagnetic indices with actionable lead-times can be made with far upstream spacecraft, even with longitudinal separations up to 10{\deg} from the Sun-Earth line, over heliocentric distance ranges where radial evolution effects dominate over longitudinal effects. Limitations include different expansion behaviors for individual CMEs and regions within. Future missions providing continuous data, including solar wind plasma parameters alongside magnetic field measurements, could account for preexisting disturbed conditions and improve geomagnetic prediction accuracy. Our findings demonstrate the substantial value of real-time upstream solar wind measurements for enhancing geomagnetic forecasting accuracy at Earth and provide critical validation for future dedicated upstream space weather missions.</description>
