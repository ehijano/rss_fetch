      <title>Target Defense Using a Turret and Mobile Defender Team</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scenario is considered wherein a stationary, turn constrained agent (Turret) and a mobile agent (Defender) cooperate to protect the former from an adversarial mobile agent (Attacker). The Attacker wishes to reach the Turret prior to getting captured by either the Defender or Turret, if possible. Meanwhile, the Defender and Turret seek to capture the Attacker as far from the Turret as possible. This scenario is formulated as a differential game and solved using a geometric approach. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the Turret-Defender team winning and the Attacker winning are given. In the case of the Turret-Defender team winning equilibrium strategies for the min max terminal distance of the Attacker to the Turret are given. Three cases arise corresponding to solo capture by the Defender, solo capture by the Turret, and capture simultaneously by both Turret and Defender.</description>

      <title>Automatic Regression for Governing Equations with Control (ARGOSc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the governing equations of dynamical systems from data has drawn significant attention across diverse fields, including physics, engineering, robotics and control, economics, climate science, and healthcare. Sparse regression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting parsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical systems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions, which standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS with control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control inputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse regression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the effects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics in low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz system with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in discovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the widely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc), in accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc fails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently succeeds.</description>

      <title>High-Gain Voltage-Multiplier Coupled Quadratic Boost Converter: A New Design for Small Scale PV Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a single-switch high-gain voltage-multiplier coupled quadratic boost converter (HGVM-QBC), developed from the conventional quadratic boost converter (QBC). The proposed topology is designed to achieve higher voltage gain, lower semiconductor voltage stress, and continuous current operation, making it particularly suitable for small-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems. By incorporating a voltage multiplier cell into the QBC, the converter significantly improves voltage boosting capability while mitigating stress on switching devices. In this configuration, the output voltage is obtained by combining the voltages across multiple output capacitors, thereby enhancing the overall voltage level. A detailed comparative study with recently reported converter topologies demonstrates the superior gain and reduced device stress offered by the HGVM-QBC. The design is validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, which confirm improved performance in terms of gain and voltage stress. Furthermore, an experimental prototype achieves an output of 151 Vdc from a 12 Vdc input at a 55% duty cycle, corresponding to a gain of 12.59. These results establish the HGVM-QBC as an efficient and reliable solution for PV applications that demand high voltage output from low input sources.</description>

      <title>EDMD-Based Robust Observer Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data driven Koopman operator based framework for designing robust state observers for nonlinear systems. Based on a finite dimensional surrogate of the Koopman generator, identified via an extended dynamic mode decomposition procedure, a tractable formulation of the observer design is enabled on the data driven model with conic uncertainties. The resulting problem is cast as a semidefinite program with linear matrix inequalities, guaranteeing exponential convergence of the observer with a predetermined rate in a probabilistic sense. The approach bridges the gap between statistical error tolerance and observer convergence certification, and enables an explicit use of linear systems theory for state observation via a data driven linear surrogate model. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Off Policy Lyapunov Stability in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Predictions in Power System Voltage Control: An Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High variability of solar PV and sudden changes in load (e.g., electric vehicles and storage) can lead to large voltage fluctuations in the distribution system. In recent years, a number of controllers have been designed to optimize voltage control. These controllers, however, almost always assume that the net load in the system remains constant over a sufficiently long time, such that the control actions converge before the load changes again. Given the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable resources, it is becoming important to explicitly consider net load that is time-varying.
  This paper proposes an adaptive approach to voltage control in power systems with significant time-varying net load. We leverage advances in short-term load forecasting, where the net load in the system can be partially predicted using local measurements. We integrate these predictions into the design of adaptive controllers, and prove that the overall control architecture achieves input-to-state stability in a decentralized manner. We optimize the control policy through reinforcement learning. Case studies are conducted using time-varying load data from a real-world distribution system.</description>

      <title>Ruggedized Ultrasound Sensing in Harsh Conditions: eRTIS in the wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present eRTIS, a rugged, embedded ultrasound sensing system for use in harsh industrial environments. The system features a broadband capacitive transducer and a 32-element MEMS microphone array capable of 2D and 3D beamforming. A modular hardware architecture separates sensing and processing tasks: a high-performance microcontroller handles excitation signal generation and data acquisition, while an NVIDIA Jetson module performs GPU-accelerated signal processing. eRTIS supports external synchronization via a custom controller that powers and coordinates up to six devices, either simultaneously or in a defined sequence. Additional synchronization options include bidirectional triggering and in-band signal injection. A sealed, anodized aluminum enclosure with passive cooling and IP-rated connectors ensures reliability in challenging conditions. Performance is demonstrated in three field scenarios: harbor mooring, off-road robotics, and autonomous navigation in cluttered environments, demonstrates that eRTIS provides robust sensing in situations where optical systems degrade.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Geometry of Faulted Power Systems under High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources via Ellipse Fitting and Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) present significant challenges for conventional protection schemes, with traditional distance protection methods failing to detect line-to-line faults during asymmetric conditions. This paper presents a methodology for electrical fault detection and classification using ellipse fitting and geometric algebra applied to voltage and current space curves. The approach characterizes electrical faults by fitting ellipses to voltage vector data, enabling fault detection with only a quarter-cycle. The method employs bivector components for line-to-ground fault classification, while ellipse parameters identify line-to-line and three-phase faults. The geometric representation preserves voltage or current curve shapes in three-dimensional space, overcoming Clarke transform limitations when zero-sequence components are present. Validation using simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates accurate fault identification and magnitude estimation, providing enhanced power system protection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Data-driven optimization of sparse sensor placement in thermal hydraulic experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal-Hydraulic (TH) experiments provide valuable insight into the physics of heat and mass transfer and qualified data for code development, calibration and validation. However, measurements are typically collected from sparsely distributed sensors, offering limited coverage over the domain of interest and phenomena of interest. Determination of the spatial configuration of these sensors is crucial and challenging during the pre-test design stage. This paper develops a data-driven framework for optimizing sensor placement in TH experiments, including (i) a sensitivity analysis to construct datasets, (ii) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for dimensionality reduction, and (iii) QR factorization with column pivoting to determine optimal sensor configuration under spatial constraints. The framework is demonstrated on a test conducted in the TALL-3D Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) loop. In this case, the utilization of optical techniques, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), are impractical. Thereby the quantification of momentum and energy transport relies heavily on readings from Thermocouples (TCs). The test section was previously instrumented with many TCs determined through a manual process combining simulation results with expert judgement. The proposed framework provides a systematic and automated approach for sensor placement. The resulting TCs exhibit high sensitivity to the variation of uncertain input parameters and enable accurate full field reconstruction while maintaining robustness against measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis and Verification of String Stable Neural Certificates for Interconnected Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring string stability is critical for the safety and efficiency of large-scale interconnected systems. Although learning-based controllers (e.g., those based on reinforcement learning) have demonstrated strong performance in complex control scenarios, their black-box nature hinders formal guarantees of string stability. To address this gap, we propose a novel verification and synthesis framework that integrates discrete-time scalable input-to-state stability (sISS) with neural network verification to formally guarantee string stability in interconnected systems. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we establish a formal framework for synthesizing and robustly verifying discrete-time scalable input-to-state stability (sISS) certificates for neural network-based interconnected systems. Specifically, our approach extends the notion of sISS to discrete-time settings, constructs neural sISS certificates, and introduces a verification procedure that ensures string stability while explicitly accounting for discrepancies between the true dynamics and their neural approximations. Second, we establish theoretical foundations and algorithms to scale the training and verification pipeline to large-scale interconnected systems. Third, we extend the framework to handle systems with external control inputs, thereby allowing the joint synthesis and verification of neural certificates and controllers. Fourth, we validate our approach in scenarios of mixed-autonomy platoons, drone formations, and microgrids. Numerical simulations show that the proposed framework not only guarantees sISS with minimal degradation in control performance but also efficiently trains and verifies controllers for large-scale interconnected systems under specific practical conditions.</description>

      <title>MPC for Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage Systems Using ARX Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) can mitigate CO2 emissions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings. In application, an ATES keeps large quantities of thermal energy in groundwater-saturated aquifers. Normally, an ATES system comprises two (one for heat and one for cold) storages and supports the heating and cooling efforts of simultaneously present HVAC system components. This way, the operation and emissions of installed and, usually, fossil fuel-based components are reduced.
  The control of ATES systems is challenging, and various control schemes, including model predictive control (MPC), have been proposed. In this context, we present a lightweight input-output-data-based autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model of the hybrid ATES system dynamics. The ARX model allows the design of an output-based MPC scheme, resulting in an easy-to-solve quadratic program and avoiding challenging state estimations of ground temperatures. A numerical study discusses the accuracy of the ARX predictor and controller performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Constraint Surrogate Model for Two-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations, making traditional deterministic unit commitment approaches computationally expensive. This paper presents a machine learning surrogate modeling approach designed to reformulate the feasible design space of the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (TSUC) problem, reducing its computational complexity. The proposed method uses a support vector machine (SVM) to construct a surrogate model based on the governing equations of the learner. This model replaces the original 2|L| * |S| transmission line flow constraints, where |S| is the number of uncertainty scenarios and |L| is the number of transmission lines with |S| much less than |L|, with a significantly reduced set of 1 * |S| linear inequality constraints. The approach is theoretically grounded in the polyhedral structure of the feasible region under the DC power flow approximation, enabling the transformation of 2|L| line flow limit constraints into a single linear constraint. The surrogate model is trained using data generated from computationally efficient DC optimal power flow simulations. Simulation results on the IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrate SVM halfspace constraint accuracy of 99.72% and 99.88%, respectively, with TSUC computational time reductions of 46% and 31% and negligible generation cost increases (0.63% and 0.88% on average for IEEE 57- and 118-bus systems, respectively). This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for practical power system operations under renewable energy uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.</description>

      <title>Merging Physics-Based Synthetic Data and Machine Learning for Thermal Monitoring of Lithium-ion Batteries: The Role of Data Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the internal temperature is less accessible than surface temperature, there is an urgent need to develop accurate and real-time estimation algorithms for better thermal management and safety. This work presents a novel framework for resource-efficient and scalable development of accurate, robust, and adaptive internal temperature estimation algorithms by blending physics-based modeling with machine learning, in order to address the key challenges in data collection, model parameterization, and estimator design that traditionally hinder both approaches. In this framework, a physics-based model is leveraged to generate simulation data that includes different operating scenarios by sweeping the model parameters and input profiles. Such a cheap simulation dataset can be used to pre-train the machine learning algorithm to capture the underlying mapping relationship. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap resulting from imperfect modeling, transfer learning with unsupervised domain adaptation is applied to fine-tune the pre-trained machine learning model, by using limited operational data (without internal temperature values) from target batteries. The proposed framework is validated under different operating conditions and across multiple cylindrical batteries with convective air cooling, achieving a root mean square error of 0.5 {\deg}C when relying solely on prior knowledge of battery thermal properties, and less than 0.1 {\deg}C when using thermal parameters close to the ground truth. Furthermore, the role of the simulation data quality in the proposed framework has been comprehensively investigated to identify promising ways of synthetic data generation to guarantee the performance of the machine learning model.</description>

Abstract: We propose a control barrier function (CBF) formulation for enforcing equality and inequality constraints in variational inference. The key idea is to define a barrier functional on the space of probability density functions that encode the desired constraints imposed on the variational density. By leveraging the Liouville equation, we establish a connection between the time derivative of the variational density and the particle drift, which enables the systematic construction of corresponding CBFs associated to the particle drift. Enforcing these CBFs gives rise to the safe particle flow and ensures that the variational density satisfies the original constraints imposed by the barrier functional. This formulation provides a principled and computationally tractable solution to constrained variational inference, with theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Identification of Linear Models with Integrating Disturbances for Offset-Free Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report addresses the maximum likelihood identification of models for offset-free model predictive control, where linear time-invariant models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.</description>

      <title>Simple controller design to achieve iso-damping robustness: Non-iterative data-driven approach based on fractional-order reference model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple controller design approach to achieve a class of robustness, the so-called iso-damping property. The proposed approach can be executed using only one-shot input/output data. An accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant is not required. The model-reference control problem is defined to achieve the desired closed-loop specifications, including the iso-damping, and the reference model is designed on the basis of fractional-order calculus. The optimization problem for the model-reference control is formulated using the one-shot input/output data while considering the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. The iso-damping robust controller is obtained by solving the optimization problem. The representative advantages of the proposed approach over the conventional methods are the simplicity, practicality, and reliability from the viewpoint of the unnecessity of the plant model and explicit consideration of the BIBO stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. Numerical and experimental studies demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sparse Actuation for LPV Systems with Full-State Feedback in $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sparse actuation problem for nonlinear systems represented in the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. We propose a convex optimization framework that concurrently determines actuator magnitude limits and the state-feedback law that guarantees a user-specified closed-loop performance in the $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense. We also demonstrate that sparse actuation is achieved when the actuator magnitude-limits are minimized in the $l_1$ sense. This is the first paper that addresses this problem for LPV systems. The formulation is demonstrated in a vibration control problem for a flexible wing.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks in Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers the controller synthesis problem for general MIMO systems with unknown dynamics, aiming to fulfill the temporal reach-avoid-stay task, where the unsafe regions are time-dependent, and the target must be reached within a specified time frame. The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</description>

      <title>Nuisance-free Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System Design: Merging Exponential-CBF and Adaptive Sliding Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significance of the automatic ground collision avoidance system (Auto-GCAS) has been proven by considering the fatal crashes that have occurred over decades. Even though extensive efforts have been put forth to address the ground collision avoidance in the literature, the notion of being nuisance-free has not been sufficiently addressed. At this point, in this study, the Auto-GCAS design is formulated by merging exponential control barrier functions with sliding manifolds to manipulate the barrier function dynamics. The adaptive properties of the sliding manifolds are tailored to the key and governing flight parameters, ensuring that the nuisance-free requirement is satisfied. Furthermore, to ensure all safety requirements are met, a flight envelope protection algorithm is designed using control barrier functions to assess the commands generated by the Auto-GCAS. Eventually, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, focusing on authority-sharing, collision avoidance capability, and nuisance-free operation through various scenarios and Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control-Based Optimal Energy Management of Autonomous Electric Vehicles Under Cold Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.</description>

      <title>General Reference Frame Identification and Transformation in Unbalanced Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinate transformations provide dimensional reduction benefits across power system analysis, electric machine modeling, and power electronic converter control. This paper introduces a novel transformation based on Geometric Algebra that directly identifies the plane containing unbalanced quantity loci through bivector analysis. The method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems, requiring only two voltage or current measurements at different time instants. Through pure geometric reasoning, we demonstrate that our approach generalizes existing techniques while extending naturally to multi-dimensional systems. Experimental validation using real-time digital simulation and physical laboratory testing confirms the method's effectiveness under realistic conditions. Power electronics converter control implementation demonstrates significant practical advantages, eliminating zero component oscillations present in Clarke transformation under unbalanced conditions and enabling more effective control architectures. The combination of computational efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability represents a significant advancement for power system control applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis and Exclusion Hypothesis of $\alpha$-Approximation Method for Discretizing Analog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.</description>

      <title>Tangential Action Spaces: Geometry, Memory and Cost in Holonomic and Nonholonomic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems balance energetic efficiency with the capacity for path-dependent effects. We introduce Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a geometric framework that models embodied agents as hierarchies of manifolds linked by projections from physical states to cognitive representations and onward to intentions. Lifts from intentions back to actions may follow multiple routes that differ in energy cost and in whether they leave memory-like traces. Under explicit assumptions, we prove: (i) if the physical-to-cognitive map is locally invertible, there is a unique lift that minimises instantaneous energy and yields no path-dependent memory; any memory requires strictly positive excess energy. (ii) If multiple physical states map to a cognitive state (a fibration), the energy-minimising lift is the metric-weighted pseudoinverse of the projection. (iii) In systems with holonomy, excess energy grows quadratically with the size of the induced memory for sufficiently small loops, establishing a local cost-memory law. These results motivate a classification of embodied systems by the origin of path dependence: intrinsically conservative, conditionally conservative, geometrically nonconservative, and dynamically nonconservative. Numerical examples illustrate each case. We also present a reflective extension (rTAS) in which perception depends on a learnable model state; a block metric formalises an effort-learning trade-off, and cross-curvature terms couple physical and model holonomy. Simulations of single- and two-agent settings show role asymmetries and sensitivity to coupling. TAS provides a geometric language linking embodiment, memory, and energetic cost, yielding testable predictions and design guidelines for biological and robotic systems.</description>

      <title>A Conflicts-free, Speed-lossless KAN-based Reinforcement Learning Decision System for Interactive Driving in Roundabouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially mixed traffic with both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles. This paper presents a learning-based algorithm that promotes safe and efficient driving across varying roundabout traffic conditions. A deep Q-learning network is used to learn optimal strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabout scenarios, while a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) improves the AVs' environmental understanding. To further enhance safety, an action inspector filters unsafe actions, and a route planner optimizes driving efficiency. Moreover, model predictive control ensures stability and precision in execution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving fewer collisions, reduced travel time, and stable training with smooth reward convergence.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: Advances, Expert Insights, and A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</description>
