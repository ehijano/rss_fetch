      <title>Transverse momentum dependent factorisation in the target fragmentation region at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the differential cross-section for single-inclusive jet production with transverse momentum $P_\perp$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small Bjorken $x_{\rm Bj}$, mediated by a virtual photon with virtuality $Q^2$. Unlike most studies at small $x$, which focus on particle production in the current fragmentation region, we investigate the kinematic regime where the jet is produced in the target fragmentation hemisphere of the Breit frame, and with $P_\perp \ll Q$. For a longitudinally polarised photon, we demonstrate that this cross-section is not power suppressed in $P_\perp/Q$ and we derive a factorised expression in terms of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark and gluon fracture functions. Our formula, valid at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ at small $x$, is akin to the Altarelli-Martinelli identity for the longitudinal DIS structure function. Numerical estimates show that the quark TMD fracture function is the most sensitive to saturation effects in large nuclei.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The corresponding macroscopically large object in form of the AQN behaves as {\it chameleon}: it does not interact with the surrounding material in dilute environment and serves as perfect cold DM candidate. However, AQN becomes strongly interacting object in sufficiently dense environment. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events. In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance , etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also formulate a unique possible test which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL.</description>

      <title>Theory of resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the theory of resonances, focusing specifically on the spectrum of excited strongly interacting particles. After providing historical context starting from the atomic theory, we summarize the status of theoretical and experimental research. We discuss then the methodology to determine universal resonance parameter through the analytical properties of the transition amplitudes. For this, the main aspects of the $S$-matrix theory are introduced including some explicit calculations in simplified cases. In the last section, we summarize several frequently used amplitude types also making a connection to Effective Field Theories, as well as provide first glimpse into some more advanced applications to further resonance properties.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production off of highly virtual (and highly energetic) quarks, taking into account heavy quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as used in the $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy quark mass effects, thus allowing to explore heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have the hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>The $CP$ violations and branching ratios for $B_c^+\to D_{(s)}^+\pi^+\pi^-(K^{+}K^{-})$ from interference of the vector mesons in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the perturbative QCD approach utilizing $K_T$ factorization, we have investigated the CP violations and branching ratios in the decay processes of $B_{c}^{+}\to D_{(s)} ^{+}V(V\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})$ and $B_{c}^{+}\to D_{(s)}^{+}V(V\rightarrow K^{+}K^{-})$, where V denotes three vector mesons $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$. During the $V\to \pi^+\pi^-$ and $V\to K^+K^-$ decay processes, we incorporated the $\rho^{0}-\omega-\phi$ mixing mechanism to describe the amplitudes of these quasi-two-body decay processes. Within the interference regime of the three vector particles, we observed distinct changes in both CP violations and branching ratios. Furthermore, our study presents evidence for local CP violations and branching ratios that warrants further investigation through experiments.</description>

      <title>Novel method for determining the light quark mass ratio using $\eta'\to\eta \pi\pi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for extracting symmetry breaking effects from symmetry conserved three-body decays. The method is based on mapping the Dalitz plot to a unit disk, and the difference of the disk distributions of two related decays isolates purely symmetry breaking effects. We demonstrate this method by extracting the fundamental parameter $Q$, an isospin breaking ratio of light quark masses defined as $Q^2\equiv (m_s^2-\hat m^2)/(m_d^2-m_u^2)$ with $\hat m$ the average of up and down quark masses, from the decays $\eta'\to\eta\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\eta'\to\eta\pi^0\pi^0$. With the Dalitz plot distributions for these two decays reported by BESIII, we obtain $Q=22.3\pm0.7$, which is consistent with previous determinations and has a comparable uncertainty. With the full BESIII data set, which is eight times larger than the one used here, a significantly more precise determination of $Q$ will be achievable. This promising and novel method can be generalized to other three-body decays to extract symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Improving the Direct Determination of $|V_{ts}|$ using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $s$-jet tagging approach to determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix component $|V_{ts}|$ directly in the dileptonic final state events of the top pair production in proton-proton collisions has been previously studied by measuring the branching fraction of the decay of one of the top quarks by $t \to sW$. The main challenge is improving the discrimination performance between strange jets from top decays and other jets. This study proposes novel jet discriminators, called DISAJA, using a Transformer-based deep learning method. The first model, DISAJA-H, utilizes multi-domain inputs (jets, leptons, and missing transverse momentum). An additional model, DISAJA-L, further improves the setup by using lower-level jet constituent information, rather than the high-level clustered information. DISAJA-L is a novel model that combines low-level jet constituent analysis with event classification using multi-domain inputs. The model performance is evaluated via a CMS-like LHC Run 2 fast simulation by comparing various statistical test results to those from a model based on boosted decision trees. This study shows the deep learning model has a significant performance gain over the traditional machine learning method, and we show the potential of the measurement during Run 3 of the LHC and HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary nature of the nucleon scalar charge and its densities as a signal of nontrivial vacuum structure of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that the nucleon scalar charge is proportional to the pion-nucleon sigma term as one of the important low energy observables of QCD. Especially interesting to us is the physics of the nucleon scalar charge densities. This comes from the fact that the corresponding operator has the same quantum number as the physical vacuum. It indicates unusual behavior of the the nucleon scalar density as a function of the distance $r$ from the nucleon center. Namely, it would not be reduced down to zero at the spatial infinity but rather approaches some nonzero constant corresponding to the vacuum quark condensate. Naturally, this unique nature of the nucleon scalar density in the position space also affects the corresponding density in the momentum space, i.e. the corresponding parton distribution function (PDF) as a function of the Bjorken variable $x$. This PDF is known as the chiral-odd twist-3 PDF $e (x)$. We argue that $e(x)$ is likely to have a delta-function type singularity at $x=0$, and that the appearance of this singularity can be interpreted as a signal of the nontrivial vacuum structure of the QCD.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of liquid xenon in the context of light dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a description of the electronic structure of xenon within the density-functional theory formalism with the goal of accurately modeling dark matter-induced ionisation in liquid xenon detectors. We compare the calculated electronic structures of the atomic, liquid and crystalline solid phases, and find that the electronic charge density and its derivatives in momentum space are similar in the atom and the liquid, consistent with the weak interatomic van der Waals bonding. The only notable difference is a band broadening of the highest occupied $5p$ levels, reflected in the densities of states of the condensed phases, as a result of the inter-atomic interactions. We therefore use the calculated density of states of the liquid phase, combined with the standard literature approach for the isolated atom, to recompute ionisation rates and exclusion limit curves for the XENON10 and XENON1T experiments. We find that the broadening of the 5$p$ levels induced by the liquid phase is relevant only at low dark matter masses, where it increases the ionisation rate relative to that of the isolated atom. For most of the probable mass range the energies of the discrete 4$d$ and 5$s$ levels have the strongest effect on the rate. Our findings suggest a simple scheme for calculating dark matter-electron scattering rates in liquid noble gas detectors, using the calculated values for the atom weighted by the density of states of the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson precision analysis of two Higgs doublet models: Full LHC Run 1 and Run 2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results obtained by performing global fits of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) using the full Run 1 and Run 2 Higgs datasets collected at the LHC. Avoiding unwanted tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents and including the wrong-sign cases, we consider 12 scenarios across six types of 2HDMs: Inert, type I, type II, type III, type IV, and Aligned 2HDMs. Our main results are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 1. We find that the type-I 2HDM provides the best fit, while the wrong-sign scenarios of the type-II and type-IV 2HDMs, where the normalized Yukawa coupling to down-type quarks is opposite in sign to the Standard Model (SM), are disfavored. We also observe that the Aligned 2HDM gives the second-best fit when the Yukawa couplings to down-type quarks take the same sign as in the SM, regardless of the sign of the Yukawa couplings to the charged leptons.</description>

      <title>Semihard interactions at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a minijet model to examine the behavior of the total cross section, $\sigma_{tot}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $\rho$, at high energies. In this framework, the growth of $\sigma_{tot}$ in $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ channels is driven by semihard partonic processes dominated by gluon interactions. The QCD contribution to $\sigma_{tot}$ for the jet production is computed in the next-to-leading order. We analyze data separately from the TOTEM and ATLAS/ALFA Collaborations and find evidence in both cases suggesting the necessity of an odd semihard component that becomes asymptotically significant at high energies.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequalities and Quantum Correlations in $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in Higgs-boson decays $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu\bigr)$ using CMS open data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, incorporating realistic detector effects. By reconstructing the polarization density matrix of the two-boson system and evaluating the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell operator $I_3$, we quantify entanglement in the $ZZ$ state. Our analysis shows that $90.7\%$ of signal events $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^*\bigr)$ violate the Bell inequality $\bigl(I_3&gt;2\bigr)$, indicating strong quantum correlations, while only $11.8\%$ of non-resonant continuum background events $\bigl(pp \rightarrow ZZ\bigr)$ exhibit such a violation.

      <title>$\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ productions in $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we propose to investigate the productions of $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ in the $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow D^{-} D^{0} p$ process. The cross sections and differential cross sections depending on the $D^0 p$ invariant mass spectrum are estimated by utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach, where both $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ are considered as the $N D^{\ast}$ molecular states with the $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, respectively. Our estimations indicate that the total cross sections are $141.6^{-109.6}_{+207.7}~\mathrm{\mu b}$ when $p_{\pi}=15~\mathrm{GeV}$, where the uncertainties result from the variation of the cutoff parameter $\Lambda_{r}$. By comparing the contributions of the $s$, $u$, and $t$ channels, we find that the $t$ channel plays the predominant role. Moreover, the present estimations suggest that the structure around 2.9 GeV in the $D^0 p$ invariant mass spectrum of the $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow D^{-} D^{0} p$ process should correspond to $\Lambda_c(2910)$ rather than $\Lambda_c(2940)$, which can be tested by further experimental measurements at J-PARC in the future.</description>

      <title>Two-loop helicity amplitudes for diphoton production with massive quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute two-loop helicity amplitudes in QCD for diphoton production through quark- and gluon-initiated channels, accounting for a massive internal quark loop by keeping its full mass dependence. Using physical projectors, we directly decompose the amplitude into its helicity components. By renormalising the heavy quark mass in on-shell, and other quantities in $\overline{\rm MS}$ schemes, we obtain finite remainders. This work paves the way for calculating the cross-section for diphoton production at higher orders in QCD with a massive quark loop, employing different subtraction schemes. The effect of a heavy quark is expected to play a crucial role in high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exploratory study of the exclusive toponium production in $pp$, $pPb$ and $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) is performed. Assuming that the toponium is a pseudoscalar $t\bar{t}$ bound state, we consider its production by photon and gluon - induced interactions. Results for the total cross - sections and associated rapidity distributions are presented, and the observability of the toponium in exclusive processes is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic quantum nature of jets and the Quark-Gluon Plasma makes the study of jet quenching a promising candidate to benefit from quantum computing power. Standing as a precursor of the full study of this phenomenon, we study the propagation of SU(3) partons in Quark-Gluon Plasma using quantum simulation algorithms. The algorithms are developed in detail, and the propagation of both quarks and gluons is analysed and compared with analytical expectations. The results, obtained with quantum simulators, demonstrate that the algorithm successfully simulates parton propagation, yielding results consistent with analytical baseline calculations.</description>

      <title>Top-quark spin correlations as a tool to distinguish pseudoscalar $A \to ZH$ and scalar $H \to ZA$ signatures in $Z t \bar t$ final states at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both ATLAS and CMS have recently performed the first searches for a heavy new spin-0 resonance decaying into a lighter new spin-0 resonance and a $Z$ boson, where the lighter spin-0 resonance subsequently decays into $t \bar t$ pairs. These searches are of particular interest to probe Two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) parameter space regions that predict a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. In the absence of CP violation, the investigated decay is possible if the lighter and the heavier spin-0 particles have opposite CP parities. The analysis techniques employed by ATLAS and CMS do not distinguish between the two possible signatures $A \to ZH$ and $H \to ZA$, where $A$ and $H$ denote CP-odd and CP-even Higgs bosons, respectively, if both signals are predicted to have the same total cross sections. We demonstrate the capability of angular variables that are sensitive to spin correlations of the top quarks to differentiate between $A \to ZH$ and $H \to ZA$ decays, even in scenarios where both signals possess identical total cross sections. Focusing on masses of 600 GeV and 800 GeV as a representative 2HDM benchmark, we find that a distinction between the two possible channels is possible with high significance with the anticipated data from the high-luminosity LHC, if the invariant mass distribution of the $t \bar t$ system is further binned in angular variables defined by the direction of flight of the leptons produced in the top-quark decays. Moreover, we find a moderate gain in experimental sensitivity due to the improved background rejection for both signals.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest approach to constructing models with sub-dimensional particles or fractons is to require the conservation of dipole or higher multipole moments. We generalize this approach to allow for moments in phase space and classify all possible classical fracton models with phase-space multipole conservation laws. We focus on a new self-dual model that conserves both dipole and quadrupole moments in position and momentum; we analyze its dynamics and find quasi-periodic orbits in phase space that evade ergodic exploration of the full phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The path optimization method with machine learning is applied to the one-dimensional massive lattice Thirring model, which has the sign problem caused by the fermion determinant. This study aims to investigate how the path optimization method works for the sign problem. We show that the path optimization method successfully reduces statistical errors and reproduces the analytic results. We also examine an approximation of the Jacobian calculation in the learning process and show that it gives consistent results with those without an approximation.</description>

      <title>Baryon-Electric Charge Correlations and Chemical Potentials as Probes of Magnetized QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD results of quadratic fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD in the presence of a background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical pion mass $m_\pi$ = 135 MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find that the correlation between net baryon number and electric charge, denoted as $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11} $, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. At pseudocritical temperatures ($T_{pc}$) the $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ starts to increase rapidly with magnetic field strength $eB \gtrsim 2M^2_{\pi}$ and by a factor 2 at $eB\simeq 8 M^2_{\pi}$. By comparing with the hadron resonance gas model, we find that the $eB$ dependence of $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ is mainly due to the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) baryon. Although the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) could not be detected experimentally, its decay products, protons and pions, retain the $eB$ dependence of $\Delta$(1232)'s contribution to $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies with the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have carried out lattice simulations of $(2+1)$-flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quarks at the physical pion mass on $32^3 \times 8$ and $48^3 \times 12$ lattices, with magnetic field strengths ranging up to 0.8 GeV$^2$ and nonzero baryon chemical potentials employing the Taylor expansion framework. We present lattice QCD continuum estimate results, along with the magnetized hadron resonance and ideal gas comparisons, for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients for bulk thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, number density, energy density, and entropy density, focusing on the significant impact of strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>High-precision numerical evaluation of Lauricella functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions, whose indices are linearly dependent on some parameter $\varepsilon$, in terms of their Laurent series expansions at zero. This method is based on finding analytic continuations of these functions in terms of Frobenius generalized power series. Being one-dimensional, these series are much more suited for high-precision numerical evaluations than multi-dimensional sums arising in approaches to analytic continuations based on re-expansions of hypergeometric series or Mellin--Barnes integral representations. To accelerate the calculation procedure further, the $\varepsilon$ dependence of the result is reconstructed from the evaluations of given Lauricella functions at specific numerical values of $\varepsilon$, which, in addition, allows for efficient parallel implementation. The method has been implemented in the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, written in Wolfram Mathematica language.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons action in linear covariant gauges by taking into account gauge copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the effects of removing infinitesimal Gribov copies from the path integral of gauge-fixed Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories formulated in three-dimensional Euclidean space have been investigated. Part of the interest resides on the fact that such an elimination of gauge copies introduces a mass parameter, the Gribov parameter, which is relevant when the assumptions of the Faddeev-Popov procedure are not well-grounded. Such a parameter enters the propagator of the gauge field which is topologically massive due to the Chern-Simons term. The resulting action, which eliminates infinitesimal Gribov copies in this context, has been constructed in linear covariant gauges and the interplay between the aforementioned mass-parameters allows for a rich phase diagram in which confining and deconfining signatures are observed in the gauge-field propagator. In the present work, we establish the renormalization properties of such a theory at all orders in perturbation theory by means of the algebraic renormalization framework and show that the removal of infinitesimal Gribov copies does not affect the standard non-renormalization properties of standard gauge-fixed Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories, i.e., the theory is finite.</description>

      <title>The cosmic optical background intensity from decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's New Horizon observations yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity. The reported COB flux is $16.37\pm 1.47$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608~ \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 ~ \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m})$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble space telescope count, an anomalous excess flux $8.06 \pm 1.92~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. This observation could hint toward decaying dark matter producing photons. In this work, we have considered sterile neutrinos of the keV scale as well as the eV scale decaying via sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment, respectively, to explain anomalous flux. The sterile neutrinos with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B}$, and mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3.33\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$ can successfully account for the observed anomalous intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of the muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of 1 cm--thick iron tubes inside 30 cm--deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results into a dramatic improvement of the image quality, as well as into a significant reduction of the data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Ultra-light Axion Dark Matter through Galaxy Cluster Number Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light axions are hypothetical scalar particles that influence the evolution of large-scale structures of the Universe. Depending on their mass, they can potentially be part of the dark matter component of the Universe, as candidates commonly referred to as fuzzy dark matter. While strong constraints have been established for pure fuzzy dark matter models, the more general scenario where ultra-light axions constitute only a fraction of the dark matter has been limited to a few observational probes. In this work, we use the galaxy cluster number counts obtained from the first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) of the SRG/eROSITA mission together with gravitational weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam, to constrain the fraction of ultra-light axions in the mass range $10^{-32}$ eV to $10^{-24}$ eV. We put upper bounds on the ultra-light axion relic density in independent logarithmic axion mass bins by performing a full cosmological parameter inference. We find an exclusion region in the intermediate ultra-light axion mass regime with the tightest bounds reported so far in the mass bins around $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-27}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0036$ and $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0084$, both at 95% confidence level. When combining with CMB probes, these bounds are tightened to $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0030$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{27}$ eV mass bin and $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0058$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV mass bin, both at 95% confidence level. This is the first time that constraints on ultra-light axions have been obtained using the growth of structure measured by galaxy cluster number counts. These results pave the way for large surveys, which can be utilized to obtain tight constraints on the mass and relic density of ultra-light axions with better theoretical modeling of the abundance of halos.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray Burst GRB 221009A: two distinct hints at once at new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brightest ever observed gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ was detected on October 9, 2022. Its highest energy photons have been recorded by the LHAASO collaboration up to above $12 \, \rm TeV$, and one of the at ${\cal E} = 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet-2 collaboration. Very recently, the Carpet-3 collaboration has completed the data analysis, showing that the evidence of the $251 \, {\rm TeV}$ photon is quite robust. Still, according to conventional physics photons with ${\cal E} \gtrsim 10 \, \rm TeV$ cannot be observed owing to the absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Previously it has been demonstrated that an axion-like particle (ALP) with allowed parameters ensures the observability of the LHAASO photons. Here we show that the Lorentz invariance violation allows the ${\cal E} = 251 \, {\rm TeV}$ (now around 300 TeV) Carpet photon to be detected.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection of eV Dark Matter via Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range $m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,$eV ($0.5-4\,$eV) with a photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of reduction of couplings consists in the search for relations between seemingly independent couplings of a renormalizable theory that are renormalization group invariant. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of such 1-loop relations among the top Yukawa, the Higgs quartic and the gauge colour couplings of the Type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model at a high-energy boundary. The phenomenological viability of the reduced theory suggests the value of $\tan\beta$ and the scale in which new physics may appear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global fit of dark matter interactions with nucleons using a non-relativistic effective operator description, considering both direct detection and neutrino data. We examine the impact of combining the direct detection experiments CDMSlite, CRESST-II, CRESST-III, DarkSide-50, LUX, LZ, PandaX-II, PandaX-4T, PICO-60, SIMPLE, SuperCDMS, XENON100, and XENON1T along with neutrino data from IceCube and ANTARES. While current neutrino telescope data lead to increased sensitivity compared to underground nuclear scattering experiments for dark matter masses above 100 GeV, our future projections show that the next generation of underground experiments will significantly outpace solar searches for most dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering interactions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ in B decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector charmonium states can be directly produced in the $e^+e^{-}$ annihilation process. Among them, $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ splitting from the previously discovered $Y(4260)$ are not easily arranged into the conventional charmonium spectrum, while recent studies have indicated that they have strong couplings to $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$. In this work, we investigate the production of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ as the heavy-quark spin symmetry doublet hadronic molecules of $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$ in $B$ decays via the triangle diagram mechanism. In particular, we propose that the decay constants of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ extracted in $B$ decays are useful for clarifying their nature.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. Specifically, we propose to change a half-wave plate by a circular polarizer. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <title>A Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a bound on dark photon dark matter scenarios where the dark photon mass is generated through the Higgs mechanism, based on the requirement that symmetry breaking must occur sufficiently early in the universe. We emphasize that dark photon production occurs successfully when the dark Higgs field remains in the symmetric phase due to non-thermal trapping effects. For renormalizable Higgs potentials, our bound reads $$\frac{m_{\gamma'}}{q_H e_H}\;\gg \;60\,{\rm eV}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{1/4}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson, and $\lambda$ is the Higgs quartic coupling}. This constraint holds independently of any complications arising from the Schwinger effect and vortex formation in the Higgsed phase. For more general Higgs potentials such as the Coleman-Weinberg type potential, our bound yields different forms. We argue that late-time symmetry breaking of the dark U(1) symmetry satisfying our bound has only a mild impact on both the abundance and momentum distribution of dark photon dark matter, and therefore does not pose any serious problem for the dark photon dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of high-energy hadronic jets ('jet tagging') has been a critical benchmark problem for machine learning in particle physics. Jets are ubiquitous at colliders and are complex objects that serve as prototypical examples of collections of particles to be categorized. Over the last decade, machine learning-based classifiers have replaced classical observables as the state of the art in jet tagging. Increasingly complex machine learning models are leading to increasingly more effective tagger performance. Our goal is to address the question of convergence -- are we getting close to the fundamental limit on jet tagging or is there still potential for computational, statistical, and physical insights for further improvements? We address this question using state-of-the-art generative models to create a realistic, synthetic dataset with a known jet tagging optimum. Various state-of-the-art taggers are deployed on this dataset, showing that there is a significant gap between their performance and the optimum. Our dataset and software are made public to provide a benchmark task for future developments in jet tagging and other areas of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Tri-meson state $\boldsymbol{\bar{B}\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically explore the trimeson states $\bar{B}\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*$ with various isospin-spin configurations in the quark model by solving exactly the six-body Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the Gaussian expansion method. The configuration $\left[[\bar{B} \bar{B}^*]^1_0\bar{B}^*\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is not only approximately 10.2 MeV lower than the threshold of its constituent particles but also about 0.2 MeV below that of the compact tetraquark state $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$ and $\bar{B}^*$. This configuration manifests a loose two-body bound state composed of $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$ and $\bar{B}^* $, with a size of around 4.75 fm. In contrast, the configurations $\left[[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_1\bar{B}^*\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$, $\left[\bar{B}[\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*]^0_1\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$, and $\left[[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_1\bar{B}^*\right]^1_{\frac{1}{2}}$ exhibit binding energies of less than 1 MeV relative to their constituent particles, establishing a loose three-meson bound state. After coupling three configurations with $\frac{1}{2}0^-$, the trimeson state with $\frac{1}{2}0^-$ remains a loosely two-body bound state with a binding energy around 1.5 MeV and a huge size of 2.20 fm, in which the configuration $\left[[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0\bar{B}^*\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is dominant, contributing $80\%$ to the overall probability. Among the four bound configurations, the $\sigma$-meson exchange plays a decisive role. The meson pair $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$, resembling the short-range strong correlated $p$-$n$ pair in nuclear physics, prevails over other types of meson pairs. The meson pair $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$ not only contributes to the binding mechanisms but also influences the spatial structures of those stable trimeson configurations.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs), as known as align-spin (AS) functions. In the paper, we propose the most suitable proof of the AS-function existence together with the demonstration of the preponderances if the framework of twisted quark states has been employed. The twisted state corresponds to the elementary particle (quark) which possesses the nontrivial intrinsic orbital angular momentum owing to the swirling trajectory of motion. In its turn, it leads to the cylindric system applied for the consideration. In this connection, we reveal that the twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. In contrast to the previous studies, where the existence of new TMDs is related to the the corresponding interactions encoded in the correlators, we now focus on the leading order of interactions providing a simplified and robust method. This has been ensured by the twisted quark in the corresponding correlator because the essential transverse momentum dependence of quarks generated by interactions in the correlators can be alternatively described by the twisted states. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model extension with new scalar triplets and singlet (TNMSSM), we analyze the electric dipole moment (EDM) of neutron ($d_n$), electron EDM($d_e$), the mercury EDM($d_{Hg}$), $b$ quark ($d_b$) and $c$ quark ($d_c$) by considering the contributions from the one-loop diagrams, some two-loop diagrams and the Weinberg operators. The effects of TNMSSM specific CPV sources $\chi_d,\;\chi_t$ on $d_n$, $d_e$, $d_{Hg}$, $d_b$, $d_c$ are specialized, it is found that they have significant contributions to these EDMs, and the current upper bounds on $d_n$ impose strict constraints on $\chi_d,\;\chi_t$. The theoretical predictions on $d_b$, $d_c$ can reach about $10^{-22}$ e$\cdot$cm and $10^{-23}$ e$\cdot$cm respectively by taking the upper bounds on $d_n$, $d_e$, $d_{Hg}$ into account, which have great potential to be observed in future.</description>

We show how generative unfolding enables both tasks and how both benefit from unbinned,high-dimensional unfolding. Our method includes an unbiasing step with respect to the training data and promises significant advantages over standard methods, in terms of flexibility and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a proposed long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that will project an on-axis wide-band neutrino beam over a distance of 1300 km to determine the unknowns in the neutrino sector. Given the baseline of 1300 km and the intense beam facility, DUNE is a promising experiment to study the sub-leading effects such as environmental decoherence, matter induced non-standard interactions (NSIs), neutrino decay, etc. In this study, we investigate how NSI and environmental decoherence affect the neutrino oscillation probabilities simultaneously. Considering the modified probabilities we obtain the updated mass hierarchy (MH) and CP violation (CPV) sensitivities of DUNE. Furthermore, we demonstrate the sensitivity of DUNE to distinguish between the effects of NSI and environmental decoherence.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal short-distance constraints on hadronic light-by-light scattering and tensor meson contributions to the muon $g-2$</title>

Abstract: Short-distance constraints from the operator product expansion in QCD play an important role in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While conventional hadronic models involving a finite number of resonances fail to reproduce the correct power laws implied by them, holographic QCD has been shown to naturally incorporate the Melnikov-Vainshtein constraint on the longitudinal amplitude following from the triangle anomaly in the asymmetric limit, where one photon virtuality remains small compared to the others. This is saturated by an infinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the muon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive analysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance constraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the level of 81\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to the muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap, because in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only contributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint. Numerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the low-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a negligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining gap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete hadronic light-by-light contribution.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and Unitarity for Cosmological Correlators</title>

Abstract: We study the fundamentals of quantum field theory on a rigid de Sitter space. We show that the perturbative expansion of late-time correlation functions to all orders can be equivalently generated by a non-unitary Lagrangian on a Euclidean AdS geometry. This finding simplifies dramatically perturbative computations, as well as allows us to establish basic properties of these correlators, which comprise a Euclidean CFT. We use this to infer the analytic structure of the spectral density that captures the conformal partial wave expansion of a late-time four-point function, to derive an OPE expansion, and to constrain the operator spectrum. Generically, dimensions and OPE coefficients do not obey the usual CFT notion of unitarity. Instead, unitarity of the de Sitter theory manifests itself as the positivity of the spectral density. This statement does not rely on the use of Euclidean AdS Lagrangians and holds non-perturbatively. We illustrate and check these properties by explicit calculations in a scalar theory by computing first tree-level, and then full one-loop-resummed exchange diagrams. An exchanged particle appears as a resonant feature in the spectral density which can be potentially useful in experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and twin compact stars</title>

Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715 and J1231-1411, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of two-flavored spin-zero heavy dibaryons in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the ground state energy spectra of two-flavored heavy dibaryons in the spin-singlet channel. In particular, the ground state masses of $\Omega_{llQ}\Omega_{llQ}, \Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{llQ}$ and $\Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{QlQ}$ states are computed and compared with their respective lowest non-interacting energy levels, where the flavor $Q \in (c,b)$ denotes charm and bottom quarks, and the other flavor $l \in {s,c,b}$ represents strange, charm and bottom, respectively. Considering their valence quark structures, these hadrons could be thought of as the heavy flavor analogues of spin-singlet nucleon-nucleon states. The gauge configurations employed in this study are HISQ ensembles with $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors, generated by the MILC collaboration, at four lattice spacings, namely $a=0.1207, 0.0888, 0.0582$ and $0.0448$ fm. The aforementioned states are also computed at different quark masses, between $m_s \le m_l \le m_b$, including at unphysical heavy quark masses, to explore the quark mass dependence of any possible binding. For the dibaryon states $\Omega_{bbc}\Omega_{bbc}, \Omega_{ccb}\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{ccb} \Omega_{bbc}$, we find a clear evidence of an energy level below their respective non-interacting energy levels. In addition, for these dibaryons at quark masses $m_c &lt; m_l \le m_b$, a trend is found where the gap, between the lowest energy levels and the respective lowest non-interacting levels, increases as the quark mass $m_l$ increases. We also study the heavy quark spin-symmetry and its breaking for these heavy dibaryons.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by a factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simple hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor for model parameter fits and Goodness of Fit tests and composite hypothesis tests. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Predicting the spectrum and decay constants of positive-parity heavy-strange mesons using domain-wall fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the masses and decay constants of the positive-parity heavy-strange mesons $D^*_{s0}$, $D_{s1}$, $B^*_{s0}$, and $B_{s1}$. The calculations are performed with domain-wall fermions for the light and strange quarks and an anisotropic clover action for the charm and bottom quarks. We use seven different RBC/UKQCD ensembles with pion masses ranging from a near-physical 139 MeV up to 431 MeV. We consider two different analysis types, with or without two-meson operators at the source. We observe the expected below-threshold ground states. The fits without the two-meson operators appear to be more stable, but may overestimate the ground-state energies, while preliminary fits with two-meson operators at the source only appear to underestimate the ground-state energies.</description>
