      <title>Engineering unique localization transition with coupled Hatano-Nelson chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hatano-Nelson (HN) Hamiltonian has played a pivotal role in catalyzing research interest in non-Hermitian systems, primarily because it showcases unique physical phenomena that arise solely due to non-Hermiticity. The non-Hermiticity in the HN Hamiltonian, driven by asymmetric hopping amplitudes, induces a delocalization-localization (DL) transition in a one-dimensional (1D) lattice with random disorder, sharply contrasting with its Hermitian counterpart. A similar DL transition occurs in a 1D quasiperiodic HN (QHN) lattice, where a critical quasiperiodic potential strength separates metallic and insulating states, akin to the Hermitian case. In these systems, all states below the critical potential are delocalized, while those above are localized. In this study, we reveal that coupling two 1D QHN lattices can significantly alter the nature of the DL transition. We identify two critical points, $V_{c1} &lt; V_{c2}$, when the nearest neighbors of the two 1D QHN lattices are cross-coupled with strong hopping amplitudes under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Generally, all states are completely delocalized below $ V_{c1}$ and completely localized above $V_{c2}$, while two mobility edges symmetrically emerge about $\rm{Re[E]} = 0$ between $V_{c1}$ and $V_{c2}$. Notably, under specific asymmetric cross-hopping amplitudes, $V_{c1}$ approaches zero, resulting in localized states even for infinitesimally weak potential. Remarkably, we also find that the mobility edges precisely divide the delocalized and localized states in equal proportions. Furthermore, we observe that the conventional one-to-one correspondence between electronic states under PBC and open boundary conditions (OBC) in 1D HN lattices breaks</description>

      <title>Periodic systems have new classes of synchronization stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Master Stability Function is a robust and useful tool for determining the conditions of synchronization stability in a network of coupled systems. While a comprehensive classification exists in the case in which the nodes are chaotic dynamical systems, its application to periodic systems has been less explored. By studying several well-known periodic systems, we establish a comprehensive framework to understand and classify their properties of synchronizability. This allows us to define five distinct classes of synchronization stability, including some that are unique to periodic systems. Specifically, in periodic systems, the Master Stability Function vanishes at the origin, and it can therefore display behavioral classes that are not achievable in chaotic systems, where it starts, instead, at a strictly positive value. Moreover, our results challenge the widely-held belief that periodic systems are easily put in a stable synchronous state, showing, instead, the common occurrence of a lower threshold for synchronization stability.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover via confinement in the lattice Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a lattice model in which a tracer particle moves in the presence of randomly distributed immobile obstacles. The crowding effect due to the obstacles interplays with the quasi-confinement imposed by wrapping the lattice onto a cylinder. We compute the velocity autocorrelation function and show that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover from two- to one-dimensional as time progresses. A pulling force is switched on and we characterize analytically the stationary state in terms of the stationary velocity and diffusion coefficient. Stochastic simulations are used to discuss the range of validity of the analytic results. Our calculation, exact to first order in the obstacle density, holds for arbitrarily large forces and confinement size.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent dynamics in the confined lattice Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice model describing the non-equilibrium dynamics emerging from the pulling of a tracer particle through a disordered medium occupied by randomly placed obstacles. The model is considered in a restricted geometry pertinent for the investigation of confinement-induced effects. We analytically derive exact results for the characteristic function of the moments valid to first order in the obstacle density. By calculating the velocity autocorrelation function and its long-time tail we find that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover. This picture is further confirmed by the approach of the drift velocity to its terminal value attained in the non-equilibrium stationary state. At large times the diffusion coefficient is affected by both the driving and confinement in a way that we quantify analytically. The force-induced diffusion coefficient depends sensitively on the presence of confinement. The latter is able to modify qualitatively the non-analytic behavior in the force observed for the unbounded model. We then examine the fluctuations of the tracer particle along the driving force. We show that in the intermediate regime superdiffusive anomalous behavior persists even in the presence of confinement. Stochastic simulations are employed in order to test the validity of the analytic results, exact to first order in the obstacle density and valid for arbitrary force and confinement.</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Emergence of robust memory manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to store continuous variables in the state of a biological system (e.g. a neural network) is critical for many behaviours. Most models for implementing such a memory manifold require hand-crafted symmetries in the interactions or precise fine-tuning of parameters. We present a general principle that we refer to as {\it frozen stabilisation} (FS), which allows a family of neural networks to self-organise to a critical state exhibiting multiple memory manifolds without parameter fine-tuning or symmetries. Memory manifolds arising from FS exhibit a wide range of emergent relaxational timescales and can be used as general purpose integrators for inputs aligned with the manifold. Moreover, FS allows robust memory manifolds in small networks, and this is relevant to debates of implementing continuous attractors with a small number of neurons in light of recent experimental discoveries.</description>

      <title>Anomalous universal quantum transport in 2D asymptotic quasiperiodic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention. Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>The Self-Organized Criticality Paradigm in Economics &amp; Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Self-Organised Criticality'' (SOC) is the mechanism by which complex systems spontaneously settle close to a *critical point*, at the edge between stability and chaos, and characterized by fat-tailed fluctuations and long-memory correlations. Such a scenario may explain why insignificant perturbations can generate large disruptions, through the propagation of ``avalanches'' across the system. In this short review, we discuss how SOC could offer a plausible solution to the excess volatility puzzle in financial markets and the analogue ``small shocks, large business cycle puzzle'' for the economy at large, as initially surmised by Per Bak et al. in 1993. We argue that in general the quest for efficiency and the necessity of *resilience* may be mutually incompatible and require specific policy considerations.</description>
