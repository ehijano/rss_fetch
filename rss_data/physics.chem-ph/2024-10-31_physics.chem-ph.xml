      <title>Memory and Friction: From the Nanoscale to the Macroscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction is a phenomenon that manifests across all spatial and temporal scales, from the molecular to the macroscopic scale. It describes the dissipation of energy from the motion of particles or abstract reaction coordinates and arises in the transition from a detailed molecular-level description to a simplified, coarse-grained model. It has long been understood that time-dependent (non-Markovian) friction effects are critical for describing the dynamics of many systems, but that they are notoriously difficult to evaluate for complex physical, chemical, and biological systems. In recent years, the development of advanced numerical friction extraction techniques and methods to simulate the generalized Langevin equation have enabled exploration of the role of time-dependent friction across all scales. We discuss recent applications of these friction extraction techniques and the growing understanding of the role of friction in complex equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Transferability of the chemical bond-based machine learning model for dipole moment: the GHz to THz dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol and polypropylene glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a first-principles study of the dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) using a recently developed chemical bond-based machine learning (ML) model for dipole moments [T. Amano et al. Phys. Rev. B 110, 165159 (2024)]. The ML dipole models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid configurations in close agreement with DFT calculations and generate $20 \mathrm{ns}$ quantum-accuracy dipole moment trajectories to calculate the dielectric function, when combined with ML potentials. The calculated dielectric function of PG closely matches experimental results. We identified a libration peak at $600\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and an intermolecular mode at $100\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, previously noted experimentally. Furthermore, the models trained on PG2 training data can apply to longer chain PPG not included in the training data. The present research marks the first step toward developing a universal bond-based dipole model.</description>

      <title>Coupled-cluster theory for the ground state and for excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the molecular quantum chemistry community, coupled-cluster (CC) methods are well-recognized for their systematic convergence and reliability. The extension of the theory to extended systems has been comparably recent, so that developments and studies of periodic CC methods for both the ground-state and for excited states are still active fields of research and provide valuable benchmark data when the reliability of density functional approximations is questionable. In this contribution we describe the CC-aims interface between the FHI-aims and the Cc4s software packages. This linkage makes a variety of correlated wave function-based ground-state methods including M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), the random-phase approximation (RPA) and the gold-standard of quantum chemistry CCSD(T) method for both molecular and periodic applications accessible. This contribution discusses these ground-state methods for clusters and molecules, as well as for periodic systems. In particular, we discuss recent advancements and the implementation of the equation-of-motion CC method for the calculation of ionization (IP-EOM-CCSD) and electron attachment (EA-EOM-CCSD) processes. Open questions and routes to solutions are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Eliminating Phase Freedom of Nonadiabatic Couplings with the State-Intraction State-Averaged Spin-Restricted Ensemble-Referenced Kohn-Sham Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) simulations near conical intersections (CIs) pose significant challenges when using machine learning potentials (MLPs). Although MLPs have gained recognition for their integration into mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, such as trajectory surface hopping (TSH), and their capacity to model correlated electron-nuclear dynamics efficiently, difficulties persist in managing nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, singularities at CIs and double-valued coupling elements result in discontinuities that disrupt the smoothness of predictive functions. Partial solutions have been provided by learning diabatic Hamiltonians with phaseless loss functions to these challenges. However, a definitive method for addressing the discontinuities caused by CIs and double-valued coupling elements has yet to be developed. Here, we introduce the phaseless coupling term, $\Delta^2$, derived from the square of the off-diagonal elements of the diabatic Hamiltonian in the SSR(2,2) formalism. This approach improves the stability and accuracy of the MLP model by addressing the issues arising from CI singularities and double-valued coupling functions. We apply this method to the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (PSB3), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving MLP training for ML-based nonadiabatic dynamics. Our results show that the $\Delta^2$ based ML-ESMD method can reproduce ab initio ESMD simulations, underscoring its potential and efficiency for broader applications, particularly in large-scale and long-timescale ESMD simulations.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic self-assembly of neutral particles on a dielectric substrate: A theoretical study via a multiple-image method and an effective-dipole approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiple-image method is developed to accurately calculate the electrostatic interaction between neutral dielectric particles and a uniformly charged dielectric substrate. The difference in dielectric constants between the particle and the solvent medium leads to a reversal of positive and negative polarizations in the particle. The variance in dielectric constants between the solvent medium and the substrate causes a transition from attractive to repulsive forces between the particle and the substrate. A nonuniform electrostatic field is generated by the polarized charges on the substrate due to mutual induction. These characteristics of electrostatic manipulation determine whether particles are adsorbed onto the substrate or pushed away from it. The self-assembled particles tend to aggregate in a stable hexagonal structure on the substrate. These findings provide new insights into self-assembly processes involving neutral particles on a dielectric substrate.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic modelling of bio-compatible PLGA polymers with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A challenging topic in materials engineering is the development of numerical models that can accurately predict material properties with atomistic accuracy, matching the scale and level of detail achieved by experiments. In this regard, coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a popular method for achieving this goal. Despite the efforts of the scientific community, a reliable CG model with quasi-atomistic accuracy has not yet been proposed for the design and prototyping of materials, especially polymers. In this paper we describe a CG model for polymers, focusing on the bio-compatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), based on a general parametrization strategy with a potentially broader field of applications. In this model, polymers are represented with finite-size ellipsoids, short-range interactions are accounted for with the generalized Gay-Berne potential, while electrostatic and long-range interactions are accounted for with point charges within the ellipsoids. The model was validated against its atomistic counterpart, obtained through a back-mapping process, by comparing physical properties such as glass transition temperature, thermal conductivity, and elastic moduli. We observed quantitative agreement between the atomistic and CG representations, thus opening up the possibility of adopting the proposed model to expand the domain size of typical MD simulations to dimensions comparable to those of experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) using a quadratic zeroth-order Hamiltonian is a cornerstone of many \emph{ab initio} computational methods for molecules and materials. However, this perturbation expansion can break down in the presence of strong electron correlation, which occurs in many scenarios such as the bond dissociation of molecules in chemical reactions. In this work, we developed a generalized (time-dependent) MBPT for computing electron correlation energies, in which the zeroth-order Hamiltonian can be interacting and hence the zeroth-order reference state is a multi-determinant wavefunction instead of a single Slater determinant in general. This allows us to take strong correlation into account from the outset and treat the residual weak interaction by diagrammatic perturbation expansion. Using this framework, we formulated a multi-reference (MR) generalization of the standard single-reference (SR) random phase approximation (RPA) for the electron correlation energy by resumming generalized ring diagrams including cumulant contributions, which naturally leads to a set of unified equations that work in both SR and MR cases. To further include exchange effects, we also derived a multi-reference second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction from a coupled-cluster perspective of the resulting MR-RPA. Applications to prototypical molecules demonstrate that MR-RPA/SOSEX successfully resolves the well-known failure of the conventional SR-RPA/SOSEX for molecular dissociation. Our work bridges MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theory in quantum chemistry, opening up new possibilities for advancing computational methods for the electron correlation energy via diagrammatic resummation.</description>

      <title>Shedding a Light on the Kinetics of the Carboxysulfitic Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way in which we can attempt to relate chemical pathways to geochemical environments is by studying the kinetics of a given sequence of reactions and identifying the conditions under which this chemistry is the most productive. Many prebiotic reactions rely on a source of fixed carbon, therefore chemical pathways that suggest prebiotically plausible ways of fixing carbon are of significant interest. One such pathway is the carboxysulfitic reaction network which uses solvated electrons, produced as a result of electron photodetachment from sulfite, to reduce carbon. In this work we explore carboxysulfitic chemistry at three different pH values: 6, 9, and 12. We utilise a new light source, that matches the broadband spectral shape of the young Sun, to irradiate a mixture of bicarbonate and sulfite. We determine the rate equation for the production of formate from these compounds and find the order to be 0.71 $\pm$ 0.12 with respect to bicarbonate and -0.60 $\pm$ 0.10 with respect to sulfite. Following this, we determine rate constants for the production of formate considering two different mechanisms. We find this chemistry to be feasible at all three of the pH values tested, with the magnitude of the rate constants being highly dependent on the assumed mechanism. We suggest that these results may have implications for Mars Sample Return owing to Jezero Crater having had lakes similar to those in which we propose carboxysulfitic chemistry to have been the most productive. Due to Mars' relatively unaltered surface, we propose that Mars Sample Return missions could look for preserved tracers of this chemistry, shedding light on Mars' past conditions and its potential for having hosted life.</description>

      <title>Why does the $GW$ approximation give accurate quasiparticle energies? The cancellation of vertex corrections quantified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hedin's $GW$ approximation to the electronic self-energy has been impressively successful to calculate quasiparticle energies, such as ionization potentials, electron affinities, or electronic band structures. The success of this fairly simple approximation has been ascribed to the cancellation of the so-called vertex corrections that go beyond $GW$. This claim is mostly based on past calculations using vertex corrections within the crude local-density approximation. Here, we explore a wide variety of non-local vertex corrections in the polarizability and the self-energy, using first-order approximations or infinite summations to all orders. In particular, we use vertices based on statically screened interactions like in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We demonstrate on realistic molecular systems that the two vertices in Hedin's equation essentially compensate. We further show that consistency between the two vertices is crucial to obtain realistic electronic properties. We finally consider increasingly large clusters and extrapolate that our conclusions would hold for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Molecular Ground-State Conformation via Conformation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting ground-state conformation from the corresponding molecular graph is crucial for many chemical applications, such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, and molecular property prediction. Recently, many learning-based methods have been proposed to replace time-consuming simulations for this task. However, these methods are often inefficient and sub-optimal as they merely rely on molecular graph information to make predictions from scratch. In this work, considering that molecular low-quality conformations are readily available, we propose a novel framework called ConfOpt to predict molecular ground-state conformation from the perspective of conformation optimization. Specifically, ConfOpt takes the molecular graph and corresponding low-quality 3D conformation as inputs, and then derives the ground-state conformation by iteratively optimizing the low-quality conformation under the guidance of the molecular graph. During training, ConfOpt concurrently optimizes the predicted atomic 3D coordinates and the corresponding interatomic distances, resulting in a strong predictive model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConfOpt significantly outperforms existing methods, thus providing a new paradigm for efficiently and accurately predicting molecular ground-state conformation.</description>
