      <title>Monistic reduction of Einstein's Equation for self-gravitating field masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divergence of relativistic accelerations generates field masses and the corresponding Ricci scalar in the gravitational integral of the Hilbert action. The covariant description of the elastic hierarchy with a specific time flow and Euclidean 3-section in the pseudo-Riemannian manifold is based on the monistic analogue of the Einstein Equation for a field mass with nonlocal inertia and self-gravity. The elastic autodynamics of metrically correlated densities correspond to Bianchi vector identities for material fields of continuous masses. The local time invariant generates a primary reason for scalar mass densities and their local self-acceleration in a nonlocal hierarchy, rather than distant gravitational forces in the dualistic theory of pairwise interactions. Time should be studied experimentally as the (yin) inhomogeneous substance behind the (yang) observable densities of monistic matterspace with elastic hierarchies of nonlocal masses and their slow inelastic exchange.</description>

      <title>The missing elements in the telegraph equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional modeling of transmission lines relies on the classical telegraph equations, originally formulated over 150 years ago. These equations are typically derived by representing the line as an assembly of infinitesimal inductive, capacitive, and resistive elements. However, this formulation is fundamentally flawed, as a transmission line cannot be accurately described through a discretized model of infinitesimal lumped components. Instead, a more rigorous approach should derive the governing equations directly from Maxwells equations in conjunction with Ohms law. This paper presents such a derivation and introduces a corrected formulation, herein referred to as the Trump Equations.</description>

      <title>The weak equivalence principle and the Dirac constant: A result from the holographic principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, based on a recent formularization of the holographic principle proposed and investigated by the present author, we show that the weak equivalence principle in general relativity is equivalent to the equivalence between two forms of the Dirac constant, that is, the action of the spin degree of freedom in the two-dimensional Hilbert space and the lower bound in the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. This result follows from an equation between the Euclidean and Lorentzian world-line actions of a massive particle divided by the Dirac constant, via the Wick rotation, by using the Euclidean and Lorentzian actions of a holographic tensor network, whose quantum state is classicalized by introducing the superselection rule.</description>

      <title>Progress in evaluating a possible electromagnetic interaction energy in a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorentz-Poincar\'e interpretation of special relativity (SR) keeps the classical concepts of separated space and time, at the price of postulating an indetectable preferred inertial frame or ``ether". But SR does not contain gravity. The presence of gravity could make the ether detectable. This is one idea behind the ``scalar ether theory of gravitation" (SET), which coincides with SR if the gravity field vanishes, and passes a number of tests. However, the coupling of SET with the Maxwell electromagnetic (EM) field needs to use the theory's dynamical equation for the energy tensor in a non-trivial way. It cannot be assumed that the energy tensors of the charged matter and the EM field add to give the total energy tensor, source of the gravitational field. Thus, an additional, ``interaction" energy tensor ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ has to be postulated. Asking that ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ is Lorentz-invariant in the situation of SR, fixes its form. It depends only on a scalar field $p$. ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ is an exotic kind of matter and is distributed in the whole space, hence it could contribute to dark matter. For a weak gravitational field, $p$ obeys a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) involving the EM field and the Newtonian potential. However, the EM field varies on the scale of the wavelength, which is extremely small. To get the field $p$ in a galaxy, some averaging has to be done. After several attempts based on the homogenization theory, a simpler way has been found recently: If the macro-averages of $p$ and the EM field vary smoothly, it can be shown that the PDE for $p$ remains valid in the same form with spacetime-averaged fields. The current stage of calculations will also been shown.</description>
