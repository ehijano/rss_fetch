      <title>Dynamics of small, constant size particles in a protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disk dynamics are useful tools for understanding the formation of planetary systems, including our own. Approximations are necessary to make these simulations computationally tractable. A common assumption when simulating dust fluids is that of a constant Stokes number, a dimensionless number that characterizes the interaction between a particle and the surrounding gas. Constant Stokes number is not a good approximation in regions of the disk where the gas density changes significantly, such as near a planet-induced gap. In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant Stokes number in the popular FARGO3D code using semi-analytic equations for the drag force on dust particles, which enables an assumption of constant particle size instead. We explore the effect this change has on disk morphology and particle fluxes across the gap for both outward- and inward-drifting particles. The assumption of constant particle size, rather than constant Stokes number, is shown to make a significant difference in some cases, emphasizing the importance of the more accurate treatment.</description>

      <title>Carving the Edges of the Rocky Planet Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period planets provide ideal laboratories for testing star-planet interaction. Planets that are smaller than $\sim$2$R_\oplus$ are considered to be largely rocky either having been stripped of or never having acquired the gaseous envelope. Zooming in on these short-period rocky planet population, clear edges appear in the mass-period and radius-period space. Over $\sim$0.2--20 days and 0.09--1.42$M_\odot$, the maximum mass of the rocky planets stay below $\sim$10$M_\oplus$ with a hint of decrease towards $\lesssim$1 day, $\gtrsim$4 day, and $\lesssim 0.45 M_\odot$. In radius-period space, there is a relative deficit of $\lesssim$2$R_\oplus$ planets inside $\sim$1 day. We demonstrate how the edges in the mass-period space can be explained by a combination of tidal decay and photoevaporation whereas the rocky planet desert in the radius-period space is a signature of magnetic drag on the planet as it orbits within the stellar magnetic field. Currently observed catastrophically evaporating planets may have started their death spiral from $\sim$1 day with planets of mass up to $\sim$0.3$M_\oplus$ under the magnetic drag. More discoveries and characterization of small planets around mid-late M and A stars would be welcome to better constrain the stellar parameters critical in shaping the edges of rocky planet population including their UV radiation history, tidal and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>A closer look at LTT 9779b: The ESPRESSO endeavour to pierce the atmospheric veil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17272v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of exoplanet discoveries in exotic environments like the Neptune desert challenges our understanding of planetary atmospheres under intense irradiation. The unexpected discovery of LTT9779 b, an ultra-hot Neptune within this desert, offers a prime opportunity for atmospheric studies. We build on prior observations of LTT9779 b from TESS, Spitzer, and CHEOPS, incorporating new VLT/ESPRESSO data to probe its atmospheric dynamics. Preliminary analyses suggest a metal-rich atmosphere and a high day-side geometric albedo, possibly indicating silicate clouds. Minimal atmospheric escape is observed, contrasting existing models of planetary evolution under extreme irradiation. We obtained the transmission spectrum of LTT9779 b between 0.4 and 0.78 microns with ESPRESSO, addressing systematics across three transits. Our analysis focused on the sodium doublet and H-alpha, using cross-correlation with models containing Na, K, FeH, TiO, and VO. No significant atmospheric signal was detected, with metallicity limits set at [Fe/H] $\geq$ 2.25 ($\geq$ 180 times solar). The non-detection aligns with a high-metallicity, cloud-free model, implying a high mean molecular weight and reduced atmospheric scale height. We interpret this as evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere with suppressed spectral features, possibly due to high-altitude clouds or hazes. These findings are consistent with JWST observations, supporting the hypothesis of metal-rich atmospheres obscured by aerosols in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Carving Out the Inner Edge of the Period Ratio Distribution through Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of orbital period ratios between adjacent observed exoplanets is approximately uniform, but exhibits a strong falloff toward close orbital separations. We show that this falloff can be explained through past dynamical instabilities carving out the period ratio distribution. Our suite of numerical experiments would have required $\sim 3$ million CPU-hours through direct N-body integrations, but was achieved with only $\approx 50$ CPU-hours by removing unstable configurations using the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) machine learning model. This highlights the role of dynamical instabilities in shaping the observed exoplanet population, and shows that the inner part of the period ratio distribution provides a valuable observational anchor on the giant impact phase of planet formation.</description>

      <title>The growth of super-large pre-planetary pebbles to an impact erosion limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is dominated by sticking collisions. However, this initial phase of particle growth faces constraints - notably from destructive encounters. To find the maximum particle size achievable, we studied collisional processes during a prolonged microgravity experiment aboard a suborbital flight. Here, we specifically report an impact erosion limit. We observed individual basalt beads, each measuring 0.5 mm in diameter, colliding with and either eroding or adhering to a cluster several centimeters in size. This cluster, formed from tribocharged particles, simulates an electrostatic growth phase that surpasses the classical bouncing barrier. We find a threshold velocity of about 0.5 m/s, distinguishing between additive and erosive impacts of individual beads. Numerical simulations of grain impacts into clusters, testing both low and high charge constituents corroborate the experimental findings of surface erosion within the observed velocity range. This specific velocity threshold suggests the potential formation of pebbles several centimeters in size within protoplanetary disks. Such dimensions place these pebbles well into a regime where hydrodynamic interaction might facilitate the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>The current cratering rate on the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to compute the impact rates for objects with a diameter of 1 km onto the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus using our latest dynamical simulations of the evolution of outer solar system coupled with the best estimates of the current population of objects beyond Neptune and their size-frequency distribution. We use the outcome of the last 3.5~Gyr of evolution of the outer solar system from our database of simulations and combine this with observational constraints of the population beyond Neptune to compute the flux of objects entering the Centaur region, with uncertainties. The initial conditions resemble the current population rather than a near-circular, near-planar disc usually assumed just before the onset of giant planet migration. We obtain a better estimate of the impact probability of a Centaur with the satellites from enacting simulations of planetesimals flying past the satellites on hyperbolic orbits, which agree with literature precedents. We find that our impact rate of objects greater than 1 km in diameter with Jupiter is 0.0012/yr, which is a factor of 3--6 lower than previous estimates of 0.0044/yr from Nesvorny et al. (2023) and 0.0075/yr from Zahnle et al. (2003). On the other hand our impact probabilities with the satellites scaled to the giant planets are consistent with these earlier literature estimates, as is the leakage rate of objects from beyond Neptune into the Centaur region. However, our absolute impact probabilities with the giant planets are lower. We attribute this to our choice of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The role of cloud particle properties on WASP-39b transmission spectrum based on JWST/NIRSpec observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols are capable of having a huge influence on reflected, emitted and transmitted planetary spectra. The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) using the PRISM mode on board of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is providing valuable data of transit spectra over a wide spectral range that is able to cover the whole contribution of aerosols, potentially disentangling them from other constituents and thus allowing to constrain their properties. We aim to investigate whether NIRSpec/PRISM JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, in addition to being useful to detect and determine the abundance of gases more accurately than any previous instruments, are also capable of studying the physical properties of the aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. We perform nested sampling Bayesian retrievals with MultiNest library. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the Modelled Optical Properties of enSeMbles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) database as tools for the forward simulations and NIRSpec/PRISM JWST previously published observations of WASP-39b as input data. Retrievals indicate that models including an aerosol extinction weakly increasing or sharply decreasing with wavelength are decisively better than those with a flat transmission and that this increased degree of complexity is supported by the kind of data that JWST/NIRSpec can provide. Given other physical constraints from previous works, the scenario of weakly increasing particle extinction is favoured. We also find that this also has an effect on the retrieved gas abundances. JWST observations have the potential to study some physical characteristics of exoplanetary clouds, in particular their overall dependence of transmissivity with wavelength. In fact, it is important to implement more detailed aerosol models as their extinction may affect significantly retrieved molecular abundances.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal formation in a pressure bump induced by infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infall of interstellar material is a potential non-planetary origin of pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks. While pressure bumps arising from other mechanisms have been numerically demonstrated to promote planet formation, the impact of infall-induced pressure bumps remains unexplored. We aim to investigate the potential for planetesimal formation in an infall-induced pressure bump, starting with sub-micrometer-sized dust grains, and to identify the conditions most conducive to triggering this process. We developed a numerical model that integrates axisymmetric infall, dust drift, and dust coagulation, along with planetesimal formation via streaming instability. Our parameter space includes gas viscosity, dust fragmentation velocity, initial disk mass, characteristic disk radius, infall rate and duration, as well as the location and width of the infall region. An infall-induced pressure bump can trap dust from both the infalling material and the outer disk, promoting dust growth. The locally enhanced dust-to-gas ratio triggers streaming instability, forming a planetesimal belt inside the central infall location until the pressure bump is smoothed out by viscous gas diffusion. Planetesimal formation is favored by a massive, narrow streamer infalling onto a low-viscosity, low-mass, and spatially extended disk containing dust with a high fragmentation velocity. This configuration enhances the outward drift speed of dust on the inner side of the pressure bump, while also ensuring the prolonged persistence of the pressure bump. Planetesimal formation can occur even if the infalling material consists solely of gas. A pressure bump induced by infall is a favorable site for dust growth and planetesimal formation, and this mechanism does not require a preexisting massive planet to create the bump.</description>

      <title>The refractory-to-ice ratio in comet 67P: implications on the composition of the comet-forming region of the protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets, asteroids, and other small bodies are thought to be remnants of the original planetesimal population of the Solar System. As such, their physical, chemical, and isotopic properties hold crucial details on how and where they formed and how they evolved. Yet, placing precise constraints on the formation region of these bodies has been challenging. Data from spacecraft missions have a particularly high potential of addressing the question of the origin of the visited bodies. ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko returned data from the comet for two years on its journey around the Sun. This extensive data set has revolutionised our view on comets and still holds unsolved problems. We use the Rosetta/ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) measurement of the volatile/ice composition and the Rosetta/COSIMA (COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyzer) measurements of the refractory composition of comet 67P. These measurements are combined using a Monte Carlo method. The refractory-to-ice ratio is a free parameter that is constrained a posteriori.
  Using only the composition, we constrain the refractory-to-ice ratio to $0.5&lt;\chi&lt;1.7$, and derive the bulk elemental abundances for 67P of H, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, S, K, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Kr, and Xe. We find the noble gas xenon in near solar elemental abundance in comet 67P. Krypton is slightly depleted, while argon is heavily depleted. Comet 67P is enriched in all three noble gases by up to 2.5 orders of magnitude compared to CI chondrites. We show this is consistent with a formation region between 25 and 35 au in a protoplanetary disk region with temperatures between 30 and 40 K and with the trapping of dust for a long time in rings of the protoplanetary disk.</description>

      <title>A Heliocentric-orbiting Objects Processing System (HOPS) for the Wide Field Survey Telescope: Architecture, Processing Workflow, and Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-field surveys have markedly enhanced the discovery and study of solar system objects (SSOs). The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) represents the foremost facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the northern hemisphere. To fully exploit WFST's capabilities for SSO detection, we have developed a heliocentric-orbiting objects processing system (HOPS) tailored for identifying these objects. This system integrates HelioLinC3D, an algorithm well suited for the WFST survey cadence, characterized by revisiting the same sky field twice on the majority of nights. In this paper, we outline the architecture and processing flow of our SSO processing system. The application of the system to the WFST pilot survey data collected between March and May 2024 demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of both temporal efficiency and completeness. A total of 658,489 observations encompassing 38,520 known asteroids have been documented, and 241 newly discovered asteroids have been assigned provisional designations. In particular, 27% of these new discoveries were achieved using merely two observations per night on three nights. The preliminary results not only illuminate the effectiveness of integrating HelioLinC3D within the SSO processing system, but also emphasize the considerable potential contributions of WFST to the field of solar system science.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: GMT and ELT Direct Imaging and High-Resolution Spectroscopy Assessment $\unicode{x2013}$ Surveying Exo-Earth O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ and Testing the Habitable Zone Oxygen Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exo-Earth candidates (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Assuming continued improvement in instruments and data processing, our analysis highlights the best-case scenarios. Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels could be probed on up to $\sim$7 and $\sim$19 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a hypothetical 10-year survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, could be probed for O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ within about one week of observations on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ within a 10-year survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either $\sim$1/2 of the EECs to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $\sim$1/3 if $\eta_{\oplus}$ is large. A northern hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), would expand the target star pool by about 25%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>

Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>

Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>
