      <title>Unemployment Benefits and Job Quality: Unveiling the Complexities of Labour Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of unemployment benefits on employment quality, job stability, and tenure within complex labour market dynamics. Given the macroeconomic consequences of changes in unemployment benefits, including their impact on employment rates and output growth, we develop a closed macroeconomic model that integrates heterogeneous households and adaptive firms and incorporates real-world entry-exit market mechanisms. The model considers personal values, social norms, and social network formation among workers as we examine the role of social contacts in mediating the effects of unemployment benefits on job-matching quality and labour market outcomes. We simulate the model across various scenarios where unemployment benefit schemes differ in level and/or duration. Our results suggest that extending the duration of unemployment benefits does not necessarily improve job-matching quality. Longer benefits may indeed reduce the effectiveness of social networks in job finding, indicating that social contacts play a key role in labour market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Close to Home: Analyzing Urban Consumer Behavior and Consumption Space in Seoul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how the relatedness density of amenities influences consumer buying patterns, focusing on multi-purpose shopping preferences. Using Seoul's credit card data from 2018 to 2023, we find a clear preference for shopping at amenities close to consumers' residences, particularly for trips within a 2 km radius, where relatedness density significantly influences purchasing decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic initially reduced this effect at shorter distances but rebounded in 2023, suggesting a resilient return to pre-pandemic patterns, which vary over regions. Our findings highlight the resilience of local shopping preferences despite economic disruptions, underscoring the importance of amenity-relatedness in urban consumer behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Mismatch in Labor Markets via Public Employment Security Offices in Japan, 1972-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine changes in matching efficiency and elasticities in Japan's labor market via Hello Work for unemployed workers from January 1972 to April 2024 using a nonparametric identification approach by Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). I find a declining trend in matching efficiency, consistent with decreasing job and worker finding rates. The implied match elasticity with respect to unemployment is 0.5-0.9, whereas the implied match elasticity with respect to vacancies is 0.1-0.4. Decomposing aggregate data into full-time and part-time ones, I find that the sharp decline of matching efficiency after 2015 shown in the aggregate trend is driven by the decline of both full-time and part-time ones. Second, I extend the mismatch index proposed by Sahin et al (2014) to the nonparametric version and develop the computational methodology. I find that the mismatch across job categories is more severe than across prefectures and the original Cobb-Douglas mismatch index is underestimated.</description>

      <title>Legal Aspects of Decentralized and Platform-Driven Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharing economy is sprawling across almost every sector and activity around the world. About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform driven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. Access over ownership is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are also changing the rules of the game. One of such technologies challenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework concerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies. The chapter argues for a more forward-thinking and flexible regulatory structure.</description>

      <title>The spatial evolution of economic activities: from theory to estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the evolution of economic activities using a continuous time-space aggregation-diffusion model, which encompasses competing effects of agglomeration and congestion. To bring the model to the real data, a novel discretization technique over time and space is introduced. This technique effectively disentangles spatial effects into pure topography, agglomeration, repulsion, and diffusion forces, which is crucial for developing robust econometric methods in spatial economics. Our empirical analysis of personal income across Italian municipalities from 2008 to 2019 validates the model's primary predictions and demonstrates superior performance compared to the most common spatial econometric models in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Oxford Olympics Study 2024: Are Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games Coming Down?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is an update of the "Oxford Olympics Study 2016" (Flyvbjerg et al. 2016). We document that the Games remain costly and continue to have large cost overruns, to a degree that threatens their viability. The IOC is aware of the problem and has initiated reform. We assess the reforms and find: (a) Olympic costs are statistically significantly increasing; prior analysis did not show this trend; it is a step in the wrong direction. (b) Cost overruns were decreasing until 2008, but have increased since then; again a step in the wrong direction. (c) At present, the cost of Paris 2024 is USD 8.7 billion (2022 level) and cost overruns is 115% in real terms; this is not the cheap Games that were promised. (d) Cost overruns are the norm for the Games, past, present, and future; they are the only project type that never delivered on budget. We assess a new IOC policy of reducing cost by reusing existing venues instead of building new ones. We find that reuse did not have the desired effect for Tokyo 2020 and also look ineffective for Paris 2024. Finally, we recommend that the Games look to other types of megaprojects for better data, better forecasting, and how to generate the positive learning curves that are necessary for bringing costs and overrun down. Only if this happens are Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032 likely to live up to the IOC's intentions of a more affordable Games that more cities will want to host.</description>
