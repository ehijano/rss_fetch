      <title>HST SHEL: Enabling Comparative Exoplanetology with HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been our most prolific tool to study exoplanet atmospheres. As the age of JWST begins, there is a wealth of HST archival data that is useful to strengthen our inferences from JWST. Notably, HST/STIS and its 0.3-1 $\mu$m wavelength coverage extends past JWST's 0.6 $\mu$m wavelength cutoff and holds an abundance of potential information: alkali (Na, K) and molecular (TiO, VO) species opacities, aerosol information, and the presence of stellar contamination. However, time series observations with HST suffer from significant instrumental systematics and can be highly dependent on choices made during the transit fitting process. This makes comparing transmission spectra of planets with different data reduction methodologies challenging, as it is difficult to discern if an observed trend is caused by differences in data reduction or underlying physical processes. Here, we present the Sculpting Hubble's Exoplanet Legacy (SHEL) program, which aims to build a consistent data reduction and light curve analysis methodology and associated database of transmission spectra from archival HST observations. In this paper, we present the SHEL analysis framework for HST/STIS and its low-resolution spectroscopy modes, G430L and G750L. We apply our methodology to four notable hot Jupiters: WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-17 b, and use these examples to discuss nuances behind analysis with HST/STIS. Our results for WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, and WASP-17 b are consistent with past publications, but our analysis of WASP-69 b differs and shows evidence of either a strong scattering slope or stellar contamination. The data reduction pipeline and tutorials are available on Github.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for secular descents in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit's eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit's pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption. We present an analytical approximation in the test particle limit to describe the step-wise eccentricity evolution of the inner orbit. We also integrate the equations of motion and present approximations in both the test particle limit and in the general case to describe the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The analytical approximations are compared to numerical simulations to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Kamo`oalewa's journey from the lunar Giordano Bruno crater to Earth 1:1 resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the nearly 30,000 known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), only tens of them possess Earth co-orbital characteristics with semi-major axes $\sim$1 au. In particular, 469219 Kamo`oalewa (2016 HO3), upcoming target of China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sampling mission, exhibits a meta-stable 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth. Intriguingly, recent ground-based observations show that Kamo`oalewa has spectroscopic characteristics similar to space-weathered lunar silicates, hinting at a lunar origin instead of an asteroidal one like the vast majority of NEAs. Here we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that Kamo`oalewa's physical and orbital properties are compatible with a fragment from a crater larger than 10--20 km formed on the Moon in the last few million years. The impact could have ejected sufficiently large fragments into heliocentric orbits, some of which could be transferred to Earth 1:1 resonance and persist today. This leads us to suggest the young lunar crater Giordano Bruno (22 km diameter, 1--10 Ma age) as the most likely source, linking a specific asteroid in space to its source crater on the Moon. The hypothesis will be tested by the Tianwen-2 mission when it returns a sample of Kamo`oalewa. And the upcoming NEO Surveyor mission will possibly help us to identify such a lunar-derived NEA population.</description>

      <title>Isotopic variation of non-carbonaceous meteorites caused by dust leakage across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision isotopic measurements of meteorites revealed that they are classified into non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites. One plausible scenario for achieving this grouping is the early formation of Jupiter because massive planets can create gaps that suppress the mixing of dust across the gap in protoplanetary disks. However, the efficiency of this suppression by the gaps depends on dust size and the strength of turbulent diffusion, allowing some fraction of the dust particles to leak across the Jovian gap. In this study, we investigate how isotopic ratios of NC and CC meteorites are varied by the dust leaking across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula. To do this, we constructed a model to simulate the evolution of the dust size distribution and the $^{54}$Cr-isotopic anomaly $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr in isotopically heterogeneous disks with Jupiter. Assuming that the parent bodies of NC and CC meteorites are formed in two dust-concentrated locations inside and outside Jupiter's orbit, referred to as the NC reservoir and CC reservoir, we derive the temporal variation of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC and CC reservoir. Our results indicate that substantial contamination of CC materials occurs at the NC reservoir in the fiducial run. Nevertheless, the values of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC reservoir and the CC reservoir in the run are still consistent with those of NC and CC meteorites formed around 2 Myrs after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions. Moreover, this dust leakage causes a positive correlation between the $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr value of NC meteorites and the accretion ages of their parent bodies.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Fitting Eclipse Maps of Exoplanets with Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cooling on Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are \textit{not} susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast or very slow cooling has little effect on wave dynamics: in the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow limit wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in non-isothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially causing low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Venus as an Exoplanet: I. An Initial Exploration of the 3-D Energy Balance for a CO$_{2}$ Exoplanetary Atmosphere Around an M-Dwarf Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of an exoplanetary Venus-like atmosphere is dependent upon the ultraviolet to near ultraviolet (FUV-NUV) radiation ratio from the parent star, the balance between CO$_{2}$ photolysis and recombination via reactions that depend on the water abundance, and various catalytic chemical cycles. In this study, we use a three-dimensional (3-D) model to simulate conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper atmosphere (&lt;40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at &lt; 10$^{-5}$ mbar. More specifically, CO$_{2}$ 15-${\mu}$m cooling balances EUV/UV and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10$^{-7}$ mbar pressure with a strong maximum balance for pressures at ~10$^{-5}$ mbar, thus explaining the invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10$^{-5}$mbar pressure for all cases. Our model comparisons also show that moderate changes in NIR heating result in relatively small changes in neutral temperature in the upper atmosphere, and virtually no change in the middle atmosphere. However, with larger changes in the NIR heating profile, much greater changes in neutral temperature occur in the entire upper and middle atmosphere studied.</description>

      <title>The Hot Jupiter Radius Anomaly and Stellar Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely close proximity of hot Jupiters to their parent stars has dramatically affected both their atmospheres and interiors, inflating them to up to twice the radius of Jupiter. The physical mechanism responsible for this inflation remains unknown, though many proposals have been put forward. I will review the known hot Jupiter population, the proposed inflation mechanisms, and the evidence for and against them collected thus far. In doing so, I will cover the ways that hot Jupiter interiors may be simulated computationally in detail, and present some useful formulas for estimating their radii, heating, intrinsic temperature, and tentative magnetic field strength. I will also cover the related issues of hot Jupiter intrinsic temperatures and radiative-convective boundaries, the potential connection with planetary magnetic fields, and the effects of stellar tides on the planet. Finally, I conclude with the suggestion that more than one mechanism may be operating in concert with each other and propose various avenues for future progress in understanding these objects.</description>
