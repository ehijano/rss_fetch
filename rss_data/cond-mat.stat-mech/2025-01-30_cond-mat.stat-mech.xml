      <title>On the first positive position of a random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the first positive position reached by a random walker starting from the origin is fundamental for understanding the statistics of extremes and records in one-dimensional random walks. We present a comprehensive study of this distribution, focusing particularly on its moments and asymptotic tail behaviour, in the case where the step distribution is continuous and symmetric, encompassing both diffusive random walks and L\'evy flights.</description>

      <title>Describing Self-organized Criticality as a continuous phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the concept of self-organized criticality, exemplified by models such as the sandpile model,
  be described within the framework of continuous phase transitions? In this paper, we provide extensive
  numerical evidence supporting an affirmative answer. Specifically, we explore the BTW and Manna sandpile
  models as instances of percolation transitions from disordered to ordered phases. To facilitate this
  analysis, we introduce the concept of drop density, a continuously adjustable control variable that
  quantifies the average number of particles added to a site. By tuning this variable, we observe a
  transition in the sandpile from a sub-critical to a critical phase. Additionally, we define the scaled size
  of the largest avalanche occurring from the beginning of the sandpile as the order parameter for the
  self-organized critical transition and analyze its scaling behavior. Furthermore, we calculate the
  correlation length exponent and note its divergence as the critical point is approached. The finite
  size scaling analysis of the avalanche size distribution works quite well at the critical point of the
  BTW sandpile.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning study of phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Euclidean gravity is hot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Bacterial dimensions sensitively regulate surface diffusivity and residence time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble is a common but vital strategy that bacteria employ to explore environment suffused with boundaries, as well as to escape from entrapment. In this study we reveal how this strategy and the resulting dynamical behavior can be sensitively regulated by bacterial dimensions. Our results demonstrate that the logarithm of the surface residence time for bacteria with constant tumble bias is linearly related to a dimensionless parameter of bacterial intrinsic size characteristics, where a small variation in bacterial dimensions, which is natural in a suspension, reproduces well the experimentally observed large variation in bacterial residence time. Furthermore, our results predict that the optimal tumble bias corresponding to the maximum surface diffusivity depends strongly on bacterial dimensions, where the same small variation in bacterial dimensions gives rise to a strongly diversified optimal tumble bias and an order of magnitude change in surface diffusivity.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body system exhibits nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced phase transition in a quantum Ising model by periodic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions are often studied in random quantum circuits, with local measurements performed with a certain probability. We present here a model where a global measurement is performed with certainty at every time-step of the measurement protocol. Each time step, therefore, consists of evolution under the transverse Ising Hamiltonian for a time $\tau$, followed by a measurement that provides a ``yes/no'' answer to the question, ``Are all spins up?''. The survival probability after $n$ time-steps is defined as the probability that the answer is ``no'' in all the $n$ time-steps. For various $\tau$ values, we compute the survival probability, entanglement in bipartition, and the generalized geometric measure, a genuine multiparty entanglement, for a chain of size $L \sim 26$, and identify a transition at $\tau_c \sim 0.2$ for field strength $h=1/2$. We then analytically derive a recursion relation that enables us to calculate the survival probability for system sizes up to 1000, which provides evidence of a scaling $\tau_c \sim 1/\sqrt{L}$. The transition at finite \(\tau_c\) for \(L \sim 28\) seems therefore to recede to \(\tau_c = 0\) in the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, at large time-steps, survival probability decays logarithmically only when the ground state of the Hamiltonian is paramagnetic. Such decay is not present when the ground state is ferromagnetic.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy when mass conservation is imposed. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of isochemical potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy production in macroscopic systems is non-negative, reaching zero only at thermodynamic equilibrium. As a corollary, this implies that the state trajectory of macroscopic systems is inherently time-irreversible under out-of-equilibrium conditions. However, over the past half-century, various studies have shown that this principle does not universally apply to the composition sample paths of certain isothermal reactive systems. Theoretical frameworks leading to this surprising observation primarily focus on perfectly homogeneous systems (often referred to as zero-dimensional systems), which inherently exclude the effects of local fluctuations. This oversimplification may account for the paradoxical theoretical predictions. In the absence of relevant experimental data, this paper seeks to explore this phenomenon through microscopic simulations.</description>

      <title>Rigorous bound on hydrodynamic diffusion for chaotic open spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the spin, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We establish for the first time, with Lindbladian evolution, a lower bound on spin diffusion in chaotic, translation-invariant, nearest-neighbor open quantum spin-$1/2$ chain satisfying a local detailed-balance condition and strong conservation of magnetisation. The bound is strictly positive if and only if the local quantum jumps transport spin. Physically, the bound comes from the spreading effects of initial-state macroscopic fluctuations, a mechanism which occurs whenever spin is an interacting ballistic mode. Chaoticity means that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is spanned by magnetisation; we expect this to be generic. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Because Lindbladian dynamics is not reversible, the Green-Kubo spin diffusion strength includes a contribution due to irreversibility, which we interpret as encoding the hydrodynamic entropy production that may occur in the forgotten environment. This, we show, vanishes for certain choices of interaction parameters, for which the Lindbladian dynamics becomes reversible. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, higher spins, and other non-Hamiltonian systems such as quantum circuits. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect these systems to display superdiffusion, and thus have {\em infinite} diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of random matrices with generalised correlations: a path integral approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory allows one to deduce the eigenvalue spectrum of a large matrix given only statistical information about its elements. Such results provide insight into what factors contribute to the stability of complex dynamical systems. In this letter, we study the eigenvalue spectrum of an ensemble of random matrices with correlations between any pair of elements. To this end, we introduce an analytical method that maps the resolvent of the random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling us to make deductions about the eigenvalue spectrum. Our central result is a simple, closed-form expression for the leading eigenvalue of a large random matrix with generalised correlations. This formula demonstrates that correlations between matrix elements that are not diagonally opposite, which are often neglected, can have a significant impact on stability.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Trotter transitions in unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of `Krylov complexity', a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Heatbath Algorithm in LFT using Generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heatbath Algorithm is commonly used for sampling in local lattice field theories, but performing exact updates or sampling from the local density is challenging when dealing with continuous variables. Heatbath methods rely on rejection-based sampling at each site, which can suffer from low acceptance rates if the proposal distribution is not optimally chosen a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a novel, straightforward approach for generating proposals at each lattice site for the phi4 and XY models using generative AI models. This method learns a conditional local distribution, without requiring training samples from the target, conditioned on both neighboring sites and action parameter values.</description>

      <title>Temporal Contrastive Learning through implicit non-equilibrium memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backpropagation method has enabled transformative uses of neural networks. Alternatively, for energy-based models, local learning methods involving only nearby neurons offer benefits in terms of decentralized training, and allow for the possibility of learning in computationally-constrained substrates. One class of local learning methods constrasts the desired, clamped behavior with spontaneous, free behavior. However, directly contrasting free and clamped behaviors requires explicit memory. Here, we introduce `Temporal Contrastive Learning', an approach that uses integral feedback in each learning degree of freedom to provide a simple form of implicit non-equilibrium memory. During training, free and clamped behaviors are shown in a sawtooth-like protocol over time. When combined with integral feedback dynamics, these alternating temporal protocols generate an implicit memory necessary for comparing free and clamped behaviors, broadening the range of physical and biological systems capable of contrastive learning. Finally, we show that non-equilibrium dissipation improves learning quality and determine a Landauer-like energy cost of contrastive learning through physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, a systematic classification of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize the Abelian eigenvalue topology of generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing topological invariants called resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by resultants. In a $D$-dimensional parameter space ($D\geq c$), the resultant winding number topologically characterize a $(D-c)$-dimensional manifold of generic [symmetry-protected] EP$n$s whose codimension is $c=2n-2$ [$c=n-1$]. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems for both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in three-dimensional $Z(2)$ LGT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library. However, we show that overfitting arises - not just from individual model complexity, but also from the combinatorial growth of possible models. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>
