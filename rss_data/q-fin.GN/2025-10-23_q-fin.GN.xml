      <title>Tailoring Portfolio Choice via Quantile-Targeted Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic investment decisions of investors who prioritise specific quantiles of outcomes over their expected values. Downside-focused agents targeting low quantiles reduce risk in states with high variance, while those with a preference for high quantiles concentrate in sleeves with high dispersion when there is potential for upside. These results provide a microfoundation for volatility management, demonstrating that reducing exposure in volatile states is an optimal response for risk-averse investors and rationalising inverse-variance heuristics. We propose a distributional actor-critic algorithm that learns time-consistent policies tailored to these specific risks, irrespective of the utilitys functional form. The quantile value can be mapped onto interpretable tilts, and the performance of empirically chosen portfolios aligns with investors objectives.</description>

      <title>An Empirical study on Mutual fund factor-risk-shifting and its intensity on Indian Equity Mutual funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investment style groups investment approaches to predict portfolio return variations. This study examines the relationship between investment style, style consistency, and risk-adjusted returns of Indian equity mutual funds. The methodology involves estimating size and style beta coefficients, identifying breakpoints, analysing investment styles, and assessing risk-shifting intensity. Funds transition across styles over time, reflecting rotation, drift, or strengthening trends. Many Mid Blend funds remain in the same category, while others shift to Large Blend or Mid Value, indicating value-oriented strategies or large-cap exposure. Some funds adopt high-return styles like Small Value and Small Blend, aiming for alpha through small-cap equities. Performance changes following risk structure shifts are analyzed by comparing pre- and post-shift metrics, showing that style adjustments can enhance returns based on market conditions. This study contributes to mutual fund evaluation literature by highlighting the impact of style transitions on returns.</description>

      <title>The Promise and Peril of Generative AI: Evidence from GPT as Sell-Side Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to democratize financial analysis by reducing information-processing costs. Yet equal access does not ensure equal outcomes, as the locus of friction may shift from processing information to evaluating model outputs. We study GPT's earnings forecasts following corporate earnings releases and document two patterns. First, GPT's narrative attention is consistent and human-like but not always associated with higher forecast accuracy. Second, its quantitative reasoning varies substantially across contexts, challenging the view that LLMs are uniformly weak at numerical tasks. Building on these insights, we propose a diagnostic framework that links forecast accuracy to observable processing features (i.e., narrative focus, numerical reasoning, and self-assessed confidence). These indicators serve as proxies for this new form of information friction and alert investors when to exercise caution. Our study has implications for information frictions, regulatory oversight, and the economics of AI-mediated financial markets.</description>
