      <title>Lyrics Matter: Exploiting the Power of Learnt Representations for Music Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting music popularity is a critical challenge in the music industry, offering benefits to artists, producers, and streaming platforms. Prior research has largely focused on audio features, social metadata, or model architectures. This work addresses the under-explored role of lyrics in predicting popularity. We present an automated pipeline that uses LLM to extract high-dimensional lyric embeddings, capturing semantic, syntactic, and sequential information. These features are integrated into HitMusicLyricNet, a multimodal architecture that combines audio, lyrics, and social metadata for popularity score prediction in the range 0-100. Our method outperforms existing baselines on the SpotGenTrack dataset, which contains over 100,000 tracks, achieving 9% and 20% improvements in MAE and MSE, respectively. Ablation confirms that gains arise from our LLM-driven lyrics feature pipeline (LyricsAENet), underscoring the value of dense lyric representations.</description>

      <title>The T12 System for AudioMOS Challenge 2025: Audio Aesthetics Score Prediction System Using KAN- and VERSA-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an audio aesthetics score (AES) prediction system by CyberAgent (AESCA) for AudioMOS Challenge 2025 (AMC25) Track 2. The AESCA comprises a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN)-based audiobox aesthetics and a predictor from the metric scores using the VERSA toolkit. In the KAN-based predictor, we replaced each multi-layer perceptron layer in the baseline model with a group-rational KAN and trained the model with labeled and pseudo-labeled audio samples. The VERSA-based predictor was designed as a regression model using extreme gradient boosting, incorporating outputs from existing metrics. Both the KAN- and VERSA-based models predicted the AES, including the four evaluation axes. The final AES values were calculated using an ensemble model that combined four KAN-based models and a VERSA-based model. Our proposed T12 system yielded the best correlations among the submitted systems, in three axes at the utterance level, two axes at the system level, and the overall average.</description>

      <title>SyncVoice: Towards Video Dubbing with Vision-Augmented Pretrained TTS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.</description>

      <title>MuMeNet: A Network Simulator for Musical Metaverse Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Metaverse, a shared and spatially organized digital continuum, is transforming various industries, with music emerging as a leading use case. Live concerts, collaborative composition, and interactive experiences are driving the Musical Metaverse (MM), but the requirements of the underlying network and service infrastructures hinder its growth. These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using "live audience interaction in a virtual concert" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.</description>

      <title>Decoding Selective Auditory Attention to Musical Elements in Ecologically Valid Music Listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Wavehax: Aliasing-Free Neural Waveform Synthesis Based on 2D Convolution and Harmonic Prior for Reliable Complex Spectrogram Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural vocoders often struggle with aliasing in latent feature spaces, caused by time-domain nonlinear operations and resampling layers. Aliasing folds high-frequency components into the low-frequency range, making aliased and original frequency components indistinguishable and introducing two practical issues. First, aliasing complicates the waveform generation process, as the subsequent layers must address these aliasing effects, increasing the computational complexity. Second, it limits extrapolation performance, particularly in handling high fundamental frequencies, which degrades the perceptual quality of generated speech waveforms. This paper demonstrates that 1) time-domain nonlinear operations inevitably introduce aliasing but provide a strong inductive bias for harmonic generation, and 2) time-frequency-domain processing can achieve aliasing-free waveform synthesis but lacks the inductive bias for effective harmonic generation. Building on this insight, we propose Wavehax, an aliasing-free neural WAVEform generator that integrates 2D convolution and a HArmonic prior for reliable Complex Spectrogram estimation. Experimental results show that Wavehax achieves speech quality comparable to existing high-fidelity neural vocoders and exhibits exceptional robustness in scenarios requiring high fundamental frequency extrapolation, where aliasing effects become typically severe. Moreover, Wavehax requires less than 5% of the multiply-accumulate operations and model parameters compared to HiFi-GAN V1, while achieving over four times faster CPU inference speed.</description>

      <title>Yours or Mine? Overwriting Attacks Against Neural Audio Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative audio models are rapidly evolving, AI-generated audios increasingly raise concerns about copyright infringement and misinformation spread. Audio watermarking, as a proactive defense, can embed secret messages into audio for copyright protection and source verification. However, current neural audio watermarking methods focus primarily on the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking, while ignoring its vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we develop a simple yet powerful attack: the overwriting attack that overwrites the legitimate audio watermark with a forged one and makes the original legitimate watermark undetectable. Based on the audio watermarking information that the adversary has, we propose three categories of overwriting attacks, i.e., white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks. We also thoroughly evaluate the proposed attacks on state-of-the-art neural audio watermarking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overwriting attacks can effectively compromise existing watermarking schemes across various settings and achieve a nearly 100% attack success rate. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed overwriting attacks expose security flaws in existing neural audio watermarking systems, underscoring the need to enhance security in future audio watermarking designs.</description>
