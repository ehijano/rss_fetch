      <title>Nonreciprocal Model B: The role of mobilities and nonreciprocal interfacial forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-reciprocal version of Model B, as the continuum theory for non-reciprocal particle mixtures. In contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, it is important in this context to consider the dependence of mobility coefficients on the local concentrations. We show that a homogeneous state that is linearly stable for one form of the mobility can be unstable for a different form of mobility, an effect that would be impossible in equilibrium and implies a crucial role for mobilities in non-reciprocal mixtures. For unstable homogeneous states we study the spinodal dynamics governing the onset of phase separation. We find, again in contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, that exceptional point transitions between static and oscillatory instabilities are generically avoided by first order transitions where the spinodal lengthscale changes discontinuously. At these transitions we find intricate spinodal dynamics with two competing lengthscales, one governing a static instability and the other an oscillatory instability, i.e. one that generates travelling waves. We demonstrate that, depending on interaction strengths, more complex transitions can occur in the spinodal dynamics, including coexistence of three lengthscales and first order transition lines, terminated by critical points, between distinct static instabilities. Finally, we explore the effects of additional non-reciprocity in the interfacial chemical potentials, which would generically be expected when obtaining Model B by coarse graining from a non-reciprocal particle model. We show that interfacial non-reciprocity can increase the region in the spinodal phase diagram where oscillatory instabilities occur, but only up to a certain boundary that we establish analytically and demonstrate numerically.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Air Fluidization during Intruder Penetration in Sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-burrowing robots navigating through granular media benefit from airflow-assisted burrowing, which reduces penetration resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying airflow-granular interactions remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employ a coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach, supplemented by experimental cone penetration tests (CPT) under varying airflow conditions, to investigate the effects of aeration on penetration resistance. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between penetration resistance reduction and depth, wherein resistance approaches near-zero values up to a critical depth, beyond which the effectiveness of fluidization diminishes. Simulations demonstrate that higher airflow rates enhance the mobilization of overlying grains, increasing the critical depth. A detailed meso- and micro-scale analysis of particle motion, contact forces, and fluid pressure fields reveals four distinct penetration stages: particle ejection and channel formation, channel sealing, channel refill, and final compaction. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of granular aeration mechanisms and their implications for geotechnical engineering, excavation technologies, and the development of self-burrowing robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality transfer in lyotropic twist-bend nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular simulations and classical density functional theory, we study the liquid-crystalline phase behaviour of a series of bent rod-like mesogens with a controlled degree of chirality introduced through a twist at the centre of the particle. In the achiral limit, isotropic, uniaxial nematic, twist-bend nematic and smectic phases form as the packing fraction increases. On introducing chirality, the symmetry between the right- and left-handed twist-bend phases is broken. The phase with the same-handedness as the particles quickly becomes overwhelmingly favoured as the magnitude of the particle twist is increased, because the particles are then able to better follow the helical director field lines in the twist-bend phase and pack more efficiently. By contrast, the cholesteric phase is predicted to have the opposite handedness to that of the particle due to the relatively weakly-twisted nature of the particles. That the cholesteric and twist-bend phases have opposite handedness illustrates the differences in the mechanisms of chirality transfer in the two phases. We also found that doping a system of achiral mesogens with a small fraction of chiral particles led to selection of the twist-bend phase with the same chirality as the particle.</description>

      <title>Transition to chaos with conical billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt ideas from geometrical optics and classical billiard dynamics to consider particle trajectories with constant velocity on a cone with specular reflections off an elliptical boundary formed by the intersection with a tilted plane, with tilt angle $\gamma$. We explore the dynamics as a function of $\gamma$ and the cone deficit angle $\chi$ that controls the sharpness of the apex, where a point source of positive Gaussian curvature is concentrated. We find regions of the ($\gamma, \chi$) plane where, depending on the initial conditions, either (A) the trajectories sample the entire cone base and avoid the apex region; (B) sample only a portion of the base region while again avoiding the apex; or (C) sample the entire cone surface much more uniformly, suggestive of ergodicity. The special case of an untilted cone displays only type A trajectories which form a ring caustic at the distance of closest approach to the apex. However, we observe an intricate transition to chaotic dynamics dominated by Type (C) trajectories for sufficiently large $\chi$ and $\gamma$. A Poincar\'e map that summarizes trajectories decomposed into the geodesic segments interrupted by specular reflections provides a powerful method for visualizing the transition to chaos. We then analyze the similarities and differences of the path to chaos for conical billiards with other area-preserving conservative maps.</description>

      <title>Water Entry Dynamics of Superhydrophobic and Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces: A Theoretical and Experimental Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this current work, a comprehensive investigation into the impact dynamics of superhydrophobic and lubricant-impregnated aluminium sphere balls on liquid surfaces were carried out. The study delves into the hydrodynamic lubrication behavior and the resulting phenomena during impact. The Worthington jet and cavity associated give more insight into fundamental forces. The experimental analysis and theoretical modeling suggest potential applications in various fields such as fluid dynamics, tribology, and materials science. The stability investigation on an aluminum-textured sphere ball is carried out, and the evaluation of jet height and pinch-off phenomena is analyzed in detail. The experiment on entrapped air on a superhydrophobic surface and the oil inside the LIS for greater height was performed. The experimental setup involved a carefully designed apparatus for impact analysis by utilizing high-speed imaging techniques. Parameters such as impact velocity, Weber number, and sphere diameter were systematically varied to understand their influence on the observed dynamics. The lubricant viscosity is chosen such that it is comparable to water viscosity. Furthermore, the study on Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (LIS) assessed frictional losses, i.e., drag reduction, compared to control and textured surfaces. In conclusion, the valuable insights into the impact dynamics advance our understanding of hydrodynamic lubrication and its applications. The findings presented here underscore the importance of further research in optimizing surface properties, selecting suitable lubricants, and exploring broader applications in the fields of fluid dynamics, surface engineering, and mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>Delay-facilitated self-assembly in compartmentalized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of ice-active solutions at ice-water interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small molecules that interact strongly with water were the subject of this molecular dynamics (MD) study. These solutes include a cryoprotectant (DMSO), a polyalcohol [CH$_2$(OH)$_2$], carboxylic acid conjugates (HCOOH and HCOONa), an ammonium salt (NH$_4$Cl), and two alkyl halide salts (NaCl and NaF). MD simulations were carried out for bulk supercooled liquids and solutions in contact with ice. Solute and water hydrogen bonding, orientational and translational order, and hydrogen bond jump dynamics were compared in bulk and as a function of distance from the solute molecules. Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations were used to determine interfacial widths, friction coefficients ($\kappa$) with ice, and solution phase viscosities ($\eta$). Ionic solutes were found to reduce orientational and translational ordering near the ice interfaces. However, in bulk liquids, we find a correlation between orientational ordering and the statistics of water hydrogen bonds -- a donor-acceptor imbalance in water has the greatest impact on ordering in the bulk liquids. Although ionic solutions exhibited similar effects on the water structure, the effect on dynamics depends most directly on donor-acceptor imbalance. Solutes that are hydrogen bond acceptors were found to slow hydrogen bond lifetimes relative to hydrogen bond donors. We also observed a direct correlation between the liquid phase hydrogen-bond jump times and shear viscosity. Finally, of all the solutes studied, only DMSO and sodium formate exhibited increased friction at the ice-water interface.</description>

Abstract: When probe molecules of interest are embedded in a container or aggregate under stochastic motion, one needs to rely on the so-called two-point mean square displacement (MSD) measurement to extract the intrinsic mobility of the probes. We discuss two versions, based on the time series of relative vector or distance between two probes, and summarize their basic properties compared to the standard MSD. We also propose a way to extract (i) the non-Gaussianity in the displacement statistics and (ii) the motional correlation between probes from the two-point MSD. The results are presented not only for independent probes, but also for intramolecular probes within a long polymer, which could be useful in quantifying the dynamics of chromatin loci in living cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes for unsteady diffusion across particle-stabilized fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal particles at fluid interfaces can enhance the stability of drops and bubbles. Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of jamming in granular force networks via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular materials exhibit intricate force networks, often concentrated in chains rather than being uniformly distributed. These meso-scale structures are complex to characterize, owing to their heterogeneous and anisotropic nature. We present a topological analysis in which we characterize force networks by studying the connectivity of contact forces in granular materials. We obtain the force network data during the isotropic compression of a 2D granular ensemble, which comprises of bidisperse photoelastic disks. The force chains are visualized using a bright-field polariscope, which are then analyzed using photoelasticity techniques to get contact force information across all the particles in the granular ensemble. The forces and contact network are studied using topological descriptors. We analyze the evolution of these descriptors using methods developed in the areas of computational topology and persistent homology. Specifically, we evaluate the number of homology class generators to capture critical changes in network connectivity with the evolution of packing fraction. Building on previous applications of persistent homology, our topological analysis of the force network provides valuable insights by distinguishing different phases of particle interactions and revealing unique structural transitions around jamming and thus help enhance our understanding of the stability and jamming dynamics in granular systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Waves without Spin-Waves: A Case for Soliton Propagation in Starling Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.</description>
