      <title>Matroid reinforcement and sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous matroids are characterized by the property that strength equals fractional arboricity, and arise in the study of base modulus [22]. For graphic matroids, Cunningham [9] provided efficient algorithms for calculating graph strength, and also for determining minimum cost reinforcement to achieve a desired strength. This paper extends this latter problem by focusing on two optimal strategies for transforming a matroid into a homogeneous one, by either increasing or decreasing element weights. As an application to graphs, we give algorithms to solve this problem in the context of spanning trees.</description>

      <title>$q$-Binomial Identities Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a symbolic computation method for automatically transforming $q$-hypergeometric identities to $q$-binomial identities. Through this method, many previously proven $q$-binomial identities, including $q$-Saalsch\"utz's formula and $q$-Suranyi's formula, are re-fund, and numerous new ones are discovered. Moreover, the generation of the identities is accompanied by the corresponding proofs. During the transformation process, different ranges of variable values and various combinations of $q$-Pochhammer symbols yield different identities. The algorithm maps variable constraints to positive elements in an ordered vector space and employs a backtracking method to provide the feasible variable constraints and $q$-binomial coefficient combinations for each step.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Pot Generation: Algorithms for the Flexible-Tile Model of DNA Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in microbiology have motivated the study of the production of nanostructures with applications such as biomedical computing and molecular robotics. One way to construct these structures is to construct branched DNA molecules that bond to each other at complementary cohesive ends. One practical question is: given a target nanostructure, what is the optimal set of DNA molecules that assemble such a structure? We use a flexible-tile graph theoretic model to develop several algorithmic approaches, including a integer programming approach. These approaches take a target undirected graph as an input and output an optimal collection of component building blocks to construct the desired structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) &gt; p(n+m)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be a graph type and B an equivalence relation on a group $G$. Let $[g]$ be the equivalence class of $g$ with respect to the equivalence relation B. The B superA graph of $G$ is an undirected graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $g, h \in G$ are adjacent if $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $x \in [g]$ and $y \in [h]$ such that $x$ and $y$ are adjacent in the A graph of $G$. In this paper, we compute spectrum of equality/conjugacy supercommuting graphs of dihedral/dicyclic groups and show that these graphs are not integral.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of the singular vector of a reciprocal matrix and comparison to the Perron vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models using pair-wise (ratio) comparisons among alternatives (reciprocal matrices A) to deduce a cardinal ranking vector, the right Perron eigenvector was traditionally used, though several other options have emerged. We propose and motivate another alternative, the left singular vector (Perron eigenvector of AA^{T}). Theory is developed. We show that for reciprocal matrices obtained from consistent matrices by modifying one column, and the corresponding row, the cone generated by the columns is efficient, implying that the Perron vector and the left singular vector of such matrices are always efficient. In addition, the two vectors are compared empirically for random matrices. With regard to efficiency, the left singular vector consistently outperforms the right Perron eigenvector, though both perform well for large numbers of alternatives.</description>

      <title>Saturation of edge-ordered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an edge-ordered graph $G$, we say that an $n$-vertex edge-ordered graph $H$ is $G$-saturated if it is $G$-free and adding any new edge with any new label to $H$ introduces a copy of $G$. The saturation function describes the minimum number of edges of a $G$-saturated graph. In particular, we study the order of magnitude of these functions. For (unordered) graphs, $0$-$1$ matrices, and vertex-ordered graphs it was possible to show that the saturation functions are either $O(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$. We show that the saturation functions of edge-ordered graphs are also either $O(1)$ or $\Omega(n)$. However, by finding edge-ordered graphs whose saturation functions are superlinear, we show that such a dichotomy result does not hold in general.
  Additionally, we consider the semisaturation problem of edge-ordered graphs, a variant of the saturation problem where we do not require that $H$ is $G$-free. We show a general upper bound $O(n \log n)$ and characterize edge-ordered graphs with bounded semisaturation function.
  We also present various classes of graphs with bounded, linear and superlinear (semi)saturation functions. Along the way, we define a natural variant of the above problem, where the new edge must get the smallest label. The behaviour of the two variants shows many similarities, which motivated us to investigate the second variant extensively as well.</description>

Abstract: Consider a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-subsets of an ambient $(k^2-k+1)$-set such that no pair of $k$-subsets in $\mathcal{F}$ intersects in exactly one element. In this short note we show that the maximal size of such $\mathcal{F}$ is $\binom{k^2-k-1}{k-2}$ for every $k &gt; 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of 3D cubiculated regions. The tilings have two invariants, flux and twist, often integer-valued, which are given in purely combinatorial terms. These invariants allow one to classify the tilings with respect to certain elementary moves, flips and trits. In this paper we present a construction associating a divergence-free vector field $\xi_t$ to any domino tiling $t$, such that the flux of the tiling $t$ can be interpreted as the (relative) rotation class of the field $\xi_t$, while the twist of $t$ is proved to be the relative helicity of the field $\xi_t$.</description>

      <title>Biased domination games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a biased version of Maker-Breaker domination games, which were recently introduced by Gledel, Ir{\v{s}}i{\v{c}}, and Klav{\v{z}}ar. Two players, Dominator and Staller, alternatingly claim vertices of a graph $G$ where Dominator is allowed to claim up to $b$ vertices in every round and she wins if and only if she occupies all vertices of a dominating set of $G$. For this game, we prove a full characterization of all trees on which Dominator has a winning strategy. For the number of rounds which Dominator needs to win, we give exact results when played on powers of paths or cycles, and for all trees we provide bounds which are optimal up to a constant factor not depending on $b$. Furthermore, we discuss general minimum degree conditions and study how many vertices can still be dominated by Dominator even when Staller has a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic enumeration and limit shapes of monotone grid classes of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a procedure to asymptotically enumerate monotone grid classes of permutations. This is then applied to compute the asymptotic number of permutations in any connected one-corner class. Our strategy consists of enumerating the gridded permutations, finding the asymptotic distribution of points between the cells in a typical large gridded permutation, and analysing in detail the ways in which a typical permutation can be gridded. We also determine the limit shape of any connected monotone grid class.</description>

      <title>Representability of the direct sum of uniform q-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many similarities between the theories of matroids and $q$-matroids. However, when dealing with the direct sum of $q$-matroids many differences arise. Most notably, it has recently been shown that the direct sum of representable $q$-matroids is not necessarily representable. In this work, we focus on the direct sum of uniform $q$-matroids. Using algebraic and geometric tools, together with the notion of cyclic flats of $q$-matroids, we show that this is always representable, by providing a representation over a sufficiently large field.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $\gamma$-positivity of Chow rings and augmented Chow rings of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Chow ring and augmented Chow ring of a matroid is equivariant $\gamma$-positivity under the action of any group of automorphisms of the matroid. This verifies a conjecture of Angarone, Nathanson, and Reiner. Our method gives an explicit interpretation to the coefficients of the equivariant $\gamma$-expansion. Applying our theorem to uniform matroids, we extend and recover several known results regarding uniform matroids and Eulerian quasisymmetric functions. Using these results, we are able to answer a problem proposed by Athanasiadis about extending the $\gamma$-expansion of the binomial Eulerian polynomial.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Lyons Conjecture I: Subgroup Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07]. This conjecture, originated in probability theory, is well known (cf. [Gel18]) to be equivalent to the statement that every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic. We disprove this last statement.
  In this part we introduce subgroup tests. These tests are finite distributions over continuous functions from the space of subgroups of the free group to $\{0,1\}$. Subgroup tests provide a general framework in which one can study invariant random subgroups of the free group. Classical notions such as group soficity and group stability arise naturally in this framework. By the correspondence between subgroups of the free group and Schreier graphs, one can view subgroup tests as a property testing model for certain edge-labeled graphs. This correspondence also provides the connection to random networks.
  Subgroup tests have values, which are their asymptotic optimal expectations when integrated against co-sofic invariant random subgroups. Our first main result is that, if every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic, then one can approximate the value of a subgroup test up to any positive additive constant. Our second main result is an essentially value preserving correspondence between certain non-local games and subgroup tests. By composing this correspondence with a stronger variant of the reduction in MIP*=RE [JNV+21], proved in the companion paper [BCV24], we deduce that approximating the sofic value of a subgroup test is as hard as the Halting Problem, and in particular, undecidable. The combination of our two main results proves the existence of non co-sofic invariant random subgroups of the free group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freiman's $3k-4$ Theorem states that if a subset $A$ of $k$ integers has a Minkowski sum $A+A$ of size at most $3k-4$, then it must be contained in a short arithmetic progression. We prove a function field analogue that is also a generalisation: it states that if $K$ is a perfect field and if $S\supset K$ is a vector space of dimension $k$ inside an extension $F/K$ in which~$K$ is algebraically closed, and if the $K$-vector space generated by all products of pairs of elements of $S$ has dimension at most $3k-4$, then $K(S)$ is a function field of small genus, and $S$ is of small codimension inside a Riemann-Roch space of $K(S)$.</description>

      <title>On Certain Polytopes Associated to Products of Algebraic Integer Conjugates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $d&gt;k$ be positive integers. Motivated by an earlier result of Bugeaud and Nguyen, we let $E_{k,d}$ be the set of $(c_1,\ldots,c_k)\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^k$ such that $\vert\alpha_0\vert\vert\alpha_1\vert^{c_1}\cdots\vert\alpha_k\vert^{c_k}\geq 1$ for any algebraic integer $\alpha$ of degree $d$, where we label its Galois conjugates as $\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_{d-1}$ with $\vert\alpha_0\vert\geq \vert\alpha_1\vert\geq\cdots \geq \vert\alpha_{d-1}\vert$. First, we give an explicit description of $E_{k,d}$ as a polytope with $2^k$ vertices. Then we prove that for $d&gt;3k$, for every $(c_1,\ldots,c_k)\in E_{k,d}$ and for every $\alpha$ that is not a root of unity, the strict inequality $\vert\alpha_0\vert\vert\alpha_1\vert^{c_1}\cdots\vert\alpha_k\vert^{c_k}&gt;1$ holds. We also provide a quantitative version of this inequality in terms of $d$ and the height of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left and right diameters of a monoid are topological invariants defined in terms of suprema of lengths of derivation sequences with respect to finite generating sets for the universal left or right congruences. We compute these parameters for the endomorphism monoid $End(C)$ of a chain $C$. Specifically, if $C$ is infinite then the left diameter of $End(C)$ is 2, while the right diameter is either 2 or 3, with the latter equal to 2 precisely when $C$ is a quotient of $C{\setminus}\{z\}$ for some endpoint $z$. If $C$ is finite then so is $End(C),$ in which case the left and right diameters are 1 (if $C$ is non-trivial) or 0.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total variation. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we compute the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We carry out a search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for a highly-symmetric qutrit magic state known as the strange state. Our search covers a large class of $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with up to 23 qutrits, and is facilitated by a theorem that relates the distillation performance of a qudit stabilizer code to its weight-enumerators. We could not find any code with $n&lt;23$ qutrits that distills the strange state with better than linear noise suppression, other than the 11-qutrit Golay code. However, for $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <title>On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in $\mathbb C^2$, such that the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann surface. The property of interest in this paper is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry, we give an algorithm to compute this genus. We provide an implementation in Python and give various examples.</description>

      <title>On the Eigenvalues of Graphs with Mixed Algebraic Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some spectral properties of a matrix that is constructed as a combination of a Laplacian and an adjacency matrix of simple graphs. The matrix considered depends on a positive parameter, as such we consider the implications in different regimes of such a parameter, perturbative and beyond. Our main goal is to relate spectral properties to the graph's configuration, or to basic properties of the Laplacian and adjacency matrices. We explain the connections with dynamic networks and their stability properties, which lead us to state a conjecture for the signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering regular graphs with every edge in a triangle we prove lower bounds for the number of triangles in such graphs. For r-regular graphs with r &lt;= 5 we exhibit families of graphs with exactly that number of triangles and then classify all such graphs using line graphs and even cycle decompositions. Examples of ways to create such r-regular graphs with r &gt;= 6 are also given. In the 5-regular case, these minimal graphs are proven to be the only regular graphs with every edge in a triangle which cannot have an edge removed and still have every edge in a triangle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative, simple method to prove isoperimetric inequalities over the hypercube. In particular, we show:
  1. An elementary proof of classical isoperimetric inequalities of Talagrand, as well as a stronger isoperimetric result conjectured by Talagrand and recently proved by Eldan and Gross.
  2. A strengthening of the Friedgut junta theorem, asserting that if the $p$-moment of the sensitivity of a function is constant for some $1/2 + \varepsilon\leq p\leq 1$, then the function is close to a junta. In this language, Friedgut's theorem is the special case that $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: For $d \ge 2$, we show that all graphs of $d$-polytopes have a Hamiltonian line graph if and only if $d \ne 3$: We exhibit a graph of a $3$-polytope on $252$ vertices whose line graph does not even have Hamiltonian paths. Adapting a construction by Gr\"unbaum and Motzkin, for large $n$ we also construct simple 3-polytopes on $3n$ vertices in whose line graph any simple path is shorter than $10 n^{\alpha}$, for some constant $\alpha&lt;1$. Moreover, we give four elementary counterexamples of plausible extensions to simplicial complexes of four famous results in Hamiltonian graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the set of quadratic residues (i.e. squares) in finite fields, $\mathbb F_q$, when considered as a subset of the additive group. We conjecture that as $q \to \infty$, the squares have the maximum possible VC-dimension, viz. $(1+o(1))\log_2 q$. We prove, using the Weil bound for multiplicative character sums, that the VC-dimension is $\geq (\frac{1}{2} + o(1))\log_2 q$. We also provide numerical evidence for our conjectures. The results generalize to multiplicative subgroups $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb F_q^\times$ of bounded index.</description>

      <title>The Nash-Williams orientation theorem for graphs with countably many ends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nash-Williams proved in 1960 that a finite graph admits a $k$-arc-connected orientation if and only if it is $2k$-edge-connected, and conjectured that the same result should hold for all infinite graphs, too.
  Progress on Nash-Williams's problem was made by C. Thomassen, who proved in 2016 that all $8k$-edge-connected infinite graphs admit a $k$-arc connected orientation, and by the first author, who recently showed that edge-connectivity of $4k$ suffices for locally-finite, 1-ended graphs.
  In the present article, we establish the optimal bound $2k$ in Nash-Williams's conjecture for all locally finite graphs with countably many ends.</description>

      <title>Using a Grassmann graph to recover the underlying projective geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n&gt;2k\geq 6$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements, and let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ that has dimension $n$. The projective geometry $P_q(n)$ is the partially ordered set consisting of the subspaces of $V$; the partial order is given by inclusion. For the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ the vertex set consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. The graph $J_q(n,k)$ is known to be distance-regular. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick two vertices $x,y$ in $J_q(n,k)$ such that $1&lt;\partial(x,y)&lt;k$. The set $P_q(n)$ contains the elements $x,y,x\cap y,x+y$. In our main result, we describe $x\cap y$ and $x+y$ using only the graph structure of $J_q(n,k)$. To achieve this result, we make heavy use of the Euclidean representation of $J_q(n,k)$ that corresponds to the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>A Dense Model Theorem for the Boolean Slice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (low soundness) linearity testing problem for the middle slice of the Boolean cube is as follows. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $f$ be a function on the middle slice on the Boolean cube, such that when choosing a uniformly random quadruple $(x,y,z ,x\oplus y\oplus z)$ of vectors of $2n$ bits with exactly $n$ ones, the probability that $f(x\oplus y \oplus z) = f(x) \oplus f(y) \oplus f(z)$ is at least $1/2+\varepsilon$. The linearity testing problem, posed by David, Dinur, Goldenberg, Kindler and Shinkar, asks whether there must be an actual linear function that agrees with $f$ on $1/2+\varepsilon'$ fraction of the inputs, where $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon'(\varepsilon)&gt;0$.
  We solve this problem, showing that $f$ must indeed be correlated with a linear function. To do so, we prove a dense model theorem for the middle slice of the Boolean hypercube for Gowers uniformity norms. Specifically, we show that for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, the normalized indicator function of the middle slice of the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^{2n}$ is close in Gowers norm to the normalized indicator function of the union of all slices with weight $t = n\pmod{2^{k-1}}$. Using our techniques we also give a more general `low degree test' and a biased rank theorem for the slice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow Exact $k$-Nim is a variant of the well-known game of Nim. The rules of this variant are that in each move, $k$ of the $n$ stacks are selected and then one token is removed from each of the $k$ stacks. We will extend known results by proving results on the structure of the P-positions for the infinite family of Slow Exact $k$-Nim games where we play on all but one of the $n$ stacks. In addition, we will introduce a more general family of "slow" Nim variants, Slow SetNim($n$,$A$) which specifies the allowed moves via the set $A$. This family of games contains both Slow Exact $k$-Nim and the slow version of Moore's $k$-Nim. We give results for the infinite family of Slow SetNim($n$,$A$) for $A=\{n-1,n\}$, whose P-positions are closely related to those of Slow Exact $k$-Nim for $k=n-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four different constructions of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences, and use them to obtain expressions for the enumeration sequences of 22 distinct open cases. This completes the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3. Some of our constructions are based on generating trees. Others involve pattern-avoiding words, which we also count using generating trees. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization of inversion sequences, which we call shifted inversion sequences. It is sometimes easier to construct pattern-avoiding inversion sequences by seeing them as a particular case of shifted inversion sequences.</description>

Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

      <title>On distance-regular Cayley graphs over abelian groups of rank $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of constructing or characterizing strongly regular Cayley graphs (or equivalently, regular partial difference sets) has garnered significant attention over the past half-century. In [European J. Combin. 24 (2023) 777--784], Miklavi\v{c} and Poto\v{c}nik expanded upon this field, achieving a complete characterization of distance-regular Cayley graphs over cyclic groups by employing the method of Schur rings. In [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 97 (2007) 14--33], they formally proposed the problem of characterizing distance-regular Cayley graphs for any given class of groups. In this context, abelian groups are of particular importance, as a considerable number of distance-regular graphs with classical parameters are precisely Cayley graphs over abelian groups. In this paper, we address the Miklavi\v{c}-Poto\v{c}nik problem for abelian groups of rank $2$. More specifically, we identify all distance-regular Cayley graphs over the group $\mathbb{Z}_n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Our proof utilizes novel tools such as polynomial addition sets, Desarguesian affine planes, and the duality of Schur rings over abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a refined combinatorial identity for the set of partitions of $\{1,\dots, n\}$, which plays an important role in investigating several limit theorems related to finite free convolutions. Firstly, we present the finite free analogue of Sakuma and Yoshida's limit theorem. That is, we provide the limit of $\{D_{1/m}((p_d^{\boxtimes_d m})^{\boxplus_d m})\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ as $m\rightarrow\infty$ in two cases: (i) $m/d\rightarrow t$ for some $t&gt;0$, or (ii) $m/d\rightarrow0$. The second application presents a central limit theorem for finite free multiplicative convolution. We establish a connection between this theorem and the multiplicative free semicircular distributions through combinatorial identities. Our last result gives alternative proofs for Kabluchko's limit theorems concerning the unitary Hermite and the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a stability result for general $3$-wise correlations over distributions satisfying mild connectivity properties. More concretely, we show that if $\Sigma,\Gamma$ and $\Phi$ are alphabets of constant size, and $\mu$ is a pairwise connected distribution over $\Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi$ with no $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ embeddings in which the probability of each atom is $\Omega(1)$, then the following holds. Any triplets of $1$-bounded functions $f\colon \Sigma^n\to\mathbb{C}$, $g\colon \Gamma^n\to\mathbb{C}$, $h\colon \Phi^n\to\mathbb{C}$ satisfying
  \[
  \left|\mathbb{E}_{(x,y,z)\sim \mu^{\otimes n}}\big[f(x)g(y)h(z)\big]\right|\geq \varepsilon
  \]
  must arise from an Abelian group associated with the distribution $\mu$. More specifically, we show that there is an Abelian group $(H,+)$ of constant size such that for any such $f,g$ and $h$, the function $f$ (and similarly $g$ and $h$) is correlated with a function of the form $\tilde{f}(x) = \chi(\sigma(x_1),\ldots,\sigma(x_n)) L (x)$, where $\sigma\colon \Sigma \to H$ is some map, $\chi\in \hat{H}^{\otimes n}$ is a character, and $L\colon \Sigma^n\to\mathbb{C}$ is a low-degree function with bounded $2$-norm.
  En route we prove a few additional results that may be of independent interest, such as an improved direct product theorem, as well as a result we refer to as a ``restriction inverse theorem'' about the structure of functions that, under random restrictions, with noticeable probability have significant correlation with a product function. In companion papers, we show applications of our results to the fields of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, as well as various areas in discrete mathematics such as extremal combinatorics and additive combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>

Abstract: We develop formulas that define permutahedral commutation coherence relations of all orders. To illustrate the result geometrically, we begin by defining a rigid transformation of the $(n+1)$-permutahedron into a $n$-cube of dimensions $1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n$. With a fictitious assumption, we 'define' the corresponding coherence relations 'up to associativity' as an instance of a semi-simplicial type in the language of Displayed Type Theory. This is not a formal result in type theory, but we expect this to translate into one as soon as the problem of defining associahedral coherences is solved in a type theory with semi-simplicial types. On the other hand, this not-strictly-well-typed definition may be used to produce well-typed formulas in a restricted setting.</description>
