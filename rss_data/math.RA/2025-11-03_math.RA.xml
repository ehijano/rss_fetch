      <title>On Modules Whose Pure Submodules Are Essential in Direct Summands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of pure extending modules, a refinement of classical extending modules in which only pure submodules are required to be essential in direct summands. Fundamental properties and characterizations are established, showing that pure extending and extending modules coincide over von Neumann regular rings. As an application, we prove that pure extending modules admit decomposition patterns analogous to those in the classical theory, including a generalization of the Osofsky-Smith theorem: a cyclic module whose proper factor modules are pure extending decomposes into a finite direct sum of pure-uniform submodules. Additionally, we resolve an open problem of Dehghani and Sedaghatjoo by constructing a centrally quasi-morphic module that is not centrally morphic, arising from the link between pure-extending behavior and nonsingularity in finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Shifted double Poisson structures and noncommutative Poisson extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of noncommutative Poisson extensions. For an augmented dg algebra \(A\), we show that any shifted double Poisson bracket on \(A\) induces a graded Lie algebra structure on the reduced cyclic homology. Under the Kontsevich--Rosenberg principle, we further prove that the noncommutative Poisson extension is compatible with noncommutative Hamiltonian reduction. Moreover, we show that shifted double Poisson structures are independent of the choice of cofibrant resolutions and that they induce shifted Poisson structures on the derived moduli stack of representations.</description>

      <title>A Riemann-type duality of shuffle Hopf algebras related to multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a Hopf algebraic interpretation of a functional equation of multiple zeta functions, motivated by the classical symmetry of the Riemann zeta function. Starting from the extended shuffle algebra that encodes multiple zeta values (MZVs) at integer arguments, we show that its subalgebra corresponding to nonpositive arguments carries a natural differential Hopf algebra structure. This Hopf algebra is in graded linear duality with the shuffle Hopf algebra associated to MZVs at positive arguments. The resulting duality, realized through an explicit isomorphism, provides an algebraic analog of the functional equation relating $\zeta(s)$ with $\zeta(1-s)$ of the Riemann zeta function and unifies the positive and nonpositive sectors of multiple zeta functions within a common Hopf algebraic framework.</description>

      <title>Manin triples, bialgebras and Yang-Baxter equation of $A_3$-associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $A_3$-associative algebra is a generalization of associative algebra and is one of the four remarkable types of Lie-admissible algebras, along with associative algebra, left-symmetric algebra and right-symmetric algebra. This paper develops bialgebra theory for $A_3$-associative algebras. We introduce Manin triples and bialgebras for $A_3$-associative algebras, prove their equivalence using matched pairs of $A_3$-associative algebras, and define the $A_3$-associative Yang-Baxter equation and triangular $A_3$-associative bialgebras. Additionally, we introduce relative Rota-Baxter operators to provide skew-symmetric solutions of the $A_3$-associative Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>The integro-differential closure of a commutative differential ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integro-differential ring is a differential ring that is closed under an integration operation satisfying the fundamental theorem of calculus. Via the Newton--Leibniz formula, a generalized evaluation is defined in terms of integration and differentiation. The induced evaluation is not necessarily multiplicative, which allows to model functions with singularities and leads to generalized shuffle relations. In general, not every element of a differential ring has an antiderivative in the same ring. Starting from a commutative differential ring and a direct decomposition into integrable and non-integrable elements, we construct the free integro-differential ring. This integro-differential closure contains all nested integrals over elements of the original differential ring. We exhibit the relations satisfied by generalized evaluations of products of nested integrals. Investigating these relations of constants, we characterize in terms of Lyndon words certain evaluations of products that determine all others. We also analyze the relation of the free integro-differential ring with the shuffle algebra. To preserve integrals in the original differential ring for computations in its integro-differential closure, we introduce the notion of quasi-integro-differential rings and give two adapted constructions of the integro-differential closure. Finally, in a given integro-differential ring, we consider the internal integro-differential closure of a differential subring and identify it as quotient of the free integro-differential ring by certain constants.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Freudenthal triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We realize that the equations of the key varieties can be described conceptually by Freudenthal triple systems (FTS, for short). The paper consists of two parts. In Part 1, we revisit the general theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions of so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description of key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in FTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a $14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of codimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal singularities, and we construct examples of prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted projectivization of $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation between $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety, which is a key variety for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].</description>

      <title>On the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. Along the way, we prove the irreducibility criteria for the so-called ``induced modules'' of the BMS$_3$ algebra (which we prefer to call massive modules to avoid ambiguity) and show that this is the same criteria for the irreducibility of the Verma modules of the BMS$_3$ algebra. Interestingly, the modules generated by the action of the BCCA on the generating vector of the massive modules are also irreducible under the same criteria. When this criteria holds, every massive module decomposes into a direct sum of two BCCA-submodules, each of which we conjecture to be irreducible. Meanwhile, restricting Verma modules to the BCCA and $\mathcal{O}$ leads to free or ``almost free'' modules, which are not particularly interesting from a representation-theoretic viewpoint. This motivates the construction of BCCA modules intrinsically. To do this, we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra, using which we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</description>
