      <title>A $(\phi_n, \phi)$-Poincar\'e inequality on John domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^{n}$ with $n\ge2$, let $\phi $ is a Young function satisfying the doubling condition with the constant $K_\phi&lt;2^{n}$.
  If $\Omega$ is a John domain, we show that $\Omega $ supports a $(\phi_{n}, \phi)$-Poincar\'e inequality.
  Conversely, assume additionally that $\Omega$ is simply connected domain when $n=2$ or a bounded domain which is quasiconformally equivalent to some uniform domain when $n\ge3$. If $\Omega$ supports a $(\phi_n, \phi)$-Poincar\'e inequality, we show that it is a John domain.</description>

      <title>Automatic continuity of operator semigroups in the Calkin algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study operator semigroups in the Calkin algebra $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$, represented as a subalgebra of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space via one of `canonical' Calkin's representations. Using the BDF theory, we associate with any normal $C_0$-semigroup $(q(t))_{t\geq 0}$ in $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$ an extension $\Gamma\in\mathrm{Ext}(\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the inverse limit of certain compact metric spaces defined purely in terms of the spectrum $\sigma(A)$ of the generator of $(q(t))_{t\geq 0}$. Then we show that, in natural circumstances, if $(q(t))_{t\geq 0}$ is continuous in the strong operator topology, then it is actually uniformly continuous, although there are $C_0$-semigroups in $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$ that are not uniformly continuous.</description>

      <title>On some classes of Saphar type operators II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore additional properties of left Drazin invertible, essentially left Drazin invertible, right Drazin invertible, and essentially right Drazin invertible operators on Banach spaces, building upon the groundwork laid in [8] and [19]. Specifically, we propose alternative definitions for these operators and investigate their behavior in powers. Furthermore, we employ a specific operator decomposition to characterize these operators, providing a deeper understanding of their structure and properties. The operators we study are distinguished from other operators bearing the same name in existing literature, see [1], [9]. By employing more refined definitions, we uncover a broader range of properties for these operators, setting them apart from their counterparts in the literature.</description>

      <title>On noncommutative H\"older inequality of Sukochev and Zanin for weak Schatten class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sukochev and Zanin resolved an open problem due to B. Simon concerning optimal constants in H\"older inequality for the weak Schatten classes of compact operators. In this note we observe that these constants, by introducing the modified weak Schatten quasi-norms, can be renormalised so that the original Simon's conjecture (with optimal constant 1) does hold. We also provide an unexpectedly simple proof for the modified H\"older inequality and its sharpness.</description>

      <title>A remark on the distortion of twisted sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odell and Schlumprecht solved the distortion problem by proving that the classic sequence spaces $\ell_p$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ admit an inevitable biorthogonal system. In particular, these spaces are arbitrarily distortable. Later, Maurey extended the result to asymptotic $\ell_p$-spaces while Tomczak-Jaegermann did likewise for the Schatten classes. We observe that the Kalton-Peck spaces $Z_p$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ admit an inevitable biorthogonal system. Therefore, we may add this classic family to the list of arbitrarily distortable spaces.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$ spreading models and the FPP for Ces\`aro mean nonexpansive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty set in a Banach space $X$. A mapping $T\colon K\to K$ is called {\it $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive} if for any sequence $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $y$ in $K$, one has $\|(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n Tx_i -Ty\|\leq \|(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - y\|$. As a subsclass of nonexpansive maps, the FPP for such maps is well-established in a great variety of spaces. The main result of this paper is a fixed point result relating $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases with not-so-large basis constants. As a result, we deduce that every Banach space with weak Banach-Saks property has the fixed point property for $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.</description>

      <title>The Mercer-Young Theorem for Matrix-Valued Kernels on Separable Metric Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the characterization theorem going back to Mercer and Young, which states that a symmetric and continuous kernel is positive definite if and only if it is integrally positive definite. More precisely, we extend the result from real-valued kernels on compact intervals to matrix-valued kernels on separable metric spaces. We also demonstrate the applications of the generalized theorem to the field of convex optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore various equivalences of Ekeland's variational principle within the framework of group-invariant mappings. We introduce and analyze several key theorems, including the Drop theorem, the Petal theorem, Caristi-Kirk fxed-point theorem, and Takahashi's theorem, all of them within this context. Moreover, we extend the classical Drop theorem and Petal theorem to a more generalized setting. We also demonstrate the practical signifcance of these findings through numerous applications to diverse areas of mathematics. In particular, in the context of partial differential equations, we explore their implications on the solution of the Plateau problem, and in control theory. We also extend the classical Pontyargin maximum principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address a problem posed by F. Bayart regarding the existence of an infinite-dimensional closed vector subspace (excluding the null operator) within the set of supercyclic operators on Banach spaces. We resolve this problem by establishing the existence of the closed subspace. Furthermore, we prove that the set of supercyclic operators on $\ell_1$ contains, up to the null operator, an isometric copy of $\ell_1$.</description>

Abstract: A complex scalar k is said to be an extended eigenvalue of a bounded linear operator A on a complex Hilbert space if there is a nonzero operator X such that AX=kXA. There are some solutions to the problem of computing the extended eigenvalues for composition operators induced on the Fock space and Bergman space by linear fractional transformationsof the complex plane in this paper.</description>

      <title>Topological Vector Spaces: a non-standard approach with monads and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the overspill principle towards directed sets, a new and extensive formalism is developed for monads and galaxies in non-standard enlargements. It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using order-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties associated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all monads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is introduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally convex) topological vector spaces and their properties. Local properties and completeness can be defined and characterized effortlessly. Duality theory is studied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate brief and insightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck completeness without any technicalities.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact Riemannian manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ for which the trace operator from the first-order Sobolev space of mappings $\smash{\dot{W}}^{1, p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ to the fractional Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space $\smash{\smash{\dot{W}}^{1 - 1/p, p}} (\partial \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ is surjective when $1 &lt; p &lt; m$ are characterised. The traces are extended using a new construction which can be carried out assuming the absence of the known topological and analytical obstructions. When $p \ge m$ the same construction provides a Sobolev extension with linear estimates for maps that have a continuous extension, provided that there are no known analytical obstructions to such a control.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. This problem, which has a long history, has found applications in science and technology. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. To the best of our knowledge these fundamental issues have not received much attention. In particular, we present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP relative to these subsets. These conditions are related to the structure of the boundaries of the subsets, their relative orientation, and the structure of the unit sphere of the space. In addition, we present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP, possibly without convexity . Our results allow us to significantly extend the horizon of the recent alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke (A-S-HLWB) algorithm [Censor, Mansour and Reem, The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets, arXiv:2304.09600 (2023)] for solving the BAP problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stability under tensorization and projection-type operations of gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable vectors associated with a representation of a real Lie group on a Fr\'{e}chet space $E$ are quasinormable if $E$ is so. A similar result is shown to hold for the linear topological invariant $(\Omega)$. In the ultradifferentiable case, our results particularly apply to spaces of Gevrey vectors of Beurling type. As an application, we study the quasinormability and the property $(\Omega)$ for a broad class of Fr\'{e}chet spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable functions on Lie groups globally defined via families of weight functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such that $|f|=|g|$ on a set $A$. We first prove that there exists $c$ in the unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in $\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$. The same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and $A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not. We also provide sequential versions of the previous results and analyse the case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally we examine the situation when there is equality on two distinct circles in the disc, proving a result or counterexample for each possible configuration.</description>
