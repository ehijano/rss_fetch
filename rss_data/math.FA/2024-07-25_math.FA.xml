      <title>Pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions and Banach-Stone theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental properties of pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions between asymmetric spaces, which are the natural asymmetric counterpart of pointwise Lipschitz functions. We also study the influence that partial symmetries of a given space may have on the behavior of pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. Furthermore, we are interested in characterizing the pointwise semi-Lipschitz structure of an asymmetric space in terms of real-valued pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. By using two algebras of functions naturally associated to our spaces of pointwise real-valued semi-Lipschitz functions, we are able to provide two Banach-Stone type results in this context. In fact, these results are obtained as consequences of a general Banach-Stone type theorem of topological nature, stated for abstract functional spaces, which is quite flexible and can be applied to many spaces of continuous functions over metric and asymmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hilbert operators acting on weighted spaces of holomorphic functions with sup-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of the generalized Hilbert operator associated with a positive finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $[0,1)$ is investigated when it acts on weighted Banach spaces of holomorphic functions on the unit disc defined by sup-norms and on Korenblum type growth Banach spaces. It is studied when the operator is well defined, bounded and compact. To this aim, we study when it can be represented as an integral operator. We observe important differences with the behaviour of the Ces\`aro-type operator acting on these spaces, getting that boundedness and compactness are equivalent concepts for some standard weights. For the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disc and for the Wiener algebra, we get also this equivalence, which is characterized in turn by the summability of the moments of the measure $\mu.$ In the latter case, it is also equivalent to nuclearity. Nuclearity of the generalized Hilbert operator acting on related spaces, such as the classical Hardy space, is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Composition of locally solid convergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry on a more detailed investigation of the composition of locally solid convergences as introduced in \cite{ectv}, as well as the corresponding notion of idempotency considered in \cite{erz}. In particular, we study the interactions between these two concepts and various operations with convergences. Some results from \cite{kt} about unbounded modification of locally solid topologies are generalized to the level of locally solid idempotent convergences. A simple application of the composition allows us to answer a question from \cite{ectv} about minimal Hausdorff locally solid convergences. We also show that the weakest Hausdorff locally solid convergence exists on an Archimedean vector lattice if and only if it is atomic.</description>

      <title>On the Eldan-Gross inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <title>$(P,Q)$ complex hypercontractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be the standard normal random vector in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Under some mild growth and smoothness assumptions on any increasing $P, Q : [0, \infty) \mapsto [0, \infty)$ we show $(P,Q)$ complex hypercontractivity $$ Q^{-1}(\mathbb{E} Q(|T_{z}f(\xi)|))\leq P^{-1}(\mathbb{E}P(|f(\xi)|)) $$ holds for all polynomials $f:\mathbb{R}^{k} \mapsto \mathbb{C}$, where $T_{z}$ is the hermite semigroup at complex parameter $z, |z|\leq 1$, if and only if \begin{align*} \left|\frac{tP''(t)}{P'(t)}-z^{2}\frac{tQ''(t)}{Q'(t)}+z^{2}-1\right|\leq \frac{tP''(t)}{P'(t)}-|z|^{2}\frac{tQ''(t)}{Q'(t)}+1-|z|^{2} \end{align*} holds for all $t&gt;0$ provided that $F''&gt;0$, and $F'/F''$ is concave, where $F = Q\circ P^{-1}$. This extends Hariya's result from real to complex parameter $z$. Several old and new applications are presented for different choices of $P$ and $Q$. The proof uses heat semigroup arguments, where we find a certain map $C(s)$, which interpolates the inequality at the endpoints. The map $C(s)$ itself is composed of four heat flows running together at different times.</description>

      <title>H\"older-Continuity of Extreme Spectral Values of Pseudodifferential Operators, Gabor Frame Bounds, and Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on our recent results on the Lipschitz dependence of the extreme spectral values of one-parameter families of pseudodifferential operators with symbols in a weighted Sj\"ostrand class. We prove that larger symbol classes lead to H\"older continuity with respect to the parameter. This result is then used to investigate the behavior of frame bounds of families of Gabor systems $\mathcal{G}(g,\alpha\Lambda)$ with respect to the parameter $\alpha&gt;0$, where $\Lambda$ is a set of non-uniform, relatively separated time-frequency shifts, and $g\in M^1_s(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $0\leq s\leq 2$. In particular, we show that the frame bounds depend continuously on $\alpha$ if $g\in M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, and are H\"older continuous if $g\in M^1_s(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $0&lt;s\leq 2$, with the H\"older exponent explicitly given.</description>

      <title>An operator theory approach to the evanescent part of a two-parametric weak-stationary stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to the evanescent part of a two-dimensional weak-stationary stochastic process with the past given by a half-plane is proceed. The classical result due to Helson and Lowdenslager divides a two-parametric weak-stationary stochastic process into three parts. In this paper we describe the most untouchable one - the evanescent part. Moreover, we point out how this part depends on the shape of the past.</description>

      <title>Borell's inequality and mean width of random polytopes via discrete inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Borell's inequality states the existence of a positive absolute constant $C&gt;0$ such that for every $1\leq p\leq q$ $$ \left(\mathbb E|\langle X, e_n\rangle|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}\leq\left(\mathbb E|\langle X, e_n\rangle|^q\right)^\frac{1}{q}\leq C\frac{q}{p}\left(\mathbb E|\langle X, e_n\rangle|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}, $$ whenever $X$ is a random vector uniformly distributed in any convex body $K\subseteq\mathbb R^n$ containing the origin in its interior and $(e_i)_{i=1}^n$ is the standard canonical basis in $\mathbb R^n$. In this paper, we will prove a discrete version of this inequality, which will hold whenever $X$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on $K\cap\mathbb Z^n$ for any convex body $K\subseteq\mathbb R^n$ containing the origin in its interior. We will also make use of such discrete version to obtain discrete inequalities from which we can recover the estimate $\mathbb E w(K_N)\sim w(Z_{\log N}(K))$ for any convex body $K$ containing the origin in its interior, where $K_N$ is the centrally symmetric random polytope $K_N=\operatorname{conv}\{\pm X_1,\ldots,\pm X_N\}$ generated by independent random vectors uniformly distributed on $K$ and $w(\cdot)$ denotes the mean width.</description>

      <title>Isometric Representations of Calibrated Ordered Spaces on $C(X)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing normed ordered spaces which admit a representation in the algebraic, order and norm sense as a subspace of $C(X)$, the space of all continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space is a classical problem that has been considered by many authors. In this article we consider the more general case of calibrated ordered spaces, that is, ordered spaces with a specified family of seminorms generating its topology. For such spaces equivalent conditions on representability as a subspace of $C(X)$ for some locally compact Hausdorff space $X$, in the algebraic, order and seminorm sense are stated and proved. Some characterizations appear to be new even in the normed case. As an application of the main theorem, we state and prove a characterization of norm additivity property of two positive functionals.</description>

      <title>Invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work develops certain analytical tools required to construct and compute invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices. The main result is the $\mathrm{L}^1\,-$Godement theorem, which states that any invariant kernel, which is (in a certain natural sense) also integrable, can be computed by taking the inverse spherical transform of a positive function. General expressions for inverse spherical transforms are then provided, which can be used to explore new families of invariant kernels, at a rather moderate computational cost. A further, alternative approach for constructing new invariant kernels is also introduced, based on Ramanujan's master theorem for symmetric cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a smooth Banach manifold BV$([a,b], M)$ whose elements are suitably-defined functions $f:[a,b] \rightarrow M$ of bounded variation with values in a smooth Banach manifold $M$ which admits a local addition. If the target manifold is a Banach-Lie group $G$, with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we obtain a Banach-Lie group BV$([a,b], G)$ with Lie algebra BV$([a, b], \mathfrak{g})$. Strengthening known regularity properties of Banach-Lie groups, we construct a smooth evolution map from a Banach space of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued vector measures on $[0,1]$ to BV$([0,1],G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let S be a symmetric relation with deficiency index (1,1). In this article, we extend Krein`s resolvent formalism in order to describe all, not necessarily self-adjoint, extensions $S \subset \tilde{A}$ with $\varrho(\tilde{A})\neq \emptyset$. The corresponding $Q$-functions turn out to be quasi-Herglotz functions. We will use their structure to characterize the spectrum of such extensions. Finally, we also provide a model for such an extension on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space when $S$ is simple.</description>

      <title>Reduction of a nonlinear system and its numerical solution using a fractional iterative method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of 5 variables is numerically solved, which is derived from the application of the Fourier transform to a differential equation system that allows modeling the behavior of the temperatures and the efficiencies of a hybrid solar receiver, which in simple terms is the combination of a photovoltaic system with a thermoelectric system. In addition, a way to reduce the previous system to a nonlinear system of only 2 variables is presented. Naturally, reducing algebraic equation systems of dimension N to systems of smaller dimensions has the main advantage of reducing the number of variables involved in a problem, but the analytical expressions of the systems become more complicated. However, to minimize this disadvantage, an iterative method that does not explicitly depend on the analytical complexity of the system to be solved is used. A fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems is presented.</description>

Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>
