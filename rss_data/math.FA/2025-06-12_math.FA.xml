      <title>Higher-order affine Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zhang refined the classical Sobolev inequality $\|f\|_{L^{Np/(N-p)}} \lesssim \| \nabla f \|_{L^p}$, where $1\leq p \lt N$, by replacing $\|\nabla f\|_{L^p}$ with a smaller quantity invariant by unimodular affine transformations. The analogue result in homogeneous fractional Sobolev spaces $\mathring{W}^{s,p}$, with $0 \lt s \lt 1$ and $sp \lt N$, was obtained by Haddad and Ludwig. We generalize their results to the case where $s \gt 1$. Our approach, based on the existence of optimal unimodular transformations, allows us to obtain various affine inequalities, such as affine Sobolev inequalities, reverse affine inequalities, and affine Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete moduli of smoothness and their applications in one- and two- sided error estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new semi-discrete modulus of smoothness, which generalizes the definition given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako (KL) in 2023 (in the paper published in the J. Approx. Theory), and we establish very general one- and two- sided error estimates under non-restrictive assumptions. The proposed results have been proved exploiting the regularization and approximation properties of certain Steklov integrals introduced by Sendov and Popov in 1983, and differ from the ones given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako. In addition, the proof of the original KL approximation theorems were strictly related to the application of certain classical results of the trigonometric best approximation, and thus, they are applicable only for operators of the trigonometric type. By the definition of semi-discrete moduli of smoothness here proposed, we are able to deduce applications also for operators that are not necessarily of the trigonometric type, and can also be used to derive sharper estimates than those that can be achieved by the classical averaged moduli of smoothness ($\tau$-moduli). Furthermore, a Rathore-type theorem is established, and a new notion of K-functional is also introduced showing its equivalence with the semi-discrete modulus of smoothness and its realization. One-sided estimates of approximation can be established for classical operators on bounded domains, such as the Bernstein polynomials. In the case of approximation operators on the whole real line, one-sided estimates can be achieved, e.g., for the Shannon sampling (cardinal) series, as well as for the so-called generalized sampling operators. At the end of the paper, the case of algebraic Lagrange approximation has been considered, showing the main open problems in order to derive two-sided error estimates in this noteworthy case.</description>

      <title>Principled Approaches for Extending Neural Architectures to Function Spaces for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs), are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance, neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g., physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing. Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications. This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the steps to make neural operators work in practice.

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'etale groupoids: inverse semigroup disintegration and representations on $L^p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Banach algebras associated to twisted \'etale groupoids $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and to twisted inverse semigroup actions. This provides a unifying framework for numerous recent papers on $L^p$-operator algebras and the theory of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. We prove disintegrations theorems that allow to study Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ as universal Banach algebras generated by $C_0(X)$ and a twisted inverse semigroup $S$ of partial isometries subject to some relations. They work best when the target of a representation is a dual Banach algebra. For representations on dual Banach spaces, they allow to extend representations to twisted Borel convolution algebras, which is crucial when the groupoid is non-Hausdorff.
  We establish fundamental norm estimates and hierarchy for full and reduced $L^p$-operator algebras for $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and $p \in [1,\infty]$, whose special cases have been studied recently by Gardella-Lupini, Choi-Gardella-Thiel and Hetland-Ortega. We show that in the constructions of $L^p$-analogues of Cuntz or graph algebras, by Phillips and Corti\~{n}as-Rodr\'{\i}guez, the use of spatial partial isometries is not an assumption, in fact it is forced by the relations. We also introduce tight inverse semigroup Banach algebras that cover ample groupoid Banach algebras, and discuss Banach algebras associated to directed graphs.
  Our results cover non-Hausdorff \'{e}tale groupoids and both real and complex algebras. Some of the results are new already for complex $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new functional-analytic technique for investigating the degree of noncompactness of an operator defined on a quasinormed space and taking values in a Marcinkiewicz space. The main result is a general principle from which it can be derived that such operators are almost always maximally noncompact in the sense that their ball measure of noncompactness coincides with their operator norm. We point out specifications of the universal principle to the case of the identity operator.</description>

      <title>On the transcendentality condition for Gaussian Gabor frames and Hermite super/multiwindow frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a criterion for higher-dimensional Gaussian Gabor frames, which is a reformulation of one of the main results in in a previous article by the first and last authors in more explicit terms. We use this formulation in order to extend a result of Romero, Ulanovskii, and Zlotnikov to lattices given by irrational rotations. We also show that this density criterion for Gaussian Gabor frames is generic in a certain sense. In addition, we also extend the methods of the first and last named authors to the pseudoeffective threshold which gives a condition for uniqueness in the Bargmann-Fock space. We also use this viewpoint to study super and multi-window Gabor frames with Hermitian windows. In particular, we find a density criterion for transcendental lattices.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amenability of group actions on topological spaces generalizes amenability of groups and has applications in group theory, such as characterizing $C^{*}$--exact groups. We characterized it in terms of Banach algebras. For a topological group $G$ , group amenability can be characterized through the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if all derivations from $A$ to any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodules are inner. We extended this result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces, using a certain Banach algebra arising from the action and a weakened amenability condition of Banach algebras. We also proved a fixed point characterization of amenable actions, which improves the result by Dong and Wang (2015).</description>

      <title>Completeness of the space of absolutely and upper integrable functions with values in a semi-normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the absolute integrability of functions taking values in semi-normed spaces and locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS). We introduce an approach using upper integrals, inspired by previous work on integrals in these spaces. This method enables us to extend classical results from real-valued functions to LCTVS-valued functions.
  The paper demonstrates that the space of absolutely integrable functions forms a closed subspace within the framework of upper integrable functions. Additionally, we establish the completeness of these spaces, particularly for Fr\'echet spaces, using key tools such Fatou's lemma and Chebyshev's inequality.</description>

      <title>The Rank Ratio Function and the Radius of Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any given Cuntz semigroup, we introduce a function associated to it, called the ``Rank Ratio Function". This function ensures global control over the oscillation of the rank of any pair of elements in the Cuntz semigroup and, also, plays a very important role in computing the relative radii of comparison of the Cuntz semigroups. Along the way, as we study both the C*-algebraic and algebraic aspects of the relative radius of comparison with a deeper analysis, we introduce another function called the ``Radius of Comparison Function" which provides a method for manufacturing non-classifiable C*-algebras with different relative radii of comparison.</description>

      <title>Characterizations for arbitrary B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We precisely characterize the relationships between the reverse H\"older inequality, the Fujii-Wilson condition, the B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami $\mathrm{B}_p$ condition, the $\mathrm{B}_\infty$ condition, and the reverse Jensen inequality, for arbitrary weights in the unit disc. This is achieved by introducing new side conditions that turn out to be necessary and sufficient. The side conditions are simple and testable, and can be interpreted as integral versions of the much stronger condition of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, which has been considered earlier in the literature.</description>
