      <title>Deterministic Retrieval at Scale: Optimal-Space LCP Indexing and 308x Energy Reduction on Modern GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic top-k retrieval under Longest Common Prefix (LCP) similarity for N sequences of length L. We prove a tight Omega(N) space lower bound (cell-probe model) and present a trie-based index using O(N*L) space with O(L+k) query time. We contrast this with pairwise materialization (Theta(N^2)), which hits a practical OOM wall at scale, while our indexed approach remains O(N) in memory. We then introduce Thermal-Aware Logic (TAL), which turns prefix structure into range-bounded scans. In hardware measurements, TAL reduces energy per query by 308x (0.0145 J vs 4.46 J) and cuts p95 latency by 329x (0.114 ms vs 37.5 ms) on a 20M-item range-scan benchmark, while sustaining near-peak utilization (~99%) under long runs. The result is a deterministic retrieval primitive with receipts in regimes where approximate methods are unacceptable.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for the Drone Delivery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely delivery and optimal routing remain fundamental challenges in the modern logistics industry. Building on prior work that considers single-package delivery across networks using multiple types of collaborative agents with restricted movement areas (e.g., drones or trucks), we examine the complexity of the problem under structural and operational constraints. Our focus is on minimizing total delivery time by coordinating agents that differ in speed and movement range across a graph. This problem formulation aligns with the recently proposed Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT), introduced by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022].
  We first resolve an open question posed by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022] by showing that even when the delivery network is a path graph, DDT admits no polynomial-time approximation within any polynomially encodable factor $a(n)$, unless P=NP. Additionally, we identify the intersection graph of the agents, where nodes represent agents and edges indicate an overlap of the movement areas of two agents, as an important structural concept. For path graphs, we show that DDT becomes tractable when parameterized by the treewidth $w$ of the intersection graph, and we present an exact FPT algorithm with running time $f(w)\cdot\text{poly}(n,k)$, for some computable function $f$. For general graphs, we give an FPT algorithm with running time $f(\Delta,w)\cdot\text{poly}(n,k)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the intersection graph. In the special case where the intersection graph is a tree, we provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Solutions for Longest Common Subsequence Related Problems Between a Sequence and a Pangenome Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pangenome captures the genetic diversity across multiple individuals simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive reference for genome analysis than a single linear genome, which may introduce allele bias. A widely adopted pangenome representation is a node-labeled directed graph, wherein the paths correspond to plausible genomic sequences within a species. Consequently, evaluating sequence-to-pangenome graph similarity constitutes a fundamental task in pangenome construction and analysis. This study explores the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem and three of its variants involving a sequence and a pangenome graph. We present four polynomial-time reductions that transform these LCS-related problems into the longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These reductions demonstrate that all four problems can be solved in polynomial time, establishing their membership in the complexity class P.</description>

      <title>Tight FPT Approximations for Fair $k$-center with Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-center problem is a fundamental clustering objective that has been extensively studied in approximation algorithms. Recent work has sought to incorporate modern constraints such as fairness and robustness, motivated by biased and noisy data. In this paper, we study fair $k$-center with outliers, where centers must respect group-based representation constraints while up to $z$ points may be discarded.
  While a bi-criteria FPT approximation was previously known, no true approximation algorithm was available for this problem. We present the first deterministic $3$-approximation algorithm running in fixed-parameter tractable time parameterized by $k$. Our approach departs from projection-based methods and instead directly constructs a fair solution using a novel iterative ball-finding framework, based on a structural trichotomy that enables fixed-parameter approximation for the problem.
  We further extend our algorithm to fair $k$-supplier with outliers and to the more general fair-range setting with both lower and upper bounds. Finally, we show that improving the approximation factor below $3$ is $\mathrm{W[2]}$-hard, establishing the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>A Structural Equivalence of Symmetric TSP to a Constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief structural equivalence between the symmetric TSP and a constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem (cGSTP) defined on a simplicial incidence graph. Given the complete weighted graph on the city set V, we form the bipartite incidence graph between triangles and edges. Selecting an admissible, disk-like set of triangles induces a unique boundary cycle. With global connectivity and local regularity constraints, maximizing net weight in the cGSTP is exactly equivalent to minimizing the TSP tour length.</description>

      <title>Improved SDP-Based Algorithm for Coloring 3-Colorable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm that colors any 3-colorable $n$-vertex graph using $O(n^{0.19539})$ colors, improving upon the previous best bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{0.19747})$ by Kawarabayashi, Thorup, and Yoneda [STOC 2024]. Our result constitutes the first progress in nearly two decades on SDP-based approaches to this problem.
  The earlier SDP-based algorithms of Arora, Chlamt\'a\v{c}, and Charikar [STOC 2006] and Chlamt\'a\v{c} [FOCS 2007] rely on extracting a large independent set from a suitably "random-looking" second-level neighborhood, under the assumption that the KMS algorithm [Karger, Motwani, and Sudan, JACM 1998] fails to find one globally. We extend their analysis to third-level neighborhoods. We then come up with a new vector $5/2$-coloring, which allows us to extract a large independent set from some third-level neighborhood. The new vector coloring construction may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hashing: Faster Hash Functions with Fewer Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hash tables are ubiquitous, and the choice of hash function, which maps a key to a bucket, is key to their performance. We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognized, one may specify a hash function more tailored to some assumed key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case this assumption does not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance, as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys \emph{and} faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API. The experiments show that the adaptive approach marries the common-case performance of weak hash functions with the robustness of general-purpose ones.</description>

      <title>Competitive Analysis of Online Facility Assignment Algorithms on Discrete Grid Graphs: Performance Bounds and Remediation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the \emph{Online Facility Assignment} (OFA) problem on a discrete $r\times c$ grid graph under the standard model of Ahmed, Rahman, and Kobourov: a fixed set of facilities is given, each with limited capacity, and an online sequence of unit-demand requests must be irrevocably assigned upon arrival to an available facility, incurring Manhattan ($L_1$) distance cost. We investigate how the discrete geometry of grids interacts with capacity depletion by analyzing two natural baselines and one capacity-aware heuristic. First, we give explicit adversarial sequences on grid instances showing that purely local rules can be forced into large competitive ratios: (i) a capacity-sensitive weighted-Voronoi heuristic (\textsc{CS-Voronoi}) can suffer cascading \emph{region-collapse} effects when nearby capacity is exhausted; and (ii) nearest-available \textsc{Greedy} (with randomized tie-breaking) can be driven into repeated long reassignments via an \emph{oscillation} construction. These results formalize geometric failure modes that are specific to discrete $L_1$ metrics with hard capacities. Motivated by these lower bounds, we then discuss a semi-online extension in which the algorithm may delay assignment for up to $\tau$ time steps and solve each batch optimally via a min-cost flow computation. We present this batching framework as a remediation strategy and delineate the parameters that govern its performance, while leaving sharp competitive guarantees for this semi-online variant as an open direction.</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification Persists under Unlimited Synthetic Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Linear Systems and Eigenvalue Problems: Open Questions from a Simons Workshop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents a series of open questions arising in matrix computations, i.e., the numerical solution of linear algebra problems. It is a result of working groups at the workshop \emph{Linear Systems and Eigenvalue Problems}, which was organized at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing program on \emph{Complexity and Linear Algebra} in Fall 2025. The complexity and numerical solution of linear algebra problems %in matrix computations and related fields is a crosscutting area between theoretical computer science and numerical analysis. The value of the particular problem formulations here is that they were produced via discussions between researchers from both groups.
  The open questions are organized in five categories: iterative solvers for linear systems, eigenvalue computation, low-rank approximation, randomized sketching, and other areas including tensors, quantum systems, and matrix functions.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\alpha$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (\alpha-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\Omega( \frac{n^2}{2^\alpha} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\Omega( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</description>

      <title>Location-Aware Dispersion on Anonymous Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.
  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.</description>

      <title>Modern Minimal Perfect Hashing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $S$ of $n$ keys, a perfect hash function for $S$ maps the keys in $S$ to the first $m \geq n$ integers without collisions. It may return an arbitrary result for any key not in $S$ and is called minimal if $m = n$. The most important parameters are its space consumption, construction time, and query time. Years of research now enable modern perfect hash functions to be extremely fast to query, very space-efficient, and scale to billions of keys. Different approaches give different trade-offs between these aspects. For example, the smallest constructions get within 0.1% of the space lower bound of $\log_2(e)$ bits per key. Others are particularly fast to query, requiring only one memory access. Perfect hashing has many applications, for example to avoid collision resolution in static hash tables, and is used in databases, bioinformatics, and stringology.
  Since the last comprehensive survey in 1997, significant progress has been made. This survey covers the latest developments and provides a starting point for getting familiar with the topic. Additionally, our extensive experimental evaluation can serve as a guide to select a perfect hash function for use in applications.</description>

      <title>Constructing self-referential instances for the clique problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose constructing self-referential instances to reveal the inherent algorithmic hardness of the clique problem. First, we prove the existence of a phase transition phenomenon for the clique problem in the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph model and derive an exact location for the transition point. Subsequently, at the transition point, we construct a family of graphs. In this family, each graph shares the same number of vertices, number of edges, and degree sequence, yet both instances containing a $k$-clique and instances without any $k$-clique are included. These two states can be transformed into each other through a symmetric transformation that preserves the degree of every vertex. This property explains why exhaustive search is required in the critical region: an algorithm must search nearly the entire solution space to determine the existence of a solution; otherwise, a counterinstance can be constructed from the original instance using the symmetric transformation. Finally, this paper elaborates on the intrinsic reason for this phenomenon from the independence of the solution space.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description>
