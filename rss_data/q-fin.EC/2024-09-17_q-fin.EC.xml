      <title>Replicating The Log of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document replicates the main results from Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006 in R. The original results were obtained in TSP back in 2006. The idea here is to be explicit regarding the conceptual approach to regression in R. For most of the replication I used base R without external libraries except when it was absolutely necessary. The findings are consistent with the original article and reveal that the replication effort is minimal, without the need to contact the authors for clarifications or incur into data transformations or filtering not mentioned in the article.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the state-space model of unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a knowledge operator based on the agent's possibility correspondence which preserves her non-trivial unawareness within the standard state-space model. Our approach may provide a solution to the classical impossibility result that 'an unaware agent must be aware of everything'.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Public Cash Transfer Programs on US Entrepreneurs' Financing Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I conduct a policy exercise about how much the introduction of a cash transfer program as large as a Norwegian-sized lottery sector to the United States would affect startups. The key results are that public cash transfer programs (like lottery) do not increase much the number of new startups, but increase the size of startups, and only modestly increase aggregate productivity and output. The most important factor for entrepreneurs to start new businesses is their ability.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing Bitcoin users' balance distribution, we observed that it follows a log-normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application of Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for the log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule alone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin users' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor" and ``wealthy" users. Poor users, who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start, tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin users' behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.</description>

      <title>Course-Skill Atlas: A national longitudinal dataset of skills taught in U.S. higher education curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher education plays a critical role in driving an innovative economy by equipping students with knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. While researchers and practitioners have developed data systems to track detailed occupational skills, such as those established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), much less effort has been made to document which of these skills are being developed in higher education at a similar granularity. Here, we fill this gap by presenting Course-Skill Atlas -- a longitudinal dataset of skills inferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand U.S. higher education institutions. To construct Course-Skill Atlas, we apply natural language processing to quantify the alignment between course syllabi and detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe occupations. We then aggregate these alignment scores to create skill profiles for institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale representation of college education's role in preparing students for the labor market. Overall, Course-Skill Atlas can enable new research on the source of skills in the context of workforce development and provide actionable insights for shaping the future of higher education to meet evolving labor demands, especially in the face of new technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal In-Kind Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a model of in-kind redistribution where consumers participate in either a private market or a government-designed program, but not both. We characterize when a social planner, seeking to maximize weighted total surplus, can strictly improve upon the laissez-faire outcome. We show that the optimal mechanism consists of three components: a public option, nonlinear subsidies, and laissez-faire consumption. We quantify the resulting distortions and relate them to the correlation between consumer demand and welfare weights. Our findings reveal that while private market access constrains the social planner's ability to redistribute, it also strengthens the rationale for non-market allocations.</description>
