      <title>Is directed percolation class for synchronization transition robust with multi-site interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled map lattice with pairwise local interactions is a well-studied system. However, in several situations, such as neuronal or social networks, multi-site interactions are possible. In this work, we study the coupled Gauss map in one dimension with 2-site, 3-site, 4-site and 5-site interaction. This coupling cannot be decomposed in pairwise interactions. We coarse-grain the variable values by labeling the sites above $x^{\star}$ as up spin (+1) and the rest as down spin (-1) where $x^{\star}$ is the fixed point. We define flip rate $F(t)$ as the fraction of sites $i$ such that $s_{i}(t-1) \neq s_{i}(t)$ and persistence $P(t)$ as the fraction of sites $i$ such that $s_{i}(t')=s_{i}(0)$ for all $t' \le t$. The dynamic phase transitions to a synchronized state is studied above quantifiers. For 3 and 5 sites interaction, we find that at the critical point, $F(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$ with $\delta=0.159$ and $P(t) \sim t^{-\theta}$ with $\theta=1.5$. They match the directed percolation (DP) class. Finite-size and off-critical scaling is consistent with DP class. For 2 and 4 site interactions, the exponent $\delta$ and behavior of $P(t)$ at critical point changes. Furthermore, we observe logarithmic oscillations over and above power-law decay at the critical point for 4-site coupling. Thus multi-site interactions can lead to new universality class(es).</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional transverse-field $XY$ model with the in-plane anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction: Anisotropy-driven transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin-$S=1/2$ $XY$ model with the transverse-field $H$, in-plane-anisotropy $\gamma$, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) $D$ interactions was investigated by means of the exact diagonalization method, which enables us to treat the $D$-mediated complex-valued Hermitian matrix elements. According to the preceding real-space renormalization group analysis at $H=0$, the $\gamma$-driven phase transition occurs generically for $D\ne 0$ in contrast to the 1D $XY$ model where both $\gamma$- and $D$-induced phases are realized for $\gamma&gt;D$ and $ \gamma &lt;D$, respectively. In this paper, we evaluated the $\beta$ function $\beta(\gamma)$, namely, the differential of $\gamma$ with respect to the concerned energy scale, and from its behavior in proximity to $\gamma=0$, we observed an evidence of the $\gamma$-driven phase transition; additionally, $\gamma$'s scaling dimension is estimated from $\beta(\gamma)$'s slope. It was also determined how the value of the DM interaction influences the order-disorder phase boundary $H_c(\gamma)$ around the multi-critical point, $\gamma \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.</description>

      <title>Brownian-motion approach to statistical mechanics: Langevin equations, fluctuations, and timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>

      <title>Experimentally achieving minimal dissipation via thermodynamically optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport theory, originally developed in the 18th century for civil engineering, has since become a powerful optimization framework across disciplines, from generative AI to cell biology. In physics, it has recently been shown to set fundamental bounds on thermodynamic dissipation in finite-time processes. This extends beyond the conventional second law, which guarantees zero dissipation only in the quasi-static limit and cannot characterize the inevitable dissipation in finite-time processes. Here, we experimentally realize thermodynamically optimal transport using optically trapped microparticles, achieving minimal dissipation within a finite time. As an application to information processing, we implement the optimal finite-time protocol for information erasure, confirming that the excess dissipation beyond the Landauer bound is exactly determined by the Wasserstein distance - a fundamental geometric quantity in optimal transport theory. Furthermore, our experiment achieves the bound governing the trade-off between speed, dissipation, and accuracy in information erasure. To enable precise control of microparticles, we develop scanning optical tweezers capable of generating arbitrary potential profiles. Our work establishes an experimental approach for optimizing stochastic thermodynamic processes. Since minimizing dissipation directly reduces energy consumption, these results provide guiding principles for designing high-speed, low-energy information processing.</description>

      <title>Encounter-based model of a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic resetting on an encounter-based model of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined to the half-line $[0,\infty)$ with a partially absorbing wall at $x=0$. The RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha$ between the velocity states $\pm v$ with $v&gt;0$. Absorption occurs when the number of collisions with the wall (discrete local time) exceeds a randomly generated threshold $\widehat{\ell}$ with probability distribution $\Psi(\ell)$. The extended RTP model has three state variables, namely, particle position $X(t)\in [0,\infty)$, the velocity direction $\sigma(t)\in\{-1, 1\}$, and the discrete local time $L(t)\in {\mathbb N}$. We initially assume that only $X(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ reset at a Poisson rate $r$, whereas $L(t)$ is not changed. This implies that resetting is not governed by a renewal process. We use the stochastic calculus of jump processes to derive an evolution equation for the joint probability distribution of the triplet $(X(t),\sigma(t),L(t))$. This is then used to calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) by performing a discrete Laplace transform of the evolution equation with respect to the local time. We thus find that the MFPT's only dependence on the distribution $\Psi$ is via the mean local time threshold. We also identify parameter regimes in which the MFPT is a unimodal function of both the resetting and tumbling rates. Finally, we consider conditions under which resetting is given by a renewal process and show how the MFPT in the presence of local time resetting depends on the full statistics of $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-mediated adsorption versus absorption at partially reactive targets: a renewal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewal theory is finding increasing applications in non-equilibrium statistical physics. One example relates the probability density and survival probability of a Brownian particle or an active run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting to the corresponding quantities without resetting. A second example is so-called snapping out Brownian motion, which sews together diffusions on either side of an impermeable interface to obtain the corresponding stochastic dynamics across a semi-permeable interface. A third example relates diffusion-mediated surface adsorption-desorption (reversible adsorption) to the case of irreversible adsorption. In this paper we apply renewal theory to diffusion-mediated adsorption processes in which an adsorbed particle may be permanently removed (absorbed) prior to desorption. We construct a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and first passage time (FPT) density for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. We first consider the example of diffusion in a finite interval with a partially reactive target at one end. We use the renewal equations together with an encounter-based formalism to explore the effects of non-Markovian adsorption/desorption on the moments and long-time behaviour of the FPT density for absorption. We then analyse the corresponding renewal equations for a partially reactive semi-infinite trap and show how the solutions can be expressed in terms of a Neumann series expansion. Finally, we construct higher-dimensional versions of the renewal equations and derive general expression for the FPT density using spectral decompositions.</description>

      <title>An exact formula for the contraction factor of a subdivided Gaussian topological polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the radius of gyration of a Gaussian topological polymer $G$ formed by subdividing a graph $G'$ of arbitrary topology (for instance, branched or multicyclic). We give a new exact formula for the expected radius of gyration and contraction factor of $G$ in terms of the number of subdivisions of each edge of $G'$ and a new weighted Kirchhoff index for $G'$. The formula explains and extends previous results for the contraction factor and Kirchhoff index of subdivided graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect self-interacting processes, that is, stochastic processes where transitions depend on the time spent by a trajectory in each configuration, to Doob conditioning. In this way we demonstrate that Markov processes with constrained occupation measures are realised optimally by self-interacting dynamics. We use a tensor network framework to guide our derivations. We illustrate our general results with new perspectives on well-known examples of self-interacting processes, such as random walk bridges, excursions, and forced excursions.</description>

      <title>The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition and suppression of critical phase of thermofield double state in monitored quantum circuit with unitary $R$ matrix gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model when an overcrossings and undercrossing coincides. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by swap gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Semantic Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic problem of semantic compression is to minimize the length of a message while preserving its meaning. This differs from classical notions of compression in that the distortion is not measured directly at the level of bits, but rather in an abstract semantic space. In order to make this precise, we take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning and model semantic space as a continuous Euclidean vector space. In such a space, stimuli like speech, images, or even ideas, are mapped to high-dimensional real vectors, and the location of these embeddings determines their meaning relative to other embeddings. This suggests that a natural metric for semantic similarity is just the Euclidean distance, which is what we use in this work. We map the optimization problem of determining the minimal-length, meaning-preserving message to a spin glass Hamiltonian and solve the resulting statistical mechanics problem using replica theory. We map out the replica symmetric phase diagram, identifying distinct phases of semantic compression: a first-order transition occurs between lossy and lossless compression, whereas a continuous crossover is seen from extractive to abstractive compression. We conclude by showing numerical simulations of compressions obtained by simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, and argue that while the problem of finding a meaning-preserving compression is computationally hard in the worst case, there exist efficient algorithms which achieve near optimal performance in the typical case.</description>

      <title>Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Kelvin waves in nonequilibrium universal dynamics of relativistic scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

      <title>A projected complex Langevin sampling method for bosons in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.</description>

Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the novel conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimizing search processes in systems with state toggling: exact condition delimiting the efficacy of stochastic resetting strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Will the strategy of resetting} help a stochastic process to reach its target efficiently, with its environment continually toggling between a strongly favourable and an unfavourable (or weakly favourable) state? A diffusive run-and-tumble motion, transport of molecular motors on or off a filament, and motion under flashing optical traps are special examples of such state toggling. For any general process with toggling under Poisson reset, we derive a mathematical condition for continuous transitions where the advantage rendered by resetting vanishes. For the case of diffusive motion with linear potentials of unequal strength, we present exact solutions which reveal that there is quite generically a re-entrance of the advantage of resetting as a function of the strength of the strongly favourable potential. This result is shown to be valid for quadratic potential traps by using the general condition of transition.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of the free energy of mixed quantum-classical systems: coupling classical and electronic density functional theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations. This paper aims to develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation and serves as a starting point for further development. We therefore establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start with the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm quantum and N mm classical particles and, based on this, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities, thus generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional in order to explicitly make appear the eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state dynamics of stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental tool for training deep neural networks across a variety of tasks. In self-supervised learning, different input categories map to distinct manifolds in the embedded neural state space. Accurate classification is achieved by separating these manifolds during learning, akin to a packing problem. We investigate the dynamics of ``neural manifold packing'' by employing a minimal model in which SGD is applied to spherical particles in physical space. In this model, SGD minimizes the system's energy (classification loss) by stochastically reducing overlaps between particles (manifolds). We observe that this process undergoes an absorbing phase transition, prompting us to use the framework of biased random organization (BRO), a nonequilibrium absorbing state model, to describe SGD behavior. We show that BRO dynamics can be approximated by those of particles with linear repulsive interactions under multiplicative anisotropic noise. Thus, for a linear repulsive potential and small kick sizes (learning rates), we find that BRO and SGD become equivalent, converging to the same critical packing fraction $\phi_c \approx 0.64$, despite the fundamentally different origins of their noise. This equivalence is further supported by the observation that, like BRO, near the critical point, SGD exhibits behavior consistent with the Manna universality class. Above the critical point, SGD exhibits a bias towards flatter minima of the energy landscape, reinforcing the analogy with loss minimization in neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The site-decorated Ising model is introduced to advance the understanding and experimental realization of the recently discovered one-dimensional finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover in an external magnetic field, while mitigating the geometric complexities of traditional bond-decorated models. Furthermore, although higher-dimensional Ising models in an external field remain unsolved, an exact solution for a novel spin-reversal transition -- driven by an exotic, hidden ``half-ice, half-fire'' state induced by site decoration -- is derived. This transition, triggered by a slight variation in temperature or magnetic field even in the weak-field limit, offers a promising route toward energy-efficient applications such as data storage and processing. The results establish site decoration as a compelling new avenue for materials and device design, particularly in systems such as mixed $d$-$f$ compounds, optical lattices, and neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional athermal chiral active particles at high densities. The particles in this system perform the circular motion with frequency $\Omega$. We show that the system crystallizes at high densities even in two dimensions, accompanied by the true long-range translational order. This is due to the anomalous suppression of displacement fluctuations associated with hyperuniformity. These findings can be explained using an active elastic theory quantitatively. Surprisingly, the crystals become unstable and melt in the limit of $\Omega=0$, for the spatial dimension of four or less. This result can be explained by a mechanism akin to quenched random systems for which the lower critical dimension is four.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We show that the domain wall decays due to unstable order parameter fluctuations. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. During the first stage of the decay dynamics, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in a 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in a 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic degeneracy of ground state in the frustrated Heisenberg diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Exactly characterizing critical states: invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical state of disordered systems is an intriguing and popular topic in condensed matter physics, known for its non-ergodic properties such as multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-body interaction induced phase transitions and intermediate phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>
