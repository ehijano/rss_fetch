      <title>Exploring Three-Atom-Thick Gold Structures as a Benchmark for Atomic-Scale Calibration of Break-Junction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth study of electronic transport in atomic-sized gold contacts using Break-Junction (BJ) techniques under cryogenic and ambient conditions. Our experimental results, supported by classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and ab initio calculations, provide compelling evidence for the formation of three-atom-thick structures in gold nanocontacts under tensile stress. These findings extend previous studies that confirmed the existence of one- and two-atom-thick chains. Beyond identifying these novel atomic configurations, we introduce a fast and robust calibration method for Break-Junction systems, leveraging the characteristic length of these structures to convert piezo displacement into absolute distance in angstroms. Our approach presents a novel and robust method for calibrating atomic distances in atomic conductor systems at both cryogenic and room temperatures. The results also enable the assessment of electrode sharpness, even at room conditions.</description>

      <title>Cryogen-free low-temperature photoemission electron microscopy for high-resolution nondestructive imaging of electronic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials exhibit phases such as superconductivity at low temperatures, yet imaging their phase transition dynamics with high spatial resolution remains challenging due to conventional tools' limitations - scanning tunneling microscopy offers static snapshots, while transmission electron microscopy lacks band sensitivity. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) can resolve band structures in real/reciprocal spaces rapidly, but suffering from insufficient resolution for (near)atomic-scale quantum physics due to the unstable cooling designs. Here, we developed cryogen-free low-temperature PEEM (CFLT-PEEM) achieving 21.1 K stably. CFLT-PEEM attains a record-breaking resolution of 4.48 nm without aberration correction, enabling direct visualization of surface-state distribution characteristics along individual atomic steps. The advancement lies in narrowing the segment of band structures for imaging down to 160 meV, which minimizes the chromatic aberration of PEEM. CFLT-PEEM enables rapid, nondestructive high-resolution imaging of cryogenic electronic structures, positioning it as a powerful tool for physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Air-stable lithiation engineering of $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ for direct-bandgap multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its sizable direct bandgap and strong light-matter interactions, the preparation of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ has attracted significant attention and intensive research efforts. However, multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is largely overlooked because of its optically inactive indirect bandgap caused by interlayer coupling. It is highly desirable to modulate and decrease the interlayer coupling so that each layer in multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ can exhibit a monolayer-like direct-gap behavior. Here, we demonstrate the nanoprobe fabrication of $\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$-based multilayers exhibiting a direct bandgap and strong photoluminescence emission from tightly bound excitons and trions. The fabrication is facilitated by our newly developed Li-ion platform, featuring tip-induced Li intercalation, air stability and rewritability. Raman characterizations reveal that controlled Li intercalation effectively transforms multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ into the stack of multiple monolayers, leading to a 26-fold enhancement of photoluminescence, compared to a monolayer. This intercalation result is different from existing observations of transforming $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ multilayers into metallic phases.</description>

      <title>Field-driven band asymmetry and non-reciprocal transport in a helimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helimagnets exhibit noncollinear spin arrangements characterized by a periodic helical modulation, giving rise to emergent chiral properties. These materials have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in spintronics, particularly for robust information storage and the realization of topological spin textures such as skyrmions. In this work, we focus on Yoshimori-type helimagnets, where competing exchange interactions mediated by conduction electrons stabilize helical spin structures without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We introduce a minimal model describing the electronic structure of a one-dimensional helimagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field and investigate its impact on non-reciprocal transport. We demonstrate how band asymmetry emerges in the conical phase induced by the external field, leading to a nonzero second-order electronic conductivity and injection photoconductivity. Our results provide insight into the interplay between the real space magnetic texture and electronic properties, paving the way for future studies on chirality-driven transport phenomena in centrosymmetric helimagnets.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Nonlocality in Photonic Materials and Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Topological phenomena in artificial quantum materials revealed by local Chern markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Spin-Lattice Interaction Compatible with Discrete Translation Symmetry in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest in orbital angular momentum has led to a rapid expansion of research on spin-orbit coupling effects in solids, while also highlighting significant technical challenges. The breaking of rotational symmetry renders the orbital angular momentum operator ill-defined, causing conceptual and computational issues in describing orbital motion. To address these issues, here we propose an alternative framework. Based on the Bloch representation of the full relativistic interaction, we derive a field that directly couples to electron spins while preserving discrete translational symmetry, thereby eliminating the need for the position operator. Our approach is fully compatible with existing first-principles computational frameworks for both static and time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that this method offers a more effective description of the Edelstein and spin Hall effects compared to conventional orbital angular momentum formalisms.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional semiconductor-semimetal drag hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral charge transport of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system can be much influenced by feeding a current into another closely spaced 2D conductor, known as the Coulomb drag phenomenon -- a powerful probe of electron-electron interactions and collective excitations. Yet the materials compatible for such investigations remain limited to date. Especially, gapped 2D semiconductors with inherently large correlations over a broad gate range have been rarely accessible at low temperatures. Here, we show the emergence of a large drag response (drag resistance $R_{\text{drag}}$ at the order of k$\Omega$, with a passive-to-active drag ratio up to $\sim$ 0.6) in a semiconductor-semimetal hybrid, realized in a graphene-MoS$_{2}$ heterostructure isolated by an ultrathin 3 nm hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dielectric. We observe a crossover of $T$ to $T^{2}$ dependence of $R_{\text{drag}}$, separated by a characteristic temperature $T_{d} \sim E_{F}/k_{F}d$ ($d$ being the interlayer distance), in echo with the presence of a metal-insulator transition in the semiconducting MoS$_{2}$. Interestingly, the current nanostructure allows the decoupling of intralayer interaction-driven drag response by varying density in one layer with that in the other layer kept constant. A large Wigner-Seitz radius $r_{s}$ ($&gt;$ 10 within the density range of 1 to $4 \times 10^{12}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) in the massive Schr\"odinger carriers in MoS$_{2}$ is thus identified to dominate the quadratic dependence of total carriers in the drag system, while the massless Dirac carriers in graphene induce negligible drag responses as a function of carrier density. Our findings establish semiconductor-semimetal hybrid as a platform for studying unique interaction physics in Coulomb drag systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of Chern insulators in moire rhombohedral heptalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Extended Haldane model -- a modern gateway to topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal Haldane model brings up a paradigm beyond the quantum Hall effect to look for a plethora of topological phases in the honeycomb and other lattices. Here we dwell into this model considering a full parameter space in the presence of spin-orbit interaction as well as Zeeman field such that the flavour of Kane-Mele model is invoked. Adopting this extended Haldane model as an example, we elucidate, in a transparent manner, a number of topological features in a pedagogical manner. First, we describe various first order topological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining various anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the extended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order topological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the anisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model. At the end, we discuss various open issues involving \textcolor{black}{emergent or extended} symmetries that might lead to a broader understanding of various topological phases and the associated criteria behind their emergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous scientific phenomenon in various physical systems. Here, we examine the feasibility of generating multistable and dynamically tunable synchronization by using the technique of Floquet engineering. Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us not only to explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic topology wherein the phase trajectories have a nontrivial winding number and giant non-reciprocity. This scheme could help to elucidate the dynamics of complicated oscillator networks like biological systems and to mimic their highly efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>Interfacial strong coupling and negative dispersion of propagating polaritons in freestanding oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.</description>

      <title>Conductance, continuity, and ferromagnetic percolation thresholds in thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical percolation models predict the metal-insulator transition and the onset of the long-range ferromagnetic order at the same topological continuity threshold. We tested this prediction in thin films of ferromagnetic CoPd and found a dramatic difference between the conductance and magnetic thresholds. While the long-range ferromagnetic phase develops at or very close to the continuity threshold, the transition from the metal-like to insulator-like conductance develops in films several times thinner. We argue that atomically narrow low resistance gaps intersecting the fractal network of metallic clusters provide a consistent explanation of the effect. We identify the conduction threshold as the point in discontinuous films at which the resistance of intergranular junctions exceeds the quantum resistance mark.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <title>Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic scale study of lateral dynamics of Sn-intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of Sn intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC was investigated with a frozen-in diffusion front using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. The technique allows to laterally distinguish between intercalated regions and the pristine buffer layer. Comparing topography features with the surface potential on the mesoscopic scale confirms that surface steps act as transport barriers. The results show a distinct pin hole mechanism for the material flow from terrace to terrace of the vicinal substrate surface. Nucleation and the formation of tin intercalated phase on terraces happen at steps. This results in a mesoscopic growth against the macroscopic diffusion direction.</description>

      <title>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J &lt; 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Impact of charge transfer excitons on unidirectional exciton transport in lateral TMD heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral heterostructures built of monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by a thin 1D interface exhibiting a large energy offset. Recently, the formation of spatially separated charge-transfer (CT) excitons at the interface has been demonstrated. The technologically important exciton propagation across the interface and the impact of CT excitons has remained in the dark so far. In this work, we microscopically investigate the spatiotemporal exciton dynamics in the exemplary hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ lateral heterostructure and reveal a highly interesting interplay of energy offset-driven unidirectional exciton drift across the interface and efficient capture into energetically lower CT excitons at the interface. This interplay triggers a counterintuitive thermal control of exciton transport with a less efficient propagation at lower temperatures - opposite to the behavior in conventional semiconductors. We predict clear signatures of this intriguing exciton propagation both in far- and near-field photoluminescence experiments. Our results present an important step toward a microscopic understanding of the technologically relevant unidirectional exciton transport in lateral heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.</description>

      <title>Robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls for solar-driven H$_2$ generation and storage</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen gas is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its high energy output and environmentally safe byproducts. Various morphologies of photocatalytic materials have been explored for high-efficiency H$_2$ production, for instance, quasi-1D nanoscroll structures that provide larger surface-to-volume ratio. Recently, we predicted layer-by-layer formation of stable oxide nanoscrolls directly from dichalcogenide precursors, eliminating the need for costly formation of two-dimensional oxides for a roll-up synthesis of nanoscrolls. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of those oxide nanoscroll materials MoO$_3$, WO$_3$, PdO$_2$, HfO$_2$, and GeO$_2$ for solar-driven photocatalytic H$_2$ production and storage. Using excited state theory simulations we discern their electronic properties as a function of interlayer scroll spacing and find them to possess electronic properties that are suitable for photocatalysis. Additionally, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that they are also suitable for H$_2$ storage as the nanoscrolls exhibit effective trapping of hydrogen, even in the presence of defects and vacancies in the oxides. This work thus demonstrates the discovery of robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls as novel materials for advancing solar-driven hydrogen technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>

Abstract: We compute the longitudinal conductivity for a wide class of two-dimensional tight-binding models, whose Hamiltonian displays conical intersections of the Bloch bands at the Fermi level. Our setting allows to consider generic transitions between quantum Hall phases. We obtain an explicit expression for the longitudinal conductivity, completely determined by the number of conical intersections and by the shape of the cones. In particular, the formula reproduces the known quantized values obtained for graphene and for the critical Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Ballistic electron transport described by a fourth order Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fourth order Schr\"odinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schr\"odinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler, where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the effective mass approximation.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Growth dynamics of graphene buffer layer formation on ultra-smooth SiC(0001) surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study the growth process of epitaxial graphene on SiC was investigated systematically. The transition from the initial buffer layer growth to the formation of the first monolayer graphene domains was investigated by various techniques: atomic force microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, low energy electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data show that the buffer layer formation goes along with a simultaneous SiC decomposition which takes place as a rapid step retraction of one specific type of SiC bilayer in good agreement with the step retraction model. Once the buffer layer coverage is completed, the resulting characteristic regular repeating terrace and step height pattern of one and two SiC bilayers turned out to be very stable against further SiC decomposition. The following initial growth of monolayer graphene domains occurs, interestingly, only along the two bilayer high terrace edges. This behavior is explained by a preferential SiC decomposition at the higher step edges and it has some potential for spatial graphene growth control. The corresponding earlier graphene growth on one terrace type can explain the different scanning tunneling spectroscopy nanoscale resistivities on these terraces.</description>

Abstract: Single electrons confined to a free neon surface and manipulated through the circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) architecture is a promising novel quantum computing platform. Understanding the exact physical nature of the electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states is important for realizing this platform's potential for quantum technologies. We investigate how resonator trench depth and substrate surface properties influence the formation of eNe charge states and their coupling to microwave resonators. Through experimental observation supported by modeling, we find that shallow-depth etching of the resonator features maximizes coupling strength. By comparing the trapping statistics and surface morphology of devices with altered trench roughness, our work reveals the role of fabrication-induced surface features in the formation of strongly coupled eNe states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals can emerge from Dirac semimetals when the time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken. Recently, it has been proposed based on the Floquet theory that Dirac semimetals can be converted into Weyl semimetals even by shining circularly polarized light (CPL). Here we have investigated the possibility of such a Dirac-Weyl conversion by measuring the CPL-induced anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in the paramagnetic phase using ultrafast mid-infrared pump-terahertz Faraday rotation probe spectroscopy. We find that the field-strength and driving frequency dependence of the observed AHC is well accounted for by CPL-induced nonzero Berry curvature associated with the splitting of the Dirac bands as predicted by the Floquet theory. The estimated splitting of the Dirac bands reaches about 60 % of the mass gap and the calculated CPL-induced AHC quantitatively reproduces the experimental observation, demonstrating a promising route toward the realization of Floquet-Weyl states from massive Dirac semimetals.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear lattice models can support "discrete breather" excitations that stay localized in space for all time. By contrast, the localized Wannier states of linear lattice models are dynamically unstable. Nevertheless, symmetric and exponentially localized Wannier states are a central tool in the classification of band structures with crystalline symmetries. Moreover, the quantized transport observed in nonlinear Thouless pumps relies on the fact that -- at least in a specific model -- discrete breathers recover Wannier states in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the correspondence between nonlinear breathers and exponentially localised Wannier states for a family of discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with crystalline symmetries. We develop a formalism to analytically predict the breathers' spectrum, center of mass and symmetry data, and apply this to nonlinear generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and the breathing kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Integration of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits in 3D cavity</title>

Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into circuit quantum electrodynamics (c-QED) devices is an emerging filed in recent years. This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.</description>

      <title>Thermopower probing emergent local moments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) have revealed the formation of flatbands, suggesting that correlation effects are likely to dominate in this system. Yet, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations like local moments arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower as a sensitive global transport probe for measuring entropy, we unveil the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy. Remarkably, in addition to sign changes at the Dirac point ($\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower of MATBLG demonstrates additional sign changes at the location, $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$, which do not vary with temperature from $5K$ to $\sim 60K$. This is in contrast to sensitive temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Further, we have investigated the effect of magnetic field ($B$) on the thermopower, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$. Our results show a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, that is consistent with suppression seen in the layered oxide due to the partial polarization of the spin entropy. The observed robust crossing points, together with suppression in a magnetic field, cannot be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flatband.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Tuning of Single-Photon Emission in Monolayer WSe2 via Localized Strain Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment in a honeycomb ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment is theoretically investigated in a honeycomb ferromagnet, whose Hamiltonian contains the Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, the Kitaev, and the Zeeman interactions. More specifically, we obtain the magnon band structure, the Berry curvature, the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature, and the magnon orbital moment Nernst conductivity (MOMNC) for the Hamiltonian within the linear spin-wave theory in the polarized phase. We found the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature is largely independent of the sign of the Chern number of the band. For an experimental proposal, we estimate MOMNC of $\mathrm{CrI}_{3}$ for the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-Zeeman model and Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-Zeeman model for a perpendicular external magnetic field. We found that certain Kitaev materials provide us with a broad tunability of the MOMNC through a magnetic field. We envision that our findings lead to further investigations of the novel transport properties of the magnon orbital moment.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for spin chirality emerging from itinerant ferromagnets in bands with Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of strongly interacting electrons in bands with Berry curvature is a problem of wide interest. In this paper, we study this problem by numerically studying a fluxed Hubbard-type model on square lattice. Using this model, we demonstrate a metallic ferromagnet in electron bands equipped with Berry curvature can develop non-coplanar spin order in which spin polarization axes at different position span finite solid angles. We find spin chirality can emerge in this setting by doping or adding gauge flux on top of a collinear ferromagnet. This result supports the prediction of spin chirality occurring through an emergent spin orbital interaction. Meanwhile, our result shows that, on top a ferromagnetic background, the spin chirality emerges at a finite threshold value of orbital magnetization, resembling the predicted behavior in theory.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the fault-tolerant threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with &gt;99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We show that the domain wall decays due to unstable order parameter fluctuations. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. During the first stage of the decay dynamics, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in a 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in a 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior.</description>

Abstract: The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral Edge States in a Synthetic Dimension of Atomic Trap States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Exactly characterizing critical states: invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical state of disordered systems is an intriguing and popular topic in condensed matter physics, known for its non-ergodic properties such as multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Magnetic Coupling in MN4-Graphene via Strain Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, incorporating transition metal elements (M), represent a class of experimentally accessible two-dimensional materials with significant potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these systems, magnetic exchange interactions are primarily governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an anomalously prolonged decay of r to the power of (-n), where r is the M-M separation distance and n is between 0.5 and 2. This study investigates the impact of strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). A novel strain-engineering approach is developed by applying controlled tension or compression to the layers. Our findings reveal that strain significantly modulates the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling. Notably, the CoN4-G layer demonstrates a pronounced enhancement in RKKY coupling strength, oscillation amplitude, and reduced decay rate under strain. Conversely, the CuN4-G layer exhibits distinct behavior, maintaining decoupled spin chains and invariant electronic and magnetic properties despite applied strain. This work underscores the tunability of magnetic interactions in MN4-G layers via strain engineering, providing insights into the design of strain-controlled magnetic materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>
