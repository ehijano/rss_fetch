      <title>Triangular solutions to a Riemann-Hilbert problem from superelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give fundamental solutions of arbitrarily sized matrix Fuchsian linear systems, in the case where the coefficients $B^{(i)}$ of the systems are matrix solutions of the Schlesinger system that are upper triangular, and whose eigenvalues follow an arithmetic progression of a rational difference. The values on the superdiagonals of the matrices $B^{(i)}$ are given by contour integrals of meromorphic differentials defined on Riemann surfaces obtained by compactification of superelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>The index of a pair of pure states and the interacting integer quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the index $\mathcal{N}(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ of a pair of pure states on a unital C*-algebra, which is a generalization of the notion of the index of a pair of projections on a Hilbert space. We then show that the Hall conductance associated with an invertible state $\omega$ of a two-dimensional interacting electronic system which is symmetric under $U(1)$ charge transformation may be written as the index $\mathcal{N}(\omega,\omega_D)$, where $\omega_D$ is obtained from $\omega$ by inserting a unit of magnetic flux. This exhibits the integrality and continuity properties of the Hall conductance in the context of general topological features of $\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>From Kinetic Theory to AI: a Rediscovery of High-Dimensional Divergences and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting an appropriate divergence measure is a critical aspect of machine learning, as it directly impacts model performance. Among the most widely used, we find the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, originally introduced in kinetic theory as a measure of relative entropy between probability distributions. Just as in machine learning, the ability to quantify the proximity of probability distributions plays a central role in kinetic theory. In this paper, we present a comparative review of divergence measures rooted in kinetic theory, highlighting their theoretical foundations and exploring their potential applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Second Quantization for the Kepler Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler problem concerns a point particle in an attractive inverse square force. After a brief review of the classical and quantum versions of this problem, focused on their hidden $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$ symmetry, we discuss the quantum Kepler problem for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We show that the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of bound states for this problem is unitarily equivalent, as a representation of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$, to the Hilbert space of solutions of the Weyl equation on the spacetime $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. This equation describes a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We then form the fermionic Fock space on $\mathcal{H}$ and show this is unitarily equivalent to the Hilbert space of a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ free quantum field on $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$, again as representations of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$. By modifying the Hamiltonian of this free field theory, we obtain the well-known "Madelung rules". These give a reasonable approximation to the observed filling of subshells as we consider elements with more and more electrons, and match the rough overall structure of the periodic table.</description>

      <title>The stability of long-range order in disordered systems: A generalized Ding-Zhuang argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of long-range order against quenched disorder is a central problem in statistical mechanics. This paper develops a generalized framework extending the Ding-Zhuang method and integrated with the Pirogov-Sinai framework, establishing a systematic scheme for studying phase transitions of long-range order in disordered systems. We axiomatize the Ding-Zhuang approach into a theoretical framework consisting of the Peierls condition and a local symmetry condition. For systems in dimensions $d \geq 3$ satisfying these conditions, we prove the persistence of long-range order at low temperatures and under weak disorder, with multiple coexisting distinct Gibbs states. The framework's versatility is demonstrated for diverse models, providing a systematic extension of Peierls methods to disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic level maps and associated varieties of simple affine vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two cyclotomic level maps defined respectively on the set of nilpotent orbits $\underline{\mathcal{N}}$ in a complex semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and the set of conjugacy classes $\underline{W}$ in its Weyl group, with values in positive integers. We show that these maps are compatible under Lusztig's map $\underline{W} \to \underline{\mathcal{N}}$, which is also the minimal reduction type map as shown by Yun. We also discuss their relationship with two-sided cells in affine Weyl groups.
  We use these maps to formulate a conjecture on the associated varieties of simple affine vertex algebras attached to $\mathfrak{g}$ at non-admissible integer levels, and provide some evidence for this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>

      <title>Disordered pinning models with contact number constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called \emph{contacts}. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this \emph{big jump phenomenon} is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</description>

      <title>Generalized Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff Decomposition and a New Class of Higher Grading Integrable Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff decomposition that expands the standard integrable hierarchy formalism in two fundamental ways: it allows for integer powers of Lax matrix components in the flow equations to be increased as compared to conventional models, and it incorporates constant non-zero vacuum (background) solutions.
  Two additional parameters control these features. The first one defines the grade of a semisimple element that underpins the algebraic construction of the hierarchy, where a grade-one semi-simple element recovers known hierarchies such as mKdV and AKNS. The second parameter distinguishes between zero and non-zero constant background (vacuum) configurations.
  Additionally, we introduce a third parameter associated with an ambiguity in the definition of the grade-zero component of the dressing matrices. While not affecting the decomposition itself, this parameter classifies different gauge realizations of the integrable equations (like for example, Kaup-Newell, Gerdjikov-Ivanov, Chen-Lee-Liu models).
  For various values of these parameters, we construct and analyze corresponding integrable models in a unified universal manner demonstrating the broad applicability and generative power of the extended formalism.</description>

      <title>Higher spin Richardson-Gaudin model with time-dependent coupling: Exact dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary $s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>First critical field in the pinned three dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extreme type-II superconductors described by the three dimensional magnetic Ginzburg-Landau functional incorporating a pinning term $a_\varepsilon(x)$, which we assume to be a bounded measurable function satisfying $b\leq a_\varepsilon(x)\leq 1$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. A hallmark of such materials is the formation of vortex filaments, which emerge when the applied magnetic field exceeds the first critical field $H_{c_1}$. In this work, we provide a lower bound for this critical field and provide a characterization of the Meissner solution, that is, the unique vortexless configuration that globally minimizes the energy below $H_{c_1}$. Moreover, we show that the onset of vorticity is intrinsically linked to a weighted variant of the isoflux problem studied in [C. Rom\'an, On the First Critical Field in the Three Dimensional Ginzburg-Landau Model of Superconductivity, Comm. Math. Phys. 367 (2019), no.1, 317--349. arXiv:1802.09390] and [C. Rom\'an, \'E. Sandier and S. Serfaty, Bounded vorticity for the 3D Ginzburg-Landau model and an isoflux problem, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) 126 (2023), no.3, 1015--1062. arXiv:2110.06858]. A crucial role is played by the $\varepsilon$-level tools developed in [C. Rom\'an, Three dimensional vortex approximation construction and $\varepsilon$-level estimates for the Ginzburg-Landau functional, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 231 (2019), no.3, 1531--1614. arXiv:1712.07604], which we adapt to the weighted Ginzburg-Landau framework.</description>

Abstract: The cylindrical Hastings-Levitov$(0)$ admits a single infinite connected tree (arm). For a cylinder of width $N$, and particles of size $\lambda$, we consider the last time $\upsilon_{N, \lambda}$, that a finite tree receives a particle. We prove that $\frac{cN^2}{\lambda^3}&lt;\mathbb{E}[\upsilon_{N, \lambda}]&lt; \frac{CN^2}{\lambda^3}$. Furthermore, we establish an exponential tail for $\upsilon_{N, \lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing of Glauber Dynamics for Monotone Systems via Entropic Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on monotone systems. For monotone systems satisfying the entropic independence condition, we prove a new mixing time comparison result for Glauber dynamics. For concrete applications, we obtain $\tilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the random cluster model induced by the ferromagnetic Ising model with consistently biased external fields, and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ mixing time for the bipartite hardcore model under the one-sided uniqueness condition, where $n$ is the number of variables in corresponding models, improving the best known results in [Chen and Zhang, SODA'23] and [Chen, Liu, and Yin, FOCS'23], respectively.
  Our proof combines ideas from the stochastic dominance argument in the classical censoring inequality and the recently developed high-dimensional expanders. The key step in the proof is a novel comparison result between the Glauber dynamics and the field dynamics for monotone systems.</description>

      <title>The motion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid: new results for strong solutions, uniqueness and integrability properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show two results in the setting of Galdi-Silvestre strong solutions for the rigid body-viscous fluid interaction. The former, under an additional integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data, proves that the time derivative of the solution belongs to $L^2(0,T;L^2({\Omega}))$. The latter, thanks to a further assumption only on one solution, proves that the uniqueness holds in the quoted setting. However, our extra assumption for the uniqueness is certainly verified under the integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data. Hence, the set of solutions enjoying the uniqueness is not empty.</description>

      <title>Energy Balance and Optical Theorem for Time-Modulated Subwavelength Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave propagation through a one-dimensional array of subwavelength resonators with periodically time-modulated material parameters. Focusing on a high-contrast regime, we use a scattering framework based on Fourier expansions and scattering matrix techniques to capture the interactions between an incident wave and the temporally varying system. This way, we derive a formulation of the total energy flux corresponding to time-dependent systems of resonators. We show that the total energy flux is composed of the transmitted and reflected energy fluxes, and derive an optical theorem which characterises the energy balance of the system. We provide a number of numerical experiments to investigate the impact of the time-dependency, the operating frequency and the number of resonators on the maximal attainable energy gain and energy loss. Moreover, we show the existence of lasing points, at which the total energy diverges. Our results lay the foundation for the design of energy dissipative or energy amplifying systems.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of ground states to $L^2$-supercritical nonlinear Dirac equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and nonrelativistic limit of normalized ground states for the following nonlinear Dirac equation with power-type potentials \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} &amp;-i c\sum\limits_{k=1}^3\alpha_k\partial_k u +mc^2 \beta {u}- |{u}|^{p-2}{u}=\omega {u}, \\ &amp;\displaystyle\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\vert u \vert^2 dx =1.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} We demonstrate the existence of ground states for large $c$ and establish the uniqueness of the associated Lagrange multiplier for all $p \in (2,3)$. In particular, the case for $p \in (8/3, 3)$, often referred to as $L^2$-supercritical and posing significant challenges to existing methods, is primarily addressed in this paper. Furthermore, in the nonrelativistic limit as $c \to \infty$, we observe that the first two components of the Dirac ground states converge to Schr\"odinger ground states, while the last two components vanish for all $p\in (2,3)$. This convergence is related to the action of $SU(2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Witten conjecture through spectral curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Witten conjecture, which connects a descendent enumerative theory with a specific reduction of KP integrable hierarchy. Our conjecture is realized by two parts: Part I (Geometry) establishes a correspondence between the geometric descendent potential (apart from ancestors) and the topological recursion of specific spectral curve data $(\Sigma, x,y)$; Part II (Integrability) claims that the TR descendent potential, defined at the boundary points of the spectral curve (where $dx$ has poles), is a tau-function of a certain reduction of the multi-component KP hierarchy.
  In this paper, we show the geometric part of the conjecture for any formal descendent theory by using a generalized Laplace transform. Subsequently, we prove the integrability conjecture for the one-boundary cases. As applications, we generalize and prove the $r$KdV integrability of negative $r$-spin theory conjectured by Chidambaram, Garcia-Failde and Giacchetto. We also show the KdV integrability of the total descendent potential associated with the Hurwitz space $M_{1,1}$, whose Frobenius manifold was initially introduced by Dubrovin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider series over Young diagrams of products of Schur functions $s_{\lambda\cup\lambda}$, marked with ``fat partitions'' $\lambda\cup\lambda$, which appear in matrix models associated with ensembles of symplectic and orthogonal matrices and quaternion Ginibre ensembles. We consider mixed matrix models that also contain complex Ginibre ensembles labeled by graphs with corner matrices and the three ensembles mentioned above. Cases are identified when a series of perturbations in coupling constants turn out to be tau functions of the DKP hierarchy introduced by the Kyoto school. This topic relates matrix models to random partitions - discrete symplectic ensemble and its modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic representations $\Omega_{rs}$ of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ that depend upon two points $r,s$ in the chiral Potts algebraic curve. We show how $\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the tensor product $\rho_r\otimes \bar{\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator representation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the Q-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\tau_2$ models.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Schwarzian Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed defects in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>Isometries and isometric embeddings of Wasserstein spaces over the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15095v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose in this paper is to study isometries and isometric embeddings of the $p$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ over the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ for all $p&gt;1$ and for all $n\geq 1$. First, we create a link between optimal transport maps in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. Then we use this link to understand isometric embeddings of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}_+$ into $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ for $p&gt;1$. That is, we characterize complete geodesics and geodesic rays in the Wasserstein space. Using these results we determine the metric rank of $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$. Namely, we show that $\mathbb{R}^k$ can be embedded isometrically into $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ for $p&gt;1$ if and only if $k\leq n$. As a consequence, we conclude that $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{R}^k)$ and $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^k)$ can be embedded isometrically into $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ if and only if $k\leq n$. In the second part of the paper, we study the isometry group of $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ for $p&gt;1$. We find that these spaces are all isometrically rigid meaning that for every isometry $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)\to\mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{H}^n)$ there exists a $\psi:\mathbb{H}^n\to\mathbb{H}^n$ such that $\Phi=\psi_{\#}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2004.01871 Satake introduced the notions of admissible triplets and good basic invariants for finite complex reflection groups. For irreducible finite Coxeter groups, he showed the existence and the uniqueness of good basic invariants. Moreover he showed that good basic invariants are flat in the sense of K.Saito's flat structure. He also obtained a formula for the multiplication of the Frobenius structure. In this article, we generalize his results to finite complex reflection groups. We first study the existence and the uniqueness of good basic invariants. Then for duality groups, we show that good basic invariants are flat in the sense of the natural Saito structure constructed in arXiv:1612.03643. We also give a formula for the potential vector fields of the multiplication in terms of the good basic invariants. Moreover, in the case of irreducible finite Coxeter groups, we derive a formula for the potential functions of the associated Frobenius manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equation with particle-antiparticle interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equations with a focus on the behavior of zero at the boundaries of the spectral gap. We introduce a nonlinear particle-antiparticle interaction and demonstrate that the problem exhibits asymmetric behavior at the left and right boundaries of the spectrum. Specifically, when zero is at the right boundary, the problem has only trivial solutions and is identified as a bifurcation point on the left, whereas nontrivial solutions exist when zero is at the left boundary or within the spectral gap. The main idea is to employ a variational method involving a perturbation technique that places zero within the spectral gap. We use the critical point theorem of the perturbed functional to construct a Palais-Smale sequence in order to approach the critical point of the target energy functional. Additionally, we utilize the concentration-compactness principle to identify critical points of the original functional and explore the associated bifurcation phenomena. Our results reveal an asymmetric phenomenon in nonlinear quantum systems and provide insights into why strongly indefinite problems typically address zero only at the left boundary of the spectral gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating convex approximations of complex contact models, incorporating experimentally validated models like Hunt &amp; Crossley coupled with Coulomb's law of friction alongside the principle of maximum dissipation. Our approach is robust across a wide range of stiffness values, making it suitable for both compliant surfaces and rigid approximations. We evaluate these approximations across a wide variety of test cases, detailing properties and limitations. We implement a fully differentiable solution in the open-source robotics toolkit, Drake. Our novel hybrid approach enables computation of gradients for complex geometric models while reusing factorizations from contact resolution. We demonstrate robust simulation of robotic tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, supporting effective sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Positivity and universal Pl\"ucker coordinates for spaces of quasi-exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quasi-exponential is an entire function of the form $e^{cu}p(u)$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial and $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $V = \langle e^{h_1u}p_1(u), \dots, e^{h_Nu}p_N(u) \rangle$ be a vector space with a basis of quasi-exponentials. We show that if $h_1, \dots, h_N$ are nonnegative and all of the complex zeros of the Wronskian $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$ are real, then $V$ is totally nonnegative in the sense that all of its Grassmann-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates defined by the Taylor expansion about $u=t$ are nonnegative, for any real $t$ greater than all of the zeros of $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians $T_\lambda^G(t)$ introduced in [ALTZ14] are universal Pl\"ucker coordinates about $u=t$ for the Wronski map on spaces of quasi-exponentials. The result that $V$ is totally nonnegative follows from the fact that $T_\lambda^G(t)$ is positive semidefinite, which we establish using partial traces. We also show that if $h_1 = \cdots = h_N = 0$ then $T_\lambda^G(t)$ equals $\beta^\lambda(t)$, which is the universal Pl\"ucker coordinate for the Wronski map on spaces of polynomials introduced in [KP23].</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Markovianity via local quantum Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovianity in open quantum systems (OQSs) is gaining increasing attention due to its profound implications for quantum information processing. This phenomenon arises from the system's evolution being influenced by its previous interactions with the environment. To better understand these complex dynamics, various measures have been proposed, including those based on divisibility, quantum mutual information, and trace distance. Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the behavior of OQSs. Here, we introduce a novel approach to quantifying non-Markovianity by focusing on metrological non-classical correlations. This approach is based on a discord-like measure of quantum correlations for multi-component quantum systems known as local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), which was introduced in [58]. It is defined as the minimization of quantum Fisher information with respect to local observables and measurements. Thereby, we examine some examples to clarify the use of our metric by applying it to three different channels: the phase damping channel, the amplitude damping channel, and the depolarizing channel. In contrast to other approaches, this new metric focuses on correlated bipartite $2\otimes d$ systems, has a clear physical interpretation, and effectively captures the features of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate that the non-Markovian or Markovian evolution of an open correlated bipartite system corresponds to an increase or decrease, respectively, in the quantumness of the quantum state. This quantumness is quantified by the maximum of the measurement-induced Fisher information across all local von Neumann measurements. Compared to measuring non-Markovianity based on local quantum uncertainty, a measure of non-classical correlation of the discord type based on single observables, our results confirm that the ..</description>

      <title>Singularity and regularity of the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate solution to the ill-posed 2D Stochastic Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the spatial properties of the SHF. We prove that, as a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This is obtained by probing a "quasi-critical" regime and showing the asymptotic log-normality of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength is sent to zero at a suitable rate, accompanied by similar results for critical 2D directed polymers. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is a.s. H\"older $C^{-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, implying the absence of atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>A Garden of Eden theorem for Smale spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Introduction to Hamiltonian Simulation via High-Order Product Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous and self-contained introduction to numerical methods for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing, with a focus on high-order product formulas for efficiently approximating the time evolution of quantum systems. Aimed at students and researchers seeking a clear mathematical treatment, the study begins with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computation before presenting the Lie-Trotter product formula and its higher-order generalizations. In particular, Suzuki's recursive method is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local Hamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks. The work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open challenges in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>
