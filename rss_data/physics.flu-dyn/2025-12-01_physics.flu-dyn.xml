      <title>Predicting liquid properties and behavior via droplet pinch-off and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate that the time-evolving interface observed during droplet formation, and consequently the resulting morphology nearing pinch-off, encode sufficient physical information for machine-learning (ML) frameworks to accurately infer key fluid properties, including viscosity and surface tension. Snapshots of dripping drops at the moment of break-up, together with their liquid properties and the flow rate, are used to form a data set for training ML algorithms. Experiments consisted of visualizing, using high-speed imaging, the process of droplet formation and identifying the frame closest to break-up. Experiments were conducted using Newtonian fluids under controlled flow conditions. In terms of the Reynolds (Re) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers, our conditions cover the domains 0.001&lt; Re&lt; 200 and 0.01 &lt; Oh &lt; 20, by using silicon oils, aqueous solutions of ethanol and glycerin, and methanol. For each case, flow parameters were recorded, along with images capturing the final stages of droplet break-up. Supervised regression models were trained to predict fluid parameters from the extracted contours of the breaking droplets. Our data set contains 840 examples. Our results demonstrate that the droplet geometry at pinch-off contains sufficient information to infer fluid properties by machine learning approaches. Our methods can predict surface tension, viscosity, or the droplet shape at pinch-off. These approaches provide alternatives to conventional methods to measure liquid properties while reducing measurement complexity and evaluation time and facilitating integration into automation. Unsupervised clustering is performed; the clusters represent regions in the Re-Oh and Bo-Oh planes, indicating that the latent representation may reveal physical properties and offering insight into droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mixed turbulence modeling using a super-resolution generative adversarial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic mixed super-resolution model (DMSRM) for large-eddy simulations (LESs) is proposed, which combines the traditional dynamic mixed model (DMM) formulation with the generation of super-resolved velocity fields from which the subfilter-scale (SFS) stress tensor can be computed. A data-driven super-resolution generative adversarial network (SR-GAN) is employed to upsample the grid-filtered velocity fields by a factor of two, enabling the evaluation of both scale-similarity and the dynamic Smagorinsky contributions. A priori analyses of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence show that the SR-GAN accurately reconstructs fine-scale flow features and generalizes well across different filter sizes and higher Reynolds number flow configurations, even for unseen input fields. The DMSRM reproduces SFS stresses and energy dissipation more accurately than the traditional DMM. A posteriori LES calculations further confirm that DMSRM predicts the energy spectrum and intermittency more accurately than DMM, even for different LES grid-scale resolutions and for higher Reynolds numbers than those used for training. Unlike DMM, DMSRM yields realistic backscatter and physically consistent SFS energy dissipation. These improvements arise from the physically accurate super-resolved fields generated by the SR-GAN, from which SFS stresses are directly computed. The result is a closure that accurately reproduces stress magnitudes and dissipation while reducing reliance on additional dissipation from the dynamic term. The DMSRM formulation achieves a balance of physical fidelity, robustness, and computational efficiency, offering a promising alternative to traditional DMMs for turbulence LES modeling.</description>

      <title>Droplet mobilization in actuated deformable tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mobilization of an oil droplet in a deformable, actuated constricted tube subjected to two different actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force in the fluid) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on the tube walls). Using high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations, we analyze the effects of actuation frequency and amplitude on droplet transport through the constriction. Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency. Our study highlights the potential of actuation mechanisms in deformable tubes for precise control of droplet transport in bio-microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Accurate Surrogate Modeling of Flapping Dynamics in Inverted Elastic Foils using Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cantilevered elastic foils can undergo self-induced, large-amplitude flapping when subject to fluid flow, a widely observed phenomenon of fluid-structure interaction, from fluttering leaves or the movement of fish fins. When harnessed in steady currents, these oscillations enable the extraction of kinetic energy from the flow. However, accurately predicting these dynamics requires high-fidelity simulations that are prohibitively expensive to perform across the broad configuration space needed for design optimization. To address this, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) surrogate for the inverted foil problem, modeled as an elastically mounted rigid foil undergoing trailing-edge pitching in uniform flow. The coupled fluid-structure dynamics are solved using a Petrov-Galerkin finite element method with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, providing high-fidelity data for training and validation. The surrogate uses a rotation-equivariant, quasi-monolithic GNN architecture: structural mesh motion is compressed via proper orthogonal decomposition and advanced through a multilayer perceptron. At the same time, the GNN evolves the flow field consistent with system states. Specifically, this study extends the hypergraph framework to flexible, self-oscillating foils, capturing the nonlinear coupling between vortex dynamics and structural motion. The GNN surrogate achieves less than 1.5% error in predicting tip displacement and force coefficients over thousands of time steps, while accurately reproducing dominant vortex-shedding frequencies. The model captures energy transfer metrics within 3% of full-order simulations, demonstrating both accuracy and long-term stability. These results show a new, efficient surrogate for long-horizon prediction of unsteady flow-structure dynamics in energy-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction performance of random reservoirs with different topology for nonlinear dynamical systems with different number of degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful framework for predicting nonlinear dynamical systems, yet the role of reservoir topology$-$particularly symmetry in connectivity and weights$-$remains not adequately understood. This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.</description>

      <title>Influence of Fluid Rheology on Fluid Flow in a Natural Fracture Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Newtonian rheology is widely acknowledged in subsurface fluids, yet its presence and effects are largely ignored in current fracture-flow studies. Here, we simulate fracture flow of non-Newtonian polymer solutions on a several metre-wide millimetre-aperture network of fractures, examining the complex interplay between fluid rheology, fracture geometry, and fluid inertia. Non-Newtonian fluid characteristics, including a yield stress and shear-thinning behaviour, are modelled using the Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou approach. For the investigated flow rates, our Navier-Stokes simulations reveal significant viscosity variations, resulting in complex flow patterns at both aperture- and network scale. At low rates, non-yielded fluid forms rigid zones occupying up to ~65% of the network cross-sectional area, reducing fracture flow connectivity. At high rates, shear-thinning promotes inertia-dominated flow with circulations near fracture intersections. Regarding flow partitioning, yield stress confines flow to dominant pathways while shear-thinning promotes a broader fluid distribution as compared with a Newtonian fluid. Observed multimodal velocity distributions and nonlinear pressure drop-flow rate relationships underscore that fluid rheology must be considered during fracture-flow modelling.</description>

      <title>U Net LSTM with incremental time-stepping for robust long-horizon unsteady flow prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) remains expensive when long horizons and multi-scale turbulence are involved. Data-driven surrogates promise relief, yet many degrade over multiple steps or drift from physical behavior. This work advances a hybrid path: an incremental time-stepping U Net LSTM model that forecasts unsteady dynamics by predicting field updates rather than absolute states. A U-Net encoder decoder extracts multi-scale spatial structures, LSTM layers carry temporal dependencies, and the network is trained on per-step increments of the physical fields, aligning learning with classical time marching and reducing compounding errors. The model is designed to slot into solvers based on projection methods (such as SIMPLE, PISO, etc), either as an initializer that delivers a sharper first guess for pressure-velocity coupling or as a corrective module that refines provisional fields. Across representative test cases, the approach improves long-term stability (54.53 to 84.21 % reduction of cumulative errors) and preserves engineering metrics, integral and averaged quantities, more reliably than standard learning baselines. These properties make it a plausible component of hybrid CFD-ML pipelines designed to accelerate unsteady simulations without compromising quantitative fidelity.</description>

      <title>Effect of cross-sectional anisotropy on shock train dynamics in supersonic internal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of duct aspect ratio ($AR$), defined as the ratio of major to minor axis in an elliptical duct, on shock train dynamics for a freestream Mach number of 2.1. The aspect ratio $AR$ is varied from 1.0 to 3.0 while maintaining a constant cross-sectional area and identical upstream conditions, thereby ensuring the same inlet mass flow and nearly constant boundary-layer-induced blockage across all $AR$. This isolates shape-induced confinement effects. Simulations are performed using an embedded-boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement which enabled a finest resolution of 48$\mu$m resolving the shocks in the shock train. The results show that increasing $AR$ significantly modifies the shock train morphology. The number of discrete shock cells decreases, and the leading shock front elongates along the major axis while contracting along the minor axis. The normal shock stem prominent in the circular duct (AR=1.0) nearly disappears at AR=3.0. Despite these morphological changes, the wall-pressure trace and stagnation-pressure loss remain largely insensitive to $AR$. These results indicate that while duct cross-section governs the detailed shock train structure, the overall efficiency of flow deceleration and pressure recovery is dictated primarily by the effective blockage imposed by the turbulent boundary layer, rather than the aspect ratio itself for a given mass flow rate and pressure ratio across the pseudo shock.</description>

      <title>Chiral Particles in Taylor-Couette Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates chiral particles, which break mirror symmetry, in turbulent Taylor--Couette flow. These particles generally display a translation-rotation coupling moving through a quiescent fluid. Here we performed experiments using large chiral particles (typical size \unit{5}{mm}) in turbulent Taylor--Couette flow, for Reynolds numbers $9\cdot10^3 \leq \text{Re} \leq 1.5 \cdot 10^5$. The density-matched chiral particles are studied in a dilute regime $(\phi = 1.7 \cdot 10^{-4})$, where their location and orientation are tracked over time to investigate the particle-fluid coupling. We investigate whether the translation-rotation coupling observed at low Reynolds numbers is still observable over the measured high Reynolds numbers, using the tracked location and orientation. Similarly, we verify whether the chiral particles display a preferred location or orientation, and whether the left-handed and right-handed particles show different rotation statistics. The location data show that the chiral particles closely follow the structure of Taylor vortices. Hence, the orientation data and rotation data of the chiral particles are split between the Taylor vortices and particle chiralities. The results show no difference in rotation and orientation dynamics between chiralities. Rather, the particle dynamics are flow-dominated, where the flow vorticity determines the specific particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bursting bubbles in Herschel-Bulkley fluids: dynamics and jetting transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a bubble rises to a free surface, its bursting dynamics in Newtonian fluids are governed by the interplay between viscous, capillary, and gravitational forces. In this work, we extend this classical problem to Herschel-Bulkley fluids, elucidating the role of viscoplasticity and non-Newtonian rheology in bubble bursting. Using direct numerical simulations validated against experiments, we systematically explore the influence of the key governing dimensionless parameters, such as the Bond number, the Ohnesorge number, the shear-dependent behavior and the plastocapillary number, each varied over several orders of magnitude. Our results reveal that viscoplasticity strongly controls the evolution and interaction of capillary waves within the cavity formed upon bubble rupture. Shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects are significant only for moderate Ohnesorge numbers, while at large Ohnesorge values the free surface dynamics converge to a non-flat equilibrium shape once the internal stresses fall below the yield stress. These findings provide new insights into the coupled effects of viscosity, gravity, yield stress, and shear-dependent rheology in multiphase flows, with broad implications for natural and industrial processes involving gas-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Bubble curtains in a lock-exchange flow: the importance of transient dynamics in the curtain-driven regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble curtains are line bubble plumes that are used to mitigate saltwater intrusion in shipping locks. When the lock gate that separates the saline seawater from the fresh river water is opened, a lock-exchange flow is initiated. Placing a bubble curtain at the gate location disrupts this flow and reduces saltwater infiltration. For practical applications, it is useful to quantify the effectiveness of the bubble curtain as a function of the governing parameters of the problem. To achieve this goal, we performed multiphase large eddy simulations that accurately reproduce previous experimental results including the two regimes of operation: the break-through and the curtain-driven regimes. This paper focusses on the curtain-driven regime and aims to unravel the temporal evolution of the effectiveness of bubble curtains. The detailed spatial and temporal information obtained from the simulations and the flexibility to vary the governing parameters allowed us to overcome several previous experimental limitations. In addition, the simulations were used to obtain parameters to build a semi-analytical model. Both the simulations and the semi-analytical model clearly describe and help to understand the time evolution of the density field and the effectiveness of the bubble curtain. These results show that the time elapsed since the opening of the gate and the transient dynamics are crucial for determining the effectiveness of bubble curtains.</description>

      <title>Simulations of inertial liquid-lens coalescence with the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta &lt; 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</description>

      <title>Active flow-driven DNA remodeling generates millimeter-scale mechanical oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In living systems, DNA undergoes continuous and rhythmic mechanical remodeling through condensation, looping, and disentangling to regulate gene expression, segregate chromosomes, and guide morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of satellite-derived SST data via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the super-resolution problem of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) using deep generative models. Although standard gap-filling techniques are effective in producing spatially complete datasets, they inherently smooth out fine-scale features that may be critical for a better understanding of the ocean dynamics. We investigate the use of deep learning models as Autoencoders (AEs) and generative models as Conditional-Generative Adversarial Networks (C-GANs), to reconstruct small-scale structures lost during interpolation. Our supervised -- model free -- training is based on SST observations of the Mediterranean Sea, with a focus on learning the conditional distribution of high-resolution fields given their low-resolution counterparts. We apply a tiling and merging strategy to deal with limited observational coverage and to ensure spatial continuity. Quantitative evaluations based on mean squared error metrics, spectral analysis, and gradient statistics show that while the AE reduces reconstruction error, it fails to recover high-frequency variability. In contrast, the C-GAN effectively restores the statistical properties of the true SST field at the cost of increasing the pointwise discrepancy with the ground truth observation. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to enhance the physical and statistical realism of gap-filled satellite data in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>Inferring Surface Slip in Active Colloids from Flow Fields Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed motion of active colloids is governed by spatial variations in surface chemistry and interfacial stress, yet these properties remain extremely difficult to measure directly. We introduce a physics-informed neural network framework that infers the slip distribution driving propulsion from partial observations of the surrounding flow. By combining sparse fluid velocity measurements with the Stokes equations and boundary constraints, the method reconstructs both the near-surface slip and the full velocity and pressure fields. Validation against analytical solutions and Boundary Element Method calculations for canonical active colloid models shows quantitative agreement in both unbounded and confined geometries. Crucially, the framework recovers the surface slip even when no flow data are available near the particle, demonstrating that accessible bulk measurements encode the interfacial stresses responsible for active motion. These results establish physics-informed inference as a powerful tool for characterizing and ultimately controlling interfacially driven transport in colloidal active matter.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\'ordoba-C\'ordoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural networks for phase-field method in three-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for modeling multiphase flows. However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are introduced to reduce long-term error accumulation and to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training, respectively. In numerical experiments on the two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems, the proposed method accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics that conventional PINNs fail to converge. It also extends to a three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity and density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing the phase-change dynamics and the formation of the pointy tip.</description>

      <title>Phytoscale Transport Physics: Insights into Xylem Flow Homeostasis and Drought Stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the flow dynamics of nutrient solution through the xylem vessels of Brassica juncea under drought stress. To this end, we perform experiments to obtain morphological traits of xylem vessels under drought-stressed conditions, and develop a mathematical framework to model the underlying flow through the xylem, considering several features relevant to the plant system. Performing experiments using state of the art instruments, we measure the morphology of xylem vessels, physicochemical and mechanical properties of xylem walls under drought stressed conditions. Our experimental results unveil that drought reduces both xylem diameter and pit aperture size, implicating hydraulic adaptations of plants to drought stress. We find that the reduced cellulose content in drought stressed xylem vessels lowers the zeta potential and decreases elasticity of the vascular region. Additionally, drought stress alters metabolite activity, increases reactive oxygen species, reduces chlorophyll content, and limits the uptake of essential metallic nutrients. Besides, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations to evaluate local flow field, mechanical stress, hydraulic conductivity, and radial transport efficiency of xylem vessels under drought stressed conditions. Simulated results reveal that under drought conditions, resistance to axial flow through xylem vessels increases significantly, which in turn, promotes radial transport of nutrients, allowing plants to survive even in drought stress. We show that the radial flow efficiency of xylem vessels becomes notably higher under drought stress than in well-watered control plants. Overall, results of this endeavor provide new insights into how geometric adaptations of xylem vessels modify flow behavior under water deficient conditions, enhancing the plants ability to survive environmental stress.</description>

      <title>Effect of near-inertial pumping on subduction at an ocean front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between near-inertial waves (NIWs) and submesoscale currents in the surface ocean are challenging to deconvolve due to their overlapping temporal and spatial scales. The frequency of NIW is modulated by the relative vorticity, $\zeta$, of submesoscale currents, which varies between positive and negative $\zeta$ of $O(f)$ on spatial scales of 1 -- 10~$km$, particularly across fronts where the horizontal buoyancy gradient, $\nabla_H b$, is intensified. The effective NIW frequency $f_{\small{eff}} = f + \zeta/2$ can therefore also vary by $O(f)$ on these scales, causing the waves to be out of phase. This generates periodic convergence and divergence in the surface layer, particularly at fronts. The resulting vertical motion, known as inertial pumping, is traditionally considered to be reversible. However, the strong vertical shear of the horizontal velocity at fronts, $v_z \sim |\nabla_H b|/f$, implies that not all of the water that is pumped downward will return. We examine the effect of this asymmetry on the vertical transport of tracers with an ambient vertical gradient, analogous to biogeochemical tracers, such as oxygen and dissolved organic carbon. Using numerical simulations of an unstable front forced by NIW, we demonstrate that inertial pumping can lead to net vertical transport of tracers. Spectral analysis of the vertical tracer flux -- given by the covariance between tracer anomaly and vertical velocity -- reveals that the interaction of strong NIW with submesoscale currents enhances the vertical exchange at the front on both the sub-inertial and inertial time scales.</description>

      <title>Analysis of surface tension in terms of force gradient per unit area -- Part I : a thought experiment using the principle of equivalence in fluid mechanics</title>

Abstract: Conventionally, surface tension is expressed as a force per unit length or as an energy per unit area. In this paper, we propose a thought experiment that consists of replacing the surface tension with an equivalent force per unit area according to the principles of fluid mechanics. Such a system of equivalent forces makes it possible to analyze the surface tension phenomenon in terms of surface stress gradient or in terms of energy per unit volume and allows us to rewrite the known equations by calculating the equilibrium of forces in the stationary state. These new equations will be applied to known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube, Wilhelmy blade and equilibrium of drops and semi-drops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the combined effects of natural convection and rotation on the dissolution of a solute in a solvent-filled circular cylinder. The density of the fluid increases with the increasing concentration of the dissolved solute, and we model this using the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. The underlying moving-boundary problem has been modelled by combining the Navier-Stokes equations with the advection-diffusion equation and a Stefan condition for the evolving solute-fluid interface. We use highly resolved numerical simulations to investigate the flow regimes, dissolution rates, and mixing of the dissolved solute for $Sc = 1$, $Ra \in [10^5, 10^8]$ and $\Omega \in [0, 2.5]$. In the absence of rotation and buoyancy, the distance of the interface from its initial position follows a square root relationship with time ($r_d \propto \sqrt{t}$), which ceases to exist at a later time due to the finite-size effect of the liquid domain. We then explore the rotation parameter, considering a range of rotation frequency -- from smaller to larger, relative to the inverse of the buoyancy-induced timescale -- and Rayleigh number. We show that the area of the dissolved solute varies nonlinearly with time depending on $Ra$ and $\Omega$. The symmetry breaking of the interface is best described in terms of $Ra/\Omega^2$.</description>

      <title>Thermo-viscous instability of flow in a weakly heat-conducting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An instability may arise when a hot viscous fluid enters a thin gap and cools through heat transfer to a colder surrounding environment. Fluids whose viscosity increases strongly upon cooling create a positive feedback in which warmer regions flow faster and cool more slowly, leading to the formation of thermo-viscous "fingers". Here we investigate this mechanism in the long-time, small-Biot number regime, where cooling through the plates is weak but acts over sufficiently long times that the temperature becomes nearly uniform across the gap heat. This asymptotic limit enables a depth-averaged description that incorporates both thermal diffusion and hydrodynamic (Taylor) dispersion, allowing us to analyze the dependence of the instability on the P\'eclet number, viscosity contrast, and wall-cooling rate. Using numerical simulations of temperature-dependent viscous flow in a Hele-Shaw geometry, we show that finger-like instabilities emerge in response to small inlet perturbations within a range of P\'eclet numbers and viscosity contrasts. A linear stability analysis yields the dispersion relation and quantifies how the fastest growth rate $\gamma_{\max}$ and corresponding wavenumber $k_{\max}$ depend on the global parameters. We further derive analytical expressions for $\gamma_{\max}$ and $k_{\max}$ in the limit of high P\'eclet number and large viscosity contrast, revealing the scaling behavior that controls pattern selection. These results clarify the physical mechanisms driving thermo-viscous fingering in the small-Biot number regime and have implications for systems in which temperature-dependent viscous fluids are confined within narrow gaps, such as lubrication flows in mechanical components and magma invasion in millimeter-scale fissures.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study on Jet-Like Outwash Induced by Multi-Rotor eVTOLs and Engineering Approaches for Outwash Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of outwash phenomena generated by electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with particular emphasis on how rotor geometry and alignment shape hazardous airflow patterns at vertiports. Using nondimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with the k-omega SST turbulence model implemented in OpenFOAM, the research systematically characterizes jet-like outwash across a range of multi-rotor configurations. Results demonstrate that propeller count and inter-propeller spacing are primary determinants of outwash intensity, orientation, propagation range, and boundary-layer structure. For power-lift eVTOLs, low propeller counts combined with narrow spacing produce highly directional, intensified jet-like outwash with propagation ranges far exceeding current FAA EB105a safety standards. Conversely, higher propeller counts and larger spacings reduce peak velocities and propagation distances, enabling safer and more compact vertiport layouts. High-propeller-count designs further exhibit vertically stratified and thickened outwash boundary layers, requiring tailored mitigation strategies. Targeted engineering solutions-such as modular blast deflectors aligned with predicted outwash directions-are shown to reduce required vertiport safety areas by up to 82% without compromising operational safety. These findings establish a direct link between aircraft design, regulatory compliance, and infrastructure optimization, offering practical pathways for safe and scalable urban air mobility. The study also provides a foundation for future research on optimal mitigation device geometries and system-level integration of eVTOL operations within urban environments.</description>

      <title>Experiments on rapidly rotating convection: the role of the Prandtl number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flows at planetary scales are generally driven by buoyancy and influenced by rotation. Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRBC) is a practical and simple model that can be used to describe these systems. In RRBC, thermally induced convection occurs, which is influenced by the constant rotation it experiences. We study RRBC in a cylinder in the \red{transition region between rotation-affected and rotation-dominated (also called geostrophic) convection}. Experiments are performed to assess the dependence of the Nusselt number $\Nu$ (efficiency of convective heat transfer) on the Prandtl number $\Pr$ (ratio of kinematic viscosity over thermal diffusivity), a relation that is not explored much for geostrophic convection. By using water at different mean temperatures we can reach $2.8\le \Pr\le 6$. We study the relation between $\Pr$ and $\Nu$ at constant Ekman number $\Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ (an inverse measure for strength of rotation) for two different diameter-to-height aspect ratios ($\Gamma=1/5$ and $1/2$) of the setup. The corresponding constant Rayleigh numbers (strength of thermal forcing) are $\Ra=1.1\times 10^{12}$ and $1\times 10^{11}$, respectively. Additionally, we measure the relation between the Rayleigh number $\Ra$ and $\Nu$ for $4\times10^{10}\le \Ra\le 7\times10^{11}$, $\Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ and $\Pr=3.7$. It is found that $\Nu$ exhibits a significant dependence on $\Pr$, even within this limited range. Increasing $\Pr$ by a factor 2 resulted in a decrease of $\Nu$ of about $25 \%$. We hypothesize that the decrease of $\Nu$ is caused by the changing ratio of the thermal and kinetic boundary layer thicknesses as a result of increasing $\Pr$. We also consider the anticipated contributions of the wall mode to the heat transfer using sidewall temperature measurements.</description>

      <title>The impact of pressure oscillations on bubble rising in shear-thinning fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rising dynamics of a bubble driven into periodic volumetric oscillations by an external pressure driving within a highly viscous shear-thinning fluid. We perform axisymmetric direct numerical simulations employing the Carreau-Yasuda model to describe the rheological behavior of the fluid and the finite element method to discretize the equations. We carry out a parametric study of the bubble rising dynamics, changing the amplitude and the frequency of the external pressure driving, and the bubble radius. Due to the external pressure oscillations, the bubble undergoes volume changes that strain the liquid at much larger rates than those due to natural rising, causing the surrounding fluid viscosity to thin. The numerical results show that the rising dynamics become highly nonlinear and unsteady due to the interplay of the shear-thinning rheology and the external driving. As a result, the period-averaged rising velocity of the bubble can increase by orders of magnitude compared to its natural rising velocity. These nonlinear effects become progressively more important as the amplitude and the frequency of the pressure driving or the bubble radius are increased. Qualitatively, the simulation model agrees with previous experimental findings in terms of average rising velocity. However, the experiments exhibit terminal velocities that are smaller than those predicted numerically, along with differences in bubble shape during the ascent. These discrepancies may be attributed to modeling the fluid rheology as a generalized Newtonian fluid rather than as a viscoelastic one.</description>

Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This phenomenon is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation and post-processing, a priori learning, and a posteriori testing, where data-driven models enrich differential equations.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of thermo-diffusively unstable premixed hydrogen-air flames in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=530$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of premixed hydrogen-air flames anchored in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) are performed at a friction Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=530$ and thermochemical conditions susceptible to the emergence of intrinsic thermo-diffusive (TD) phenomena acting on the turbulent flame. Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it.
  The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena.
  At $\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed.</description>

      <title>An octree-based sampling algorithm for analyzing big simulation data</title>

Abstract: As computational resources continue to increase, the storage and analysis of vast amounts of data will inevitably become a bottleneck in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and related fields. Although compression algorithms and efficient data formats can mitigate this issue, they are often insufficient when post-processing large amounts of volume data. Processing such data may require additional high-performance software and resources, or it may restrict the analysis to shorter time series or smaller regions of interest. The present work proposes an improved version of the existing \emph{Sparse Spatial Sampling} algorithm ($S^3$) to reduce the data from time-dependent flow simulations. The $S^3$ algorithm iteratively generates a time-invariant octree grid based on a user-defined metric, efficiently down-sampling the data while aiming to preserve as much of the metric as possible. Using the sampled grid allows for more efficient post-processing and enables memory-intensive tasks, such as computing the modal decomposition of flow snapshots. The enhanced version of $S^3$ is tested and evaluated on the scale-resolving simulations of the flow past a tandem configuration of airfoils in the transonic regime, the incompressible turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, and the flow around an aircraft half-model at high Reynolds and Mach numbers. $S^3$ significantly reduces the number of mesh cells by $35 \%$ to $98\%$ for all test cases while accurately preserving the dominant flow dynamics, enabling post-processing of CFD data on a local workstation rather than HPC resources for many cases.</description>

      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, the core task of flow networks is to transport solutes and perfuse all cells or media equally with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and self-organize their geometry for homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that also artificial flow networks can self-organize toward homogeneous perfusion by the versatile adaption of controlled erosion. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of the eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to the homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification for bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates model reduction techniques for nonlinear parameterized and time-dependent PDEs, specifically focusing on bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We develop interpretable and non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) capable of capturing dynamics associated with bifurcations by identifying a minimal set of coordinates. Our methodology combines the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method with a deep learning framework based on Autoencoder (AE) architectures. To enhance dimensionality reduction, we integrate a nested Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with the SINDy-AE architecture, enabling a sparse discovery of system dynamics while maintaining efficiency of the reduced model. We demonstrate our approach via two challenging test cases defined on sudden-expansion channel geometries: a symmetry-breaking bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. Starting from a comprehensive analysis of their high-fidelity behavior, i.e. symmetry-breaking phenomena and the rise of unsteady periodic solutions, we validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our ROMs. The results show successful reconstruction of the bifurcations, accurate prediction of system evolution for unseen parameter values, and significant speed-up compared to full-order methods.</description>

      <title>Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</description>
