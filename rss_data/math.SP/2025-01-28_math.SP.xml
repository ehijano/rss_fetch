      <title>Two disks maximize the third Robin eigenvalue: positive parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian on a simply-connected planar domain of given area is bounded above by the corresponding eigenvalue of a disjoint union of two equal disks, for Robin parameters in $[-4\pi,4\pi]$. This sharp inequality was known previously only for negative parameters in $[-4\pi,0]$, by Girouard and Laugesen. Their proof fails for positive Robin parameters because the second eigenfunction on a disk has non-monotonic radial part. This difficulty is overcome for parameters in $(0,4\pi]$ by means of a degree-theoretic approach suggested by Karpukhin and Stern that yields suitably orthogonal trial functions.</description>

      <title>Steklov isospectrality of conformal metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov spectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to a natural gauge invariance, from its Steklov spectrum; we are interested in the case of conformal metrics. In this context, linearizing the problem means considering isospectral deformations of $g$, as V.W. Guillemin and D. Kazhdan did for the Laplacian in a pioneering paper in the early 1980s. We then prove that such deformations preserve the jet of the initial metric $g$ at the boundary if the induced metric $h$ is Anosov and the lengths of its closed geodesics are simple, the latter being a generic condition. More generally for the non-linear problem in dimension $n\geq 3$, we show, when the metric $h$ is Anosov, that generically the Steklov spectrum determines the jet of $g$ at any point $p$ of the boundary within the class of conformal metrics that coincide at the boundary. It is possible to remove this boundary equality condition in dimension $3$ when $h$ has constant negative curvature, and in any dimension under the assumption that the conformal factor increases the length of closed $h$-geodesics marked by free homotopy classes. The paper mainly combines the use of wave trace invariants with the injectivity of the X-ray transform for functions on a closed Anosov manifold. Using similar techniques, we also show under the same dynamical assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow that generically a smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the Steklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by the spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\"odinger operator with potential $q$.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctions with double exponential rate of localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a real-valued solution to the eigenvalue problem $-\text{div}(A\nabla u)=\lambda u$, $\lambda&gt;0,$ in the cylinder $\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ with a real, uniformly elliptic, and uniformly $C^1$ matrix $A$ such that $|u(x,y,t)|\leq C e^{-c e^{c|t|}}$ for some $c,C&gt;0$. We also construct a complex-valued solution to the heat equation $u_t=\Delta u + B \nabla u$ in a half-cylinder with continuous and uniformly bounded $B$, which also decays with double exponential speed. Related classical ideas, used in the construction of counterexamples to the unique continuation by Plis and Miller, are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Bulk-edge correspondence in finite photonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite two-dimensional photonic structures. Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques, which relax the smoothness requirements on the underlying structures and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advancements in discrete models.</description>

      <title>Sloshing, Steklov and corners: Asymptotics of sloshing eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.01891v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we develop an approach to obtain sharp spectral asymptotics for Steklov type problems on planar domains with corners. Our main focus is on the two-dimensional sloshing problem, which is a mixed Steklov-Neumann boundary value problem describing small vertical oscillations of an ideal fluid in a container or in a canal with a uniform cross-section. We prove a two-term asymptotic formula for sloshing eigenvalues. In particular, this confirms a conjecture posed by Fox and Kuttler in 1983. We also obtain similar eigenvalue asymptotics for other related mixed Steklov type problems, and discuss applications to the study of Steklov spectral asymptotics on polygons.</description>

      <title>On localisation of eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove (i) a simple sufficient geometric condition for localisation of a sequence of first Dirichlet eigenfunctions provided the corresponding Dirichlet Laplacians satisfy a uniform Hardy inequality, and (ii) localisation of a sequence of first Dirichlet eigenfunctions for a wide class of elongating horn-shaped domains. We give examples of sequences of simply connected, planar, polygonal domains for which the corresponding sequence of first eigenfunctions with either Dirichlet, or Neumann, boundary conditions $\kappa$-localise in $L^2$.</description>

      <title>A note on the magnetic Steklov operator on functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Steklov eigenvalue problem on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary for generic magnetic potentials and establish various results concerning the spectrum. We provide equivalent characterizations of magnetic Steklov operators which are unitarily equivalent to the classical Steklov operator and study bounds for the smallest eigenvalue. We prove a Cheeger-Jammes type lower bound for the first eigenvalue by introducing magnetic Cheeger constants. We also obtain an analogue of an upper bound for the first magnetic Neumann eigenvalue due to Colbois, El Soufi, Ilias and Savo. In addition, we compute the full spectrum in the case of the Euclidean $2$-ball and $4$-ball for a particular choice of magnetic potential given by Killing vector fields, and discuss the behavior. Finally, we establish a comparison result for the magnetic Steklov operator associated with the manifold and the square root of the magnetic Laplacian on the boundary, which generalizes the uniform geometric upper bounds for the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues in the non-magnetic case due to Colbois, Girouard and Hassannezhad.</description>
