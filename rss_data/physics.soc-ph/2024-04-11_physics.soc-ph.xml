      <title>ACRONYM: Augmented degree corrected, Community Reticulated Organized Network Yielding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling networks can serve as a means of summarizing high-dimensional complex systems. Adapting an approach devised for dense, weighted networks, we propose a new method for generating and estimating unweighted networks. This approach can describe a broader class of potential networks than existing models, including those where nodes in different subnetworks connect to one another via various attachment mechanisms, inducing flexible and varied community structures. While unweighted edges provide less resolution than continuous weights, restricting to the binary case permits the use of likelihood-based estimation techniques, which can improve estimation of nodal features. The extra flexibility may contribute a different understanding of network generating structures, particularly for networks with heterogeneous densities in different regions.</description>

      <title>Promoting collective cooperation through temporal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cooperation drives the dynamics of many natural, social, and economic phenomena, making understanding the evolution of cooperation with evolutionary game theory a central question of modern science. Although human interactions are best described as complex networks, current explorations are limited to static networks where interactions represented by network links are permanent and do not change over time. In reality, human activities often involve temporal interactions, where links are impermanent, and understanding the evolution of cooperation on such ubiquitous temporal networks is an open question. Here, we present a general framework for systematically analyzing how collective cooperation evolves on any temporal network, which unifies the study of evolutionary game dynamics with dynamic and static interactions. We show that the emergence of cooperation is facilitated by a simple rule of thumb: hubs (individuals with many social ties) should be temporally deprioritized in interactions. We further provide a quantitative metric capturing the priority of hubs, which we utilize to orchestrate the ordering of interactions to best promote cooperation on empirical temporal networks. Our findings unveil the fundamental advantages conferred by temporal interactions for promoting collective cooperation, which transcends the specific insights gleaned from studying traditional static snapshots.</description>

      <title>Humboldt Highway II -- computer cluster on renewable energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In August 2023, IT experts and scientists came together for a workshop to discuss the possibilities of building a computer cluster fully on renewable energies, as a test-case at Havana University in Cuba. The discussion covered the scientific needs for a computer cluster for particle physics at the InSTEC institute at Havana University, the possibilities to use solar energy, new developments in computing technologies, and computer cluster operation as well as operational needs for computing in particle physics. This computer cluster on renewable energies at the InSTEC institute is seen as a prototype for a large-scale computer cluster on renewable energies for scientific computing in the Caribbean, hosted in Cuba. The project is called "Humboldt Highway", to remember Alexander von Humboldt's achievements in bringing cultures of the American and European continents closer together by exchange and travel. In this spirit, we propose a project that enables and intensifies the scientific exchange between research laboratories and universities in Europe and the Caribbean, in particular Cuba.</description>

      <title>Social Dilemma of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fighting infectious diseases posing a global health threat, ranging from influenza to Zika, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social distancing and face covering, remain mitigation measures public health can resort to. However, the success of NPI lies in sufficiently high levels of collective compliance, otherwise giving rise to waves of infection incidences that are not only driven by pathogen evolution but also changing vigilance in the population. Here we show that compliance with each NPI measure can be highly dynamic and context-dependent during an ongoing epidemic, where individuals may prefer one to another or even do nothing, leading to intricate temporal switching behavior of NPI adoptions. By characterizing dynamic regimes through the perceived costs of NPI measures and their effectiveness in particular regarding face covering and social distancing, our work offers new insights into overcoming barriers in NPI adoptions.</description>

      <title>Improving Network Degree Correlation by Degree-preserving Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degree correlation is a crucial measure in networks, significantly impacting network topology and dynamical behavior. The degree sequence of a network is a significant characteristic, and altering network degree correlation through degree-preserving rewiring poses an interesting problem. In this paper, we define the problem of maximizing network degree correlation through a finite number of rewirings and use the assortativity coefficient to measure it. We analyze the changes in assortativity coefficient under degree-preserving rewiring and establish its relationship with the s-metric. Under our assumptions, we prove the problem to be monotonic and submodular, leading to the proposal of the GA method to enhance network degree correlation. By formulating an integer programming model, we demonstrate that the GA method can effectively approximate the optimal solution and validate its superiority over other baseline methods through experiments on three types of real-world networks. Additionally, we introduce three heuristic rewiring strategies, EDA, TA and PEA, and demonstrate their applicability to different types of networks. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to explore the impact of these rewiring strategies on several spectral robustness metrics based on the adjacency matrix. Finally, we examine the robustness of various centrality metrics in the network while enhancing network degree correlation using the GA method.</description>

      <title>An equilibrium-seeking search algorithm for integrating large-scale activity-based and dynamic traffic assignment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an iterative methodology to integrate large-scale behavioral activity-based models with dynamic traffic assignment models. The main novelty of the proposed approach is the decoupling of the two parts, allowing the ex-post integration of any existing model as long as certain assumptions are satisfied. A measure of error is defined to characterize a search space easily explorable within its boundaries. Within it, a joint distribution of the number of trips and travel times is identified as the equilibrium distribution, i.e., the distribution for which trip numbers and travel times are bound in the neighborhood of the equilibrium between supply and demand. The approach is tested on a medium-sized city of 400,000 inhabitants and the results suggest that the proposed iterative approach does perform well, reaching equilibrium between demand and supply in a limited number of iterations thanks to its perturbation techniques. Overall, 15 iterations are needed to reach values of the measure of error lower than 10%. The equilibrium identified this way is then validated against baseline distributions to demonstrate the goodness of the results.</description>

      <title>Streaming detection of significant delay changes in public transport systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public transport systems are expected to reduce pollution and contribute to sustainable development. However, disruptions in public transport such as delays may negatively affect mobility choices. To quantify delays, aggregated data from vehicle locations systems are frequently used. However, delays observed at individual stops are caused inter alia by fluctuations in running times and propagation of delays occurring in other locations. Hence, in this work, we propose both the method detecting significant delays and reference architecture, relying on stream processing engines, in which the method is implemented. The method can complement the calculation of delays defined as deviation from schedules. This provides both online rather than batch identification of significant and repetitive delays, and resilience to the limited quality of location data. The method we propose can be used with different change detectors, such as ADWIN, applied to location data stream shuffled to individual edges of a transport graph. It can detect in an online manner at which edges statistically significant delays are observed and at which edges delays arise and are reduced. Detections can be used to model mobility choices and quantify the impact of repetitive rather than random disruptions on feasible trips with multimodal trip modelling engines. The evaluation performed with the public transport data of over 2000 vehicles confirms the merits of the method and reveals that a limited-size subgraph of a transport system graph causes statistically significant delays</description>

      <title>Compositional Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review models of compositional growth, which were introduced to explain the growth statistics of various quantities ranging from firm sizes to GDP. In these models, entities are decomposed into units that grow independently. Thus, the growth rate of the entity is the addition of the growth rates of the composing units, with possibly heterogeneous weights. We review such models and show that they can be understood through a unifying theoretical framework, explaining the resulting growth rate distributions using mixtures of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>Testing structural balance theories in heterogeneous signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of data about social relationships allows the human behavior to be analyzed as any other natural phenomenon. Here we focus on balance theory, stating that social actors tend to avoid establishing cycles with an odd number of negative links. This statement, however, can be supported only after a comparison with a benchmark. Since the existing ones disregard actors' heterogeneity, we extend Exponential Random Graphs to signed networks with both global and local constraints and employ them to assess the significance of empirical unbalanced patterns. We find that the nature of balance crucially depends on the null model: while homogeneous benchmarks favor the weak balance theory, according to which only triangles with one negative link should be under-represented, heterogeneous benchmarks favor the strong balance theory, according to which also triangles with all negative links should be under-represented. Biological networks, instead, display strong frustration under any benchmark, confirming that structural balance inherently characterizes social networks.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>
