      <title>An affirmative answer to an open problem on Ramanujan's asymptotic formula of zero-balanced hypergeometric function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using recurrence method and new properties of beta function and Ramanujan $R$-function, we prove the absolute monotonicity result for a function related to Ramanujan asymptotic formula of zero-balanced hypergeometric function, which gives an affirmative answer to an open problem proposed by Anderson Vamanamurthy and Vuorinen \cite{Anderson-CIIQM-JW-1997} in 1997.</description>

      <title>A simple oscillation criteria for second-order differential equations with piecewise constant argument of generalized type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents two simple criteria for determining the oscillatory nature of solutions to second-order differential equations with deviated arguments. These criteria extend the Leighton-type criteria established by G.Q. Wang and S.S. Cheng, considering a more general piecewise constant argument. Finally, we provide some examples.</description>

      <title>Error bound for the asymptotic expansion of the Hartman-Watson integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note gives a bound on the error of the leading term of the $t\to 0$ asymptotic expansion of the Hartman-Watson distribution $\theta(r,t)$ in the regime $rt=\rho$ constant. The leading order term has the form $\theta(\rho/t,t)=\frac{1}{2\pi t}e^{-\frac{1}{t} (F(\rho)-\pi^2/2)} G(\rho) (1 + \vartheta(t,\rho))$, where the error term is bounded uniformly over $\rho$ as $|\vartheta(t,\rho)|\leq \frac{1}{70}t$.</description>

      <title>Forced oscillations for generalized $\Phi$-Laplacian equations with Carath\'eodory perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using topological methods, we study the structure of the set of forced oscillations of a class of parametric, implicit ordinary differential equations with a generalized $\Phi$-Laplacian type term. We work in the Carath\'eodory setting. Under suitable assumptions, involving merely the Brouwer degree in Euclidean spaces, we obtain global bifurcation results. In some illustrative examples we provide a visual representation of the bifurcating set.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Regular linear time varying DAEs are equivalent to DAEs in strong standard canonical form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between solvability of linear diffential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and their transformability into canonical forms has been investigated for more than forty years.
  After a comparative analysis of numerous DAE frameworks the notions regularity and almost regularity were established only recently. Regular DAEs resulted to be equivalently transformable into so-called standard canonical forms (SCF) with block-structured nilpotent matrix functions featuring certain rank properties.
  In this paper we prove that for regular DAEs, even a transformation into a strong standard canonical form (SSCF) is possible, i.e. a SCF with a constant nilpotent matrix. We start from block-structured SCF and give a constructive proof.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: Applications to plasma confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the zero order approximation of a charged particle under the influence of a strong magnetic field in a mathematically rigorous manner and clarify in which sense this approximation is valid. We use this to further rigorously derive a displacement formula for the pressure of plasma equilibria and compare our findings to results in the physics literature. The main novelty of our results is a qualitative estimate of the confinement time for optimised plasma equilibria with respect to the gyro frequency. These results are of interest in the context of plasma fusion confinement.</description>

      <title>Kernel and image of the Biot-Savart operator and their applications in stellarator designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Biot-Savart operator acting on $W^{-\frac{1}{2},2}$ regular, div-free, surface currents $j$ \begin{gather}
  \nonumber
  \operatorname{BS}(j)(x)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}j(y)\times \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}d\sigma(y)\text{, }x\in \Omega \end{gather} where $\Sigma$ is a connected surface to which $j$ is tangent and where $\Omega$ is the finite domain bounded by $\Sigma$.
  We answer two questions regarding this operator.
  i) We provide an algorithm which converges (theoretically) exponentially fast to an element of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator, as well as characterise the elements of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator in terms of certain solutions to exterior boundary value problems. This allows one to explicitly exploit the non-uniqueness of the coil reconstruction process in the context of stellarator designs.
  ii) We provide a simple, concise characterisation of the image of the Biot-Savart operator. This allows to define a 2-step current reconstruction procedure to obtain surface currents which approximate to arbitrary precision a prescribed target magnetic field within the plasma region of a stellarator device. The first step does not require computing integrals involving singular integral kernels of the form $\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}$ but may have a potentially slow convergence rate, while the second step requires the computation of integrals involving singular integral kernels but in turn has (theoretically) an exponential convergence rate. This approximation procedure always leads to approximating surface currents which are as poloidal as possible.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power-Weighted Birman--Hardy--Rellich-type Inequalities on Finite Intervals and Annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an optimal power-weighted Hardy-type inequality in integral form on finite intervals and subsequently prove the analogous inequality in differential form. We note that the optimal constant of the latter inequality differs from the former. Moreover, by iterating these inequalities we derive the sequence of power-weighted Birman-Hardy-Rellich-type inequalities in integral form on finite intervals and then also prove the analogous sequence of inequalities in differential form.
  We use the one-dimensional Hardy-type result in differential form to derive an optimal multi-dimensional version of the power-weighted Hardy inequality in differential form on annuli (i.e., spherical shell domains), and once more employ an iteration procedure to derive the Birman-Hardy-Rellich-type sequence of power-weighted higher-order Hardy-type inequalities for annuli.
  In the limit as the annulus approaches $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\{0\}$, we recover well-known prior results on Rellich-type inequalities on $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>A Singular Integral for a Simplified Clairaut Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This expository article on the Lagrange singular integral contains two novelties. The first novelty involves a connection between the Lagrange singular integral for a simplified Clairaut equation, and Euler's homogeneous function theorem. The paper presents a formal derivation of Euler's solution from Lagrange's complete integral, though with some caveats, and also constructs more general surfaces from the complete integral which go beyond Euler's solutions. The first rather complicated construction is based directly on Goursat's definition of a general integral, while the subsequent simpler constructions are based on a suitably expanded notion of the general integral. This generalized general integral is our second novelty. It bridges some of the gap between the the general integral, and the complete integral, partially addressing Evans' remarks (Partial Differential Equations, AMS Graduate Studies in Mathematics, 1998) on the limitations of the general integral. Finally we discuss some subtleties around complete integrals as noted by Chojnacki (Proceedings of the AMS, 1995) and some around general integrals as noted by Evans, and how they apply to our examples. We aim to present these classical PDE concepts to readers with a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus.</description>

      <title>Sophomore's dream function: asymptotics, complex plane behavior and relation to the error function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sophomore's dream sum $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}$ is extended to the function $f(t,a)=t\int_{0}^{1}(ax)^{-tx}dx$ with $f(1,1)=S$. Asymptotic behavior for a large $|t|$ is obtained, which is exponential for $t&gt;0$ and $t&lt;0,a&gt;1$, and inverse-logarithmic for $t&lt;0,a&lt;1$. An advanced approximation includes a half-derivative of the exponent and is expressed in terms of the error function. This approach provides excellent interpolation description in the complex plane. The function $f(t,a)$ demonstrates for $a&gt;1$ oscillating behavior along the imaginary axis with slowly increasing amplitude and the period of $2\pi iea$, modulation by high-frequency oscillations being present. Also, $f(t,a)$ has non-trivial zeros in the left complex half-plane with Im$t_n \simeq 2(n-1/8)\pi e/a$ for $a&gt;1$. The results obtained describe analytical integration of the function $x^{tx}$.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Remarks on some Limit Geometric Properties related to an Idempotent and Non-Associative Algebraic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes the geometric properties of an idempotent, non-associative algebraic structure that extends the Max-Times semiring. This algebraic structure is useful for studying systems of Max-Times and Max-Plus equations, employing an appropriate notion of a non-associative determinant. We consider a connected ultrametric distance and demonstrate that it implies, among other properties, an analogue of the Pythagorean relation. To this end, we introduce a suitable notion of a right angle between two vectors and investigate a trigonometric concept associated with the Chebyshev unit ball. Following this approach, we explore the potential implications of these properties in the complex plane.
  We provide an algebraic definition of a line passing through two points, which corresponds to the Painlev\'e-Peano-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of generalized lines. We establish that this definition leads to distinctive geometric properties; in particular, two distinct parallel lines may share an infinite number of points.</description>

      <title>On the weak Sard property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $f\colon [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^2$ then Sard's theorem implies that $f$ has the following relaxed Sard property: the image under $f$ of the Lebesgue measure restricted to the critical set of $f$ is a singular measure. We show that for $C^{1,\alpha}$ functions with $\alpha&lt;1$ this property is strictly stronger than the weak Sard property introduced by Alberti, Bianchini and Crippa, while for any monotone continuous function these two properties are equivalent.
  We also show that even in the one-dimensional setting H\"older regularity is not sufficient for the relaxed Sard property.</description>
