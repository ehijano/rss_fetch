      <title>A state-space catch-at-length assessment model for redfish on the Eastern Grand Bank of Newfoundland reveals large uncertainties in data and stock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a state-space age-structured catch-at-length (ACL) assessment model for redfish in NAFO Divisions 3LN. The model was developed to address limitations in the surplus production model that was previously used to assess this stock. The ACL model included temporal variations in recruitment, growth, and mortality rates, which were limitations identified for the surplus production model. Our ACL model revealed some important discrepancies in survey and fishery length compositions. Our model also required large population dynamics process errors to achieve good fits to survey indices and catch estimates, which also demonstrated that additional understanding of these data and other model assumptions is required. As such, we do not propose the ACL model to provide management advice for 3LN redfish, but we do provide research recommendations that should provide a better basis to model the 3LN redfish stock dynamics. Recommendations include implementing sampling programs to determine redfish species/ecotypes in commercial and research survey catches and improving biological sampling for maturity and age.</description>

      <title>Analysis of genetic diversity among some Iraqi durum wheat cultivars revealed by different molecular markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Durum wheat has been cultivated since the beginning of crop domestication, occupying now the tenth ranking among the global most significant cultivated crops. Despite the fact that, the extent of the crop genetic diversity has not yet fully incorporated into modern varieties through breeding programs. In this study, a total of 35 markers (11 RAPD, 12 ISSR, and 12 CDDP) were utilized to assess the genetic variability and population structure of sixteen different cultivars of Iraqi durum wheat. Out of 294 bands obtained, 171 were identified as polymorphic: 47.00 polymorphic alleles from 98 RAPD bands, 53 polymorphic alleles from a total of 89 ISSR bands, and 71 alleles from 107 CDDP bands. The average number of observed alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), Shannon's information index (I), expected heterozygosity or gene diversity (He), unbiased expected heterozygosity (uHe), and polymorphic information content (PIC) (1.45, 1.38, 0.32, 0.22, 0.24, and 0.28, respectively) were obtained for RAPDs , (1.63, 1.45, 0.40, 0.27, 0.29, and 0.32, respectively) ISSRs and (1.35, 1.35, 0.31, 0.21, 0.23, and 0.30, respectively) for the CDDP markers. A dendrogram of two main clades (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean; UPGMA) and three populations of structure analysis, were obtained based on the three markers data. The analysis of molecular variance indicated 97.00%, 97.00%, and 90.00% variability within populations, applying RAPD, ISSR, and CDDP markers, respectively. The highest diversity indices were revealed in population 2 under the RAPD and CDDP markers, whereas population 1 had the highest values of these indices according to the ISSR markers. The results provide greater knowledge on the genetic makeup of Iraqi durum wheat cultivars, that facilitate future breeding programs of this crop.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Transmission Modeling with Fractional Derivatives and Environmental Pathogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research presents an advanced fractional-order compartmental model designed to delve into the complexities of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, specifically accounting for the influence of environmental pathogens on disease spread. By enhancing the classical compartmental framework, our model distinctively incorporates the effects of order derivatives and environmental shedding mechanisms on the basic reproduction numbers, thus offering a holistic perspective on transmission dynamics. Leveraging fractional calculus, the model adeptly captures the memory effect associated with disease spread, providing an authentic depiction of the virus's real-world propagation patterns. A thorough mathematical analysis confirming the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the model's solutions emphasizes its robustness. Furthermore, the numerical simulations, meticulously calibrated with real COVID-19 case data, affirm the model's capacity to emulate observed transmission trends, demonstrating the pivotal role of environmental transmission vectors in shaping public health strategies. The study highlights the critical role of environmental sanitation and targeted interventions in controlling the pandemic's spread, suggesting new insights for research and policy-making in infectious disease management.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree II: Overview and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively (from the root) split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of the model is an active research topic, and this article provides an extensive overview what is currently known. For many results there are different proofs, probabilistic or analytic, so the model provides a testbed for a ``compare and contrast" discussion of techniques. We give some proofs that are not currently available elsewhere, and also give heuristics for some proven results and for some open problems. Our discussion is centered around three ``foundational" results.
  (i) There is a canonical embedding into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree $\mbox{CTCS}(n)$ on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. The family $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction of $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure $\mbox{CTCS}(\infty)$ formalized via exchangeable partitions, in some ways analogous to the Brownian continuum random tree.
  (ii) There is a CLT for leaf heights, and the analytic proof can be extended to provide surprisingly precise analysis of other height-related aspects.
  (iii) There is an explicit description of the limit {\em fringe distribution} relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies.
  Many open problems remain.</description>
