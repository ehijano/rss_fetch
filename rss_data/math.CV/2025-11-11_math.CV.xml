      <title>An example of a space $L^{p(\cdot)}$ on which the Cauchy-Leray-Fantappi\`{e} operator for complex ellipsoid is not bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an example of a Lebesgue space with variable exponent on which Cauchy-Leray-Fantappi\`{e} operator associated with a complex ellipsoid is not bounded. This result extends previous counterexamples for the unit ball and demonstrates that the logarithmic continuity condition for the exponent function $p(\cdot)$ is sharp even for non-strictly convex domains. The proof is based on an explicit construction of test functions supported near points where the boundary fails to be strictly convex.</description>

      <title>On linear systems of moment differential equations with singularities of the first kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution to systems of moment differential equations of the form $z\partial_my=(zA+B)y$ are provided, for a matrix $B$ with general good spectrum. Existence and convergence of Floquet-type solutions is studied. A generalized definition of $z^B$ is given, as a tool to solve the main problem whenever $A\equiv 0$. The theory is illustrated with examples which are important in applications.</description>

      <title>The asymptoticity of extremal length in Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of extremal length along Teichm\"uller rays. Specifically, we determine the limit of extremal length along a Teichm\"uller ray and obtain an explicit expression for this limit, which complements a related formula established by Cormac Walsh. Building on this result and Kerckhoff's formula, we establish a formula for the limiting Teichm\"uller distance between two points moving along arbitrary pairs of Teichm\"uller rays. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for two Teichm\"uller rays to be asymptotic. Finally, by shifting the initial points of the Teichm\"uller rays along their associated Teichm\"uller geodesics, we show that the minimum of the limiting Teichm\"uller distance coincides with the detour metric between the endpoints of the rays on the horofunction boundary.</description>

      <title>A general comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flows for the right-hand side of the form $dt \wedge d\mu$ where $d\mu$ is dominated by a Monge-Amp\`ere measure of a bounded plurisubharmonic function. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of the weak solution to the pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. We also study the long-term behavior of the solution under some assumption.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Approximation by Finite Blaschke Products and Bounded Universal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper complements the work done on simultaneous approximation results in classical Banach spaces, by focusing on approximation by finite Blaschke products. We prove the existence of a finite Blaschke product that approximates a prescribed holomorphic function bounded by 1 locally uniformly on the unit disc, and simultaneously approximates a prescribed unimodular continuous function uniformly on a compact subset of the unit circle of arclength measure 0. We also prove an analogue where the continuous function is bounded by 1 and the the approximation is achieved by an appropriate dilate of the finite Blaschke product. These results are essentially combinations of classical results of Caratheodory and Fisher on approximation by finite Blaschke products. We also give analogues for singular inner functions. Finally, we apply our results to prove the existence of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc that exhibit a certain universal boundary behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intersection form $F_X$ on the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ of dimension $n$. Although the structure of $F_X$ is relatively well understood in dimensions two and three, much less is known for $n \geq 4$. We investigate the fundamental properties of $F_X$ in higher dimensions and discuss several applications to birational geometry. Finally, we present a number of open problems concerning the relationship between birational invariants and topological invariants of K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hodge theory for local systems and cohomological support loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we pursue two main objectives. The first is to show that the fundamental results of Green-Lazarsfeld (1987, 1991) on generic vanishing theorems, and works of Budur-Wang (2015, 2020) on cohomology jumping loci, can be established within a unified framework based on suitable versions of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma. Our second-and primary-goal is to develop the technical tools required for this approach, namely an $L^2$-Hodge theory for the cohomology of rank-one local systems on quasi-compact K\"ahler manifolds. Further developments concerning higher-rank local systems, as well as several geometric applications, will be presented in a companion paper and are briefly outlined in the introduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most powerful ideas in the study and classification of algebraic varieties is the notion of a model: that is, to single out an object, in the appropriate isomorphism class, with nice properties. This survey aims to define and study suitable models of rational and, more generally, ruled surfaces in the smooth complex case, and to use them to study such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions to Systems of General Quadratic Functional Equations in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to investigate the existence and forms of solutions of systems of general quadratic functional equations in $\mathbb{C}^n$. By utilizing Nevanlinna theory in $\mathbb{C}^n$, we explore the existence and form of solutions for the several systems of general quadratic difference and partial differential-difference equations of the form $af^2 + 2\alpha fg + bg^2 + 2\beta f + 2\gamma g + C=0$, where $f$ and $g$ are non-constant meromorphic functions in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The obtained results in this article are improvements and generalizations of several results from [\textit{RACSAM}, \textbf{116}(8) (2022)]. Furthermore, appropriate remarks and illustrative examples are provided to validate and demonstrate the applicability of the obtained results concerning the existence and forms of solutions for such systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Completely Integrable Foliations: Singular Locus, Invariant Curves and Topological Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study codimension $q \geq 2$ holomorphic foliations defined in a neighborhood of a point $P$ of a complex manifold that are completely integrable, i.e. with $q$ independent meromorphic first integrals. We show that either $P$ is a regular point, a non-isolated singularity or there are infinitely many invariant analytic varieties through $P$ of the same dimension as the foliation, the so called separatrices. Moreover, we see that this phenomenon is of topological nature.
  Indeed, we introduce topological counterparts of completely integrable local holomorphic foliations and tools, specially the concept of total holonomy group, to build holomorphic first integrals if they have isolated separatrices. As a result, we provide a topological characterization of completely integrable non-degenerated elementary isolated singularities of vector fields with an isolated separatrix.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic behavior of singular inner functions in Besov and sequence spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of singular inner functions that are cyclic in some Besov-type spaces of analytic functions over the unit disc. Our sufficient condition is stated only in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the underlying measure. Such singular inner functions are cyclic also in the space $\ell^p_A$ of holomorphic functions with coefficients in $\ell^p$. This can only happen for measures that place no mass on any Beurling-Carleson set.</description>

      <title>Algebroid Mappings and Their Equidistribution Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of algebroid mappings of complex manifolds is introduced based on that a large number of complex systems of PDEs admit multi-valued solutions that can be defined by a system of independent algebraic equations over the field of meromorphic functions. It is well-known that Nevanlinna theory is an important tool in complex ODE theory. To develop a similar tool applied to the study of algebroid solutions of complex systems of PDEs, one explores the equidistribution theory of algebroid mappings. Via uniformizating an algebroid mapping, we obtain a second main theorem of algebroid mappings from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex projective manifold provided that some certain conditions are imposed.</description>

      <title>On the k-th Milnor and k-th Tjurina Numbers of a Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of the $k$-th Milnor number and the $k$-th Tjurina number for a germ of holomorphic foliation on the complex plane with an isolated singularity at the origin. We develop a detailed study of these invariants, establishing explicit formulas and relating them to other indices associated with holomorphic foliations. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation and, as a consequence, a formula for the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function. We analyze their topological behavior, proving that the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function is a topological invariant, whereas the $k$-th Tjurina number is not. In dimension two, we provide a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Hussain, Liu, Yau, and Zuo concerning a sharp lower bound for the $k$-th Tjurina number of a weighted homogeneous polynomial. We also present a counterexample to another conjecture of Hussain, Yau, and Zuo regarding the ratio between these invariants. Moreover, we establish a fundamental relation linking the $k$-th Tjurina numbers of a foliation and of an invariant curve via the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, and we extend Teissier's Lemma to the setting of $k$-th polar intersection numbers. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation in terms of its $k$-th Tjurina number along balanced divisors of separatrices. Finally, for non-dicritical quasi-homogeneous foliations, we obtain a closed formula for their $k$-th Milnor and Tjurina numbers.</description>

      <title>Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous hypersurfaces with non-isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a pair $(\textbf{X},0)$ and $(\textbf{Y},0)$ of hypersurfaces in $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$ parametrized by finitely determined, quasihomogeneous map germs $f$ and $g,$ respectively. Zariski asked whether the multiplicity is preserved under topological equivalence of hypersurface germs. We address this question within a wide class of $n$-dimensional quasihomogeneous varieties with non-isolated singularities in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1},$ where $2\le n\le 4.$ This class consists of varieties that arise as image of finitely determined, quasihomogeneous map germs. Using a quasihomogeneous normal form, we derive explicit formulas for the multiplicity in terms of the weights and the degrees of the map germ. Our results show that multiplicity, within this setting, is determined by the weighted data and is invariant under topological equivalence, thereby confirming Zariski's multiplicity conjecture and extending current knowledge beyond the isolated singularity case.</description>

      <title>On reflection maps from the n-space to the n+1-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider some problems about a reflected graph map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$. A reflected graph map is a particular case of a reflection map, which is defined using an embedding of $\mathbb{C}^n$ in $\mathbb{C}^{p}$ and then applying the action of a reflection group $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^{p}$. In this work, we present a description of the presentation matrix of $f_*{\cal O}_n$ as an ${\cal O}_{n+1}$-module via $f$ in terms of the action of the associated reflection group $G$. We also give a description for a defining equation of the image of $f$ in terms of the action of $G$. Finally, we provide an upper (and also a lower) bound for the multiplicity of the image of $f$ and some applications.</description>

      <title>On the Practical Use of Blaschke Decomposition in Nonstationary Signal Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Blaschke decomposition-based algorithm, {\em Phase Dynamics Unwinding} (PDU), possesses several attractive theoretical properties, including fast convergence, effective decomposition, and multiscale analysis. However, its application to real-world signal decomposition tasks encounters notable challenges. In this work, we propose two techniques, divide-and-conquer via tapering and cumulative summation (cumsum), to handle complex trends and amplitude modulations and the mode-mixing caused by winding. The resulting method, termed {\em windowed PDU}, enhances PDU's performance in practical decomposition tasks. We validate our approach through both simulated and real-world signals, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the zeros and critical points of different indices of the standard Gaussian entire function on the complex plane (whose zero set is stationary). We provide asymptotics for the second order correlations of all the corresponding number statistics on small observation disks, showing various rates of local repulsion. The results have consequences for signal processing, as they show extremely strong repulsion between the local maxima and zeros of spectrograms of noise computed with respect to Gaussian windows.</description>

      <title>Norm of the Ces\`aro operator between some spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the exact norm of the Ces\`aro operator $\mathcal{C}$ on the Korenblum space $H^\infty_\alpha$ for $0 &lt; \alpha \leq \frac12$ and on the logarithmically weighted space $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$ for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. Moreover, we compute its norm when acting from $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$ to $H^\infty_\alpha$. Finally, we establish lower and upper bounds for the norm of $\mathcal{C}$ on the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$, and from the Hardy space $H^\infty$ to $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ for $\alpha\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Helson's conjecture for smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of connections on rational irregular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the compactification of the moduli space of a certain class of rank-two irregular connections on the Riemann sphere, presenting one double pole and two simple poles. To explicitely build the compactification, we identify a class of such irregular connections with a rational irregular curve and an extra complex parameter. As a first step, we are inspired by Deligne and Mumford's work to compactify the moduli space of rational irregular curves, introducing the notion of irregular stable nodal curve. Second, we will understand the behaviour of the extra complex parameter to conclude the compactification.</description>
