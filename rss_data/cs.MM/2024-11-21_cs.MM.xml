      <title>TopoCode: Topologically Informed Error Detection and Correction in Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional error detection and correction codes focus on bit-level fidelity, which is insufficient for emerging technologies like eXtended Reality (XR) and holographic communications requiring high-data-rate, low-latency systems. Bit-level metrics cannot comprehensively evaluate Quality-of-Service (QoS) in these scenarios. This letter proposes TopoCode which leverages Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and persistent homology to encode topological information for message-level error detection and correction. It introduces minimal redundancy while enabling effective data reconstruction, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. TopoCode offers a promising approach to meet the demands of next-generation communication systems prioritizing semantic accuracy and message-level integrity.</description>

      <title>Narrative Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an information-theoretic framework to measure narratives, providing a formalism to understand pivotal moments, cliffhangers, and plot twists. This approach offers creatives and AI researchers tools to analyse and benchmark human- and AI-created stories. We illustrate our method in TV shows, showing its ability to quantify narrative complexity and emotional dynamics across genres. We discuss applications in media and in human-in-the-loop generative AI storytelling.</description>

      <title>VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</description>

      <title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

      <title>Word-level Sign Language Recognition with Multi-stream Neural Networks Focusing on Local Regions and Skeletal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) has attracted attention because it is expected to overcome the communication barrier between people with speech impairment and those who can hear. In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</description>
