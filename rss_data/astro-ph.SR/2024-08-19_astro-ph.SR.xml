      <title>Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the supernova Ia hypervelocity runaway white dwarf J0927-6335</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot white dwarf (WD) J0927-6335 (Gaia DR3 5250394728194220800, effective temperature T$_{\rm eff}$ = 60,000 K, surface gravity log g = 7) was detected as the fastest known Galactic hypervelocity star with a space velocity of $\approx$2800 km s$^{-1}$ and an atmosphere dominated by carbon and oxygen. It is thought to be the surviving WD donor predicted by the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D$^6$) type Ia supernova formation model. We analysed an ultraviolet spectrum of J0927-6335 obtained recently with the Hubble Space Telescope and found very high abundances of iron and nickel. This could originate in the pollution of the remnant by the SN Ia explosion but it is uncertain to what extent atomic diffusion altered the chemical composition of the accreted material.</description>

      <title>Splitting and eruption of an active region filament caused by magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain a deeper understanding of the intricate process of filament eruption, we present a case study of a filament splitting and eruption by using multi-wavelength data of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It is found that the magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic loops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted successively. The observational evidences of magnetic reconnection, such as the obvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the appearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were clearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed eruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the filaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested that magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the original filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments. Furthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic reconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-deck filament formation.</description>

      <title>The formation of black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars is not trivial: Simulations of thermonuclear pulsations and explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation and evolution of rapidly accreting supermassive stars has received significant attention in the hope of better understanding the origin of high redshift quasars. It is often taken for granted that once formed, these supermassive stars will encounter the general relativistic radial instability and collapse to form massive black holes. Here, we present the first ever general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of rapidly accreting supermassive stars. We find that black hole formation is in many cases prevented by nuclear burning due to the long timescales of the collapse of these stars ($10^6$ s). Consequently, this is a novel astrophysical site for hot CNO burning and hydrogen burning via proton captures. For Pop III accreting supermassive stars, we find that only stars with very high (100 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) or low (0.1 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) accretion rates can form black holes, with models in between undergoing energetic thermonuclear pulsations. The final fate of these pulsating models may be to undergo subsequent pulsations or explosions or to collapse to black holes. For metal rich accreting supermassive stars ($Z\geq 0.1 \rm{Z_\odot}$), we do not find any black hole formation, with some models undergoing extremely energetic explosions ($10^{55}$ ergs). Our results invite further study on the formation of massive black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars which have reached the general relativistic radial instability.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical Estimates of the Cosmic Planet Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise and exploit a data-driven, semi-empirical framework of galaxy formation and evolution, coupling it to recipes for planet formation from stellar and planetary science, to compute the cosmic planet formation rate, and the properties of the planets' preferred host stellar and galactic environments. We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are affected when considering their habitability, and when including possible threatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we conservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like planets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally, we find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which places a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world to ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.</description>

      <title>Wide post-common envelope binaries from Gaia: orbit validation and formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometry from {\it Gaia} DR3 has enabled the discovery of a sample of 3000+ binaries containing white dwarfs (WD) and main-sequence (MS) stars in relatively wide orbits, with orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} = (100-1000)$ d. This population was not predicted by binary population synthesis models before {\it Gaia} and -- if the {\it Gaia} orbits are robust -- likely requires very efficient envelope ejection during common envelope evolution (CEE). To assess the reliability of the {\it Gaia} solutions, we measured multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) of 31 WD+MS binary candidates with $P_{\rm orb} = (40-300)$ d and \texttt{AstroSpectroSB1} orbital solutions. We jointly fit the RVs and astrometry, allowing us to validate the {\it Gaia} solutions and tighten constraints on component masses. We find a high success rate for the {\it Gaia} solutions, with only 2 out of the 31 systems showing significant discrepancies between their {\it Gaia} orbital solutions and our RVs. Joint fitting of RVs and astrometry allows us to directly constrain the secondary-to-primary flux ratio $S$, and we find $S\lesssim 0.02$ for most objects, confirming the companions are indeed WDs. We tighten constraints on the binaries' eccentricities, finding a median $e\approx 0.1$. These eccentricities are much lower than those of normal MS+MS binaries at similar periods, but much higher than predicted for binaries formed via stable mass transfer. We present MESA single and binary evolution models to explore how the binaries may have formed. The orbits of most binaries in the sample can be produced through CEE that begins when the WD progenitor is an AGB star, corresponding to initial separations of $2-5$ au. Roughly 50\% of all post-common envelope binaries are predicted to have first interacted on the AGB, ending up in wide orbits like these systems.</description>

      <title>Jets from the Upper Scorpius Variable Young Star System 2MASS J16075796-2040087 Via KECK/HIRES Spectro-astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2MASS J16075796-2040087 is a ~ 5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multi-component forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ~ 4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a MHD disk wind is present. The FEL high velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ~ 700 au long. The jet's position angle (PA) ~ 277 degrees is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component (LVC), is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify a MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.</description>

      <title>YOUNG Star detrending for Transiting Exoplanet Recovery (YOUNGSTER) -- I. A search for young exoplanets in Sectors 1-5 of the TESS Full-Frame-Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young (&lt;1Gyr) exoplanets represent a critically important area of exoplanet research, as they offer the opportunity to learn about the formation and early dynamic history of exoplanetary systems. However, finding young exoplanets is significantly complicated by the fast rotation and complex activity of their young host stars, which are often not well handled by state-of-the-art automatic pipelines. This work presents an alternative LOWESS-based pipeline focused specifically on detrending young stellar light-curves from the 30min-cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs) produced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$), and includes improvements such as automatic peak-cutting of stellar variability and interpolation over masked transits to improve periodogram visibility and returned transit shapes. This work presents the details of the developed pipeline, along with initial results from its application to young stars within stellar associations in sectors 1-5 of the $TESS$ data. While no new exoplanet candidate signals were found in this work, interesting results included the recovery of all known 2min TOIs around young stars in sectors 1-5 from 30min data alone, the recovery of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab, a number of young eclipsing binaries and a wide array of interesting rotation. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for each star, showing how recovery of injected planets varied with both depth and period for each individual target. Challenges for future searches for young exoplanets are discussed, the largest being stellar rotation with periods less than 1 day and a lack of a large sample of confirmed young stars.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Proton and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of non-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.</description>

      <title>A Testbed for Tidal Migration: the 3D Architecture of an Eccentric Hot Jupiter HD 118203 b Accompanied by a Possibly Aligned Outer Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.79^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=6.23^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ AU) exterior to a close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocities. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10.0}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true spin-orbit angle of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is one of first hot Jupiter systems where both the true spin-orbit angle of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Accretion Flows -- ALMAGAL: Flows along filamentary structures in high-mass star-forming clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1 arsecond resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6 kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and HII regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/HII region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.</description>
