      <title>Dynamics of Liquidity Surfaces in Uniswap v3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the empirical dynamics of Uniswap v3 liquidity, which we model as a time-tick surface, $L_t(x)$. Using a combination of functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and dynamic factor methods, we analyze three distinct pools over multiple sample periods. Our findings offer three main contributions: a statistical characterization of automated market maker liquidity, an interpretable and portable basis for dimension reduction, and a robust analysis of liquidity dynamics using rolling window metrics. For the 5 bps pools, the leading empirical eigenfunctions explain the majority of cross-tick variation and remain stable, aligning closely with a low-order Legendre polynomial basis. This alignment provides a parsimonious and interpretable structure, similar to the dynamic Nelson-Siegel method for yield curves. The factor coefficients exhibit a time series structure well-captured by AR(1) models with clear GARCH-type heteroskedasticity and heavy-tailed innovations.</description>

      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility II: An Artificial Market Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends and complements our previous theoretical paper on the subtle interplay between impact, order flow and volatility. In the present paper, we generate synthetic market data following the specification of that paper and show that the approximations made there are actually justified, which provides quantitative support our conclusion that price volatility can be fully explained by the superposition of correlated metaorders which all impact prices, on average, as a square-root of executed volume. One of the most striking predictions of our model is the structure of the correlation between generalized order flow and returns, which is observed empirically and reproduced using our synthetic market generator. Furthermore, we were able to construct proxy metaorders from our simulated order flow that reproduce the square-root law of market impact, lending further credence to the proposal made in Ref. [2] to measure the impact of real metaorders from tape data (i.e. anonymized trades), which was long thought to be impossible.</description>

      <title>MM-DREX: Multimodal-Driven Dynamic Routing of LLM Experts for Financial Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent non-stationarity of financial markets and the complexity of multi-modal information pose significant challenges to existing quantitative trading models. Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal data struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model (LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from static strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment and fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose MM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on large language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception from strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language model (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart patterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights; (2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout, positioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3) proposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the router's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted decision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks, futures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly outperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep reinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization. Additionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert behavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.</description>

      <title>Painting the market: generative diffusion models for financial limit order book simulation and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating limit order books (LOBs) has important applications across forecasting and backtesting for financial market data. However, deep generative models struggle in this context due to the high noise and complexity of the data. Previous work uses autoregressive models, although these experience error accumulation over longer-time sequences. We introduce a novel approach, converting LOB data into a structured image format, and applying diffusion models with inpainting to generate future LOB states. This method leverages spatio-temporal inductive biases in the order book and enables parallel generation of long sequences overcoming issues with error accumulation. We also publicly contribute to LOB-Bench, the industry benchmark for LOB generative models, to allow fair comparison between models using Level-2 and Level-3 order book data (with or without message level data respectively). We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on LOB-Bench, despite using lower fidelity data as input. We also show that our method prioritises coherent global structures over local, high-fidelity details, providing significant improvements over existing methods on certain metrics. Overall, our method lays a strong foundation for future research into generative diffusion approaches to LOB modelling.</description>

      <title>MountainLion: A Multi-Modal LLM-Based Agent System for Interpretable and Adaptive Financial Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.</description>
