      <title>Discretization-free Bayesian inverse problems in distribution spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian approach to inverse problems provides a practical way to solve ill-posed problems by augmenting the observation model with prior information. Due to the measure-theoretic underpinnings, the approach has raised theoretical interest, leading to a rather comprehensive description in infinite-dimensional function spaces. The goal of this article is to bridge the infinite-dimensional theory for linear inverse problems in distribution spaces and associated computational inverse problems without resorting to a discrete approximation of the forward model. We will shown that under certain assumptions, discretization of the unknown of interest is not necessary for the numerical treatment of the problem, the only approximations required being numerical quadratures that are independent of any discrete representation of the unknown. An analysis of the connection between the proposed approach and discretization-based ones is also provided.</description>

      <title>Low-rank approximation of Rippa method for RBF interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting the shape parameter in Radial Basis function (RBF) interpolation using leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). Since the classical LOOCV formula requires repeated solves with a dense $N \times N$ kernel matrix, we combine a Nystr\"{o}m approximation with the Woodbury identity to obtain an efficient surrogate objective that avoids large matrix inversions. Based on this reduced form, we compare a grid-based search with a gradient descent strategy and examine their behavior across different dimensions. Numerical experiments are performed in 1D, 2D, and 3D using the Inverse Multiquadratic RBF to illustrate the computational advantages of the approximation as well as the situations in which it may introduce additional sensitivity. These results show that the proposed acceleration makes LOOCV-based parameter tuning practical for larger datasets while preserving the qualitative behavior of the full method.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Long-Time Stable Variable-Step Second-Order Exponential Time-Differencing Schemes for the Incompressible NSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient, unconditionally stable, variable step second order exponential time differencing scheme for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in two and three spatial dimensions under periodic boundary conditions, together with an embedded adaptive time stepping variant. The scheme is unconditionally uniform in time stable in the sense that the numerical solution admits a time uniform bound in Linfinity over time with values in L2 to the power d whenever the external forcing term is uniformly bounded in time in L2, for all Reynolds numbers and for arbitrary choices of time step sizes.
  At each time step, the method requires the solution of two time dependent Stokes problems, which can be evaluated explicitly in the periodic setting using Fourier techniques, along with the solution of a single scalar cubic algebraic equation. Beyond the standard exponential time differencing framework, the proposed scheme incorporates two recently developed ingredients. The first is a dynamic second order scalar auxiliary variable correction, which is essential for achieving second order temporal accuracy. The second is a mean reverting scalar auxiliary variable multistep formulation, which plays a central role in ensuring long time stability.
  The proposed methods overcome key limitations of existing approaches for the Navier Stokes equations. Classical Runge Kutta schemes generally lack provable long time stability, while IMEX and scalar auxiliary variable based BDF methods typically do not admit unconditional stability guarantees in the variable step setting. Numerical experiments in two spatial dimensions confirm second order temporal accuracy, uniform long time stability, and effective error control provided by the adaptive strategy. Rigorous convergence analysis and a systematic investigation of long time statistical properties will be pursued in future work.</description>

      <title>Blind source separation for imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the problem of blind source separation and its applications to imaging. We first establish a theoretical result that we stated in our previous article on imaging in diffusive environments. This result is a generalization of separability criteria found in the literature to arbitrary correlated complex-valued sources with additive noise. In a second step, we verify these separability conditions in two propagation regimes frequently encountered in imaging: the speckle regime and the random geometrical optics regime. Finally, we propose a new imaging method based on the blind source separation problem that improves on images obtained with the classical decomposition of the time reversal operator method.</description>

      <title>Impact of Separation Distance on the Performance and Annual Energy Production of a Dual-Flap Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the different concepts for wave energy conversion, oscillating surge wave energy converters have been shown to have a high capture width ratio. The primary wave capture structure consists of a flap hinged at the seabed or to a floating platform. Different flap configurations, including single and dual-flap, have been investigated. The separation distance between the oscillating surge wave energy converters can have an impact on their response when deployed in arrays. We consider the case of a dual-flap oscillating surge wave energy converter and investigate the impact of the separation distance between them on the performance of each flap. We estimate the absorbed wave energy and the annual energy production by the two flaps when deployed at the PacWave South site. Inviscid numerical simulations were conducted to predict the response of the oscillating surge wave energy converters. The simulations are validated with experimental measurements of a 1:10 scaled model in a wave tank. The results show that for a short separation distance, the interaction between the oscillating surge wave energy converters has a destructive and constructive effect depending on the wave frequency. However, these effects tend to balance each other out when considering the broad range of wave excitations. For longer separation distances, the interaction always results in a constructive effect. The results reveal that the separation distance has an insignificant impact on annual energy production when considering all wave frequencies and amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Analysis of Sketched Linear Squares Problems and Stopping Criteria for Iterative Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized subspace embedding methods have had a great impact on the solution of a linear least squares (LS) problem by reducing its row dimension, leading to a randomized or sketched LS (sLS) problem, and use the solution of the sLS problem as an approximate solution of the LS problem. This work makes a numerical analysis on the sLS problem, establishes its numerous theoretical properties, and show their crucial roles on the most effective and efficient use of iterative solvers. We first establish a compact bound on the norm of the residual difference between the solutions of the LS and sLS problems, which is the first key result towards understanding the rationale of the sLS problem. Then from the perspective of backward errors, we prove that the solution of the sLS problem is the one of a certain perturbed LS problem with minimal backward error, and quantify how the embedded quality affects the residuals, solution errors, and the relative residual norms of normal equations of the LS and sLS problems. These theoretical results enable us to propose new novel and reliable general-purpose stopping criteria for iterative solvers for the sLS problem, which dynamically monitor stabilization patterns of iterative solvers for the LS problem itself and terminate them at the earliest iteration. Numerical experiments justify the theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the new stopping criteria work reliably and result in a tremendous reduction in computational cost without sacrificing attainable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Identifying the source term in a viscoelastic membrane with a Riemann-Liouville time derivative by the partial interior observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an inverse source problem for a viscoelastic membrane, where the material's memory effect is characterized by the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. The problem is to recover the unknown source term from the limited interior observation data. We propose an optimal control framework to address this ill-posed inverse problem. The first-order optimality condition leads to a coupled system of forward and backward fractional partial differential equations. A numerical algorithm combining the finite element method and a conjugate gradient iterative scheme is then developed for the reconstruction of the source term. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solving PDEs in One Shot via Fourier Features with Exact Analytical Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent random feature methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) reduce computational cost compared to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) but still rely on iterative optimization or expensive derivative computation. We observe that sinusoidal random Fourier features possess a cyclic derivative structure: the derivative of any order of $\sin(\mathbf{W}\cdot\mathbf{x}+b)$ is a single sinusoid with a monomial prefactor, computable in $O(1)$ operations. Alternative activations such as $\tanh$, used in prior one-shot methods like PIELM, lack this property: their higher-order derivatives grow as $O(2^n)$ terms, requiring automatic differentiation for operator assembly. We propose FastLSQ, which combines frozen random Fourier features with analytical operator assembly to solve linear PDEs via a single least-squares call, and extend it to nonlinear PDEs via Newton--Raphson iteration where each linearized step is a FastLSQ solve. On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Stable, Bound-Preserving and Locally Conservative Numerical Framework for Multicomponent Gas Flow in Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient numerical framework for simulating multicomponent gas flow in poroelastic media, with a focus on preserving fundamental thermodynamic principles and ensuring computational reliability. The model captures the complex nonlinear coupling between multicomponent transport and solid deformation, while addressing critical numerical challenges such as mass conservation, energy stability, and molar density boundedness. To achieve this, we develop a stabilized discretization approach that guarantees the preservation of the original energy dissipation law and ensures the boundedness of each gas component's molar density. Furthermore, the proposed method incorporates an adaptive time-stepping strategy that dynamically adjusts the time step size based on the system's dynamics, significantly enhancing computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy. For spatial discretization, a mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed for the flow and transport equations to ensure local mass conservation, while a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is utilized for discretizing the momentum equation of poroelasticity to effectively overcome numerical locking phenomena. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance, robustness, and applicability of the method in simulating multicomponent gas flow under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a scheme for a two dimensional nonlocal system of transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically study a two-dimensional system modeling the dynamics of dislocation densities. This system is hyperbolic, but not strictly hyperbolic, and couples two non-local transport equations. It is characterized by weak regularity in both the velocity and the initial data. We propose a semi-explicit finite difference (IMEX) numerical scheme for the discretization of this system, after regularizing the singular velocity using a Fej\'er kernel. We show that this scheme preserves, at the discrete level, an entropy estimate on the gradient, which then allows us to establish the convergence of the discrete solution to the continuous solution. To our knowledge, this is the first convergence result obtained for this type of system. We conclude with some numerical illustrations highlighting the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Numerical Accuracy in Mixed-Precision Computing by Dual-Delta Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-precision computing has become increasingly important in modern high-performance computing and machine learning applications. When implementing custom mixed-precision functions -- such as fused operators, optimized GPU kernels, or quantized inference paths -- it is critical to verify their numerical accuracy. Traditional approaches typically compare the custom implementation against a reference using a single error metric. However, this single-delta approach provides limited insight into whether the observed errors are inherent to the precision level or specific to the implementation. This paper introduces \textit{Dual-Delta Testing}, a systematic methodology that evaluates two error distributions against a high-precision oracle, enabling rigorous comparison between a custom implementation and a baseline reference. We present the mathematical framework, algorithmic formulation, statistical analysis techniques, and practical examples demonstrating the methodology's effectiveness in evaluating numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Energy Stable Structure Preserving Method for The Landau-Lifshitz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main difficulties in micromagnetics simulation is the norm preserving constraints $\|\mathbf{m}\|=1$ at the continuous or the discrete level. Another difficulty is the stability with the time step constraint. Using standard explicit integrators leads to a physical time step of sub-pico seconds, which is often two orders of magnitude smaller than the fastest physical time scales. Direct implicit integrators require solving complicated, coupled systems. Another major difficulty with the projection method in this field is the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding its stability of the projection step. In this paper, we introduce a first order method. Such a method is structure preserving based on a combination of a Gauss-Seidel iteration, a double diffusion iteration and a Crank-Nicolson iteration to preserve the norm constraints.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic TR-BDF2 Scheme of Order 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main objective in this paper is to develop a second-order stochastic numerical method which generalizes the well-known deterministic TR-BDF2 scheme. Since most stochastic techniques used for approximating the solution of a stochastic differential equation may have lower order compared to the deterministic case, we have elaborated a scheme which not only preserves the second-order accuracy of the original scheme in the stochastic framework, but also its $A$-stability. Once we obtain the scheme and prove its second-order accuracy and $A$-stability, which is not a trivial task, we also state a result concerning its $MS$-stability. This concept is also analyzed for different parameter ranges in our scheme and the It{\^o}--Taylor approximation of order 2, revealing scenarios where, for certain time step sizes, the developed method is $MS$-stable while the It{\^o}--Taylor one is not. This concept is really useful to tackle slow-fast problems such as stiff ones, which we aim to explore further in future work. Finally, we validate the theoretical results with some academic test cases.</description>

      <title>Why summation by parts is not enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the construction and performance of summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, which offer a powerful framework for the systematic development of structure-preserving numerical discretizations of partial differential equations. Previous approaches for the construction of SBP operators have usually relied on either local methods or sparse differentiation matrices, as commonly used in finite difference schemes. However, these methods often impose implicit requirements that are not part of the formal SBP definition. We demonstrate that adherence to the SBP definition alone does not guarantee the desired accuracy, and we identify conditions for SBP operators to achieve both accuracy and stability. Specifically, we analyze the error minimization for an augmented basis, discuss the role of sparsity, and examine the importance of nullspace consistency in the construction of SBP operators. Furthermore, we show how these design criteria can be integrated into a recently proposed optimization-based construction procedure for function space SBP (FSBP) operators on arbitrary grids. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the improved accuracy for the numerical solution using the proposed SBP operators.</description>

      <title>bound-preserving Adaptive Time-Stepping Method with Energy Stability for Simulating Compressible Gas Flow in Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient numerical method to address a thermodynamically consistent gas flow model in porous media involving compressible gas and deformable rock. The accurate modeling of gas flow in porous media often poses significant challenges due to their inherent nonlinearity, the coupling between gas and rock dynamics, and the need to preserve physical principles such as mass conservation, energy dissipation and molar density boundedness. The system is further complicated by the need to balance computational efficiency with the accuracy and stability of the numerical scheme. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a stabilization approach that is able to preserve the original energy dissipation while achieving linear energy-stable numerical schemes. We also prove the convergence of the adopted linear iterative method. At each time step, the stabilization parameter is adaptively updated using a simple and explicit formula to ensure compliance with the original energy dissipation law. The proposed method uses adaptive time stepping to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy and boundedness. The adaptive time step size is calculated explicitly at each iteration, ensuring stability and allowing for efficient handling of highly dynamic scenarios. A mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed as spatial discretization to ensure mass conservation and stability. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to validate the performance and robustness of the proposed numerical method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Methods for Friedrichs Systems with Application to Scalar and Vector Diffusion-Advection Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study arbitrary-order hybrid discretizations of Friedrichs systems. Friedrichs systems provide a framework that goes beyond the standard classification of partial differential equations into hyperbolic or elliptic, and are thus particularly suited for problems that include both diffusive and advective terms. The family of numerical schemes proposed in this work hinge on hybrid spaces with unknowns located at elements and faces. They support general meshes, are locally conservative and, compared with traditional Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, lead to smaller algebraic systems once static condensation has been applied. We carry out a complete stability and convergence analysis, which appears to be the first of its kind. The performance of the method is illustrated on scalar and vector three-dimensional diffusion-advection-reaction problems.</description>

      <title>Drift-Randomized Milstein-Galerkin Finite Element Method for Semilinear Stochastic Evolution Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kruse and Wu [Math. Comp. 88 (2019) 2793--2825] proposed a fully discrete randomized Galerkin finite element method for semilinear stochastic evolution equations (SEEs) driven by additive noise and showed that this method attains a temporal strong convergence rate exceeding order $\frac{1}{2}$ without imposing any differentiability assumptions on the drift nonlinearity. They further discussed a potential extension of the randomized method to SEEs with multiplicative noise and introduced the so-called drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element fully discrete scheme, but without providing a corresponding strong convergence analysis.
  This paper aims to fill this gap by rigorously analyzing the strong convergence behavior of the drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element scheme. By avoiding the use of differentiability assumptions on the nonlinear drift term, we establish strong convergence rates in both space and time for the proposed method. The obtained temporal convergence rate is $O(\Delta t^{1-\varepsilon_0})$, where $\Delta t$ denotes the time step size and $\varepsilon_0$ is an arbitrarily small positive number. Numerical experiments are reported to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the potential energy for different equilibrium configurations of symmetric and asymmetric floating drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a numerical method for computing solutions to a free boundary problem arising from the equilibrium state of a floating drop. This numerical method is based on a Newton's method for the underlying nonlinear boundary value problems, and at each iterative step a Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed. The problems considered here are those that can be described by using generating curves, and include problems in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  The resulting nine-dimensional space of physical parameters is explored, and examples are given that highlight the potential energy of centrally located drops, wall-bound drops, and asymmetrical configurations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Non-uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations is displayed, and also strong evidence of non-uniqueness of energy minimizers is given.</description>

      <title>Relationships between full-space and subspace quadratic interpolation models and simplex derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic interpolation models and simplex derivatives are fundamental tools in numerical optimization, particularly in derivative-free optimization. When constructed in suitably chosen affine subspaces, these tools have been shown to be especially effective for high-dimensional derivative-free optimization problems, where full-space model construction is often impractical. In this paper, we analyze the relationships between full-space and subspace formulations of these tools. In particular, we derive explicit conversion formulas between full-space and subspace models, including minimum-norm models, minimum Frobenius norm models, least Frobenius norm updating models, as well as models constructed via generalized simplex gradients and Hessians. We show that the full-space and subspace models coincide on the affine subspace and, in general, along directions in the orthogonal complement. Overall, our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding subspace approximation techniques and offer insight into the design and analysis of derivative-free optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Compression-Precision Paradox: A Hybrid Architecture for Clinical EEG Report Generation with Guaranteed Measurement Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.
  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.</description>

      <title>Block encoding of sparse matrices with a periodic diagonal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block encoding is a successful technique used in several powerful quantum algorithms. In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $\omega$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Variational Integrator for the Geometrically Exact Rod with Circular Cross-Section Incorporating Cross-Sectional Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the continuous space-time equations of motion of a three-dimensional geometrically exact rod, or the Cosserat rod, incorporating planar cross-sectional deformation. We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system.</description>

      <title>Noise-balanced multilevel on-the-fly sparse grid surrogates for coupling Monte Carlo models into continuum models with application to heterogeneous catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations.</description>

      <title>Large Scale High-Dimensional Reduced-Rank Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-rank linear discriminant analysis (RRLDA) is a foundational method of dimension reduction for classification that has been useful in a wide range of applications. The goal is to identify an optimal subspace to project the observations onto that simultaneously maximizes between-group variation while minimizing within-group differences. The solution is straight forward when the number of observations is greater than the number of features but computational difficulties arise in both the high-dimensional setting, where there are more features than there are observations, and when the data are very large. Many works have proposed solutions for the high-dimensional setting and frequently involve additional assumptions or tuning parameters. We propose a fast and simple iterative algorithm for both classical and high-dimensional RRLDA on large data that is free from these additional requirements and that comes with guarantees. We also explain how RRLDA-RK provides implicit regularization towards the least norm solution without explicitly incorporating penalties. We demonstrate our algorithm on real data and highlight some results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix evolution equations occur in many applications, such as dynamical Lyapunov/Sylvester systems or Riccati equations in optimization and stochastic control, machine learning or data assimilation. In many such problems, the dominant stability restriction is imposed by a stiff linear term, making standard explicit integrators impractical. Exponential time differencing (ETD) is known to produce highly stable numerical schemes by treating the linear term in an exact fashion. In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are the methods of choice. We extend ETD to matrix-valued evolution equations of the form $\dot Q = LQ + QR + N(Q,t)$ by deriving explicit matrix-ETD (METD) schemes. When $L$ and $R$ commute, we construct an explicit $p$-th order METD$p$ family and prove order-$p$ global convergence under standard assumptions; for the non-commuting case, we develop a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-based extension. This allows us to produce highly efficient and stable integration schemes. We demonstrate efficiency and applicability on stiff PDE-derived and large-scale matrix dynamics, including an Allen-Cahn system, turbulent jet fluctuation statistics, and continuous graph neural networks. We further show that the scheme is more accurate, stable, and efficient than competing schemes in large-scale high-rank stiff systems.</description>

      <title>Multigrid Monte Carlo Revisited: Theory and Bayesian Inference</title>

Abstract: Gaussian random fields play an important role in many areas of science and engineering. In practice, they are often simulated by sampling from a high-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, which arises from the discretisation of a suitable precision operator. Existing methods such as Cholesky factorization and Gibbs sampling become prohibitively expensive on fine meshes due to their high computational cost. In this work, we revisit the Multigrid Monte Carlo (MGMC) algorithm developed by Goodman &amp; Sokal (Physical Review D 40.6, 1989) in the quantum physics context. While the authors of this paper conclude that MGMC does not overcome critical slowing down in simulations of field theories near phase transitions, we demonstrate here that it has the potential to significantly accelerate sampling in spatial statistics. The class of Gaussian Random Fields we consider includes those with Mat\'{e}rn covariance, but is more general in that it also allows for non-stationary covariance functions. To show that MGMC can overcome the limitation of existing methods, we establish a grid-size-independent convergence theory based on the link between linear solvers and samplers for multivariate normal distributions, drawing on standard multigrid convergence arguments. We then apply this theory to linear Bayesian inverse problems. This application is achieved by extending the standard multigrid theory to operators with a low-rank perturbation. Moreover, we develop a novel bespoke random smoother which takes care of the low-rank updates that arise in constructing posterior moments. In particular, we prove that Multigrid Monte Carlo is algorithmically optimal in the limit of the grid-size going to zero. Numerical results support our theory, demonstrating that Multigrid Monte Carlo can be significantly more efficient than alternative methods when applied in a Bayesian setting.</description>

Abstract: We describe a mesh-free three-dimensional numerical scheme for solving the incompressible semi-geostrophic equations based on semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. These results generalise previous two-dimensional implementations. The optimal transport methods we adopt are known for their structural preservation and energy conservation qualities and achieve an excellent level of efficiency and numerical energy-conservation. We use this scheme to generate numerical simulations of an important cyclone benchmark problem. To our knowledge, this is the first fully three-dimensional simulation of the semi-geostrophic equations, evidencing semi-discrete optimal transport as a novel, robust numerical tool for meteorological and oceanographic modelling.</description>

      <title>Enriching continuous Lagrange finite element approximation spaces using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study combining two approaches in the context of solving PDEs: the continuous finite element method (FEM) and more recent techniques based on neural networks. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become particularly interesting for rapidly solving PDEs, especially in high dimensions. However, their lack of accuracy can be a significant drawback in this context, hence the interest in combining them with FEM, for which error estimates are already known. The complete pipeline proposed here consists in modifying the classical FEM approximation spaces by taking information from a prior, chosen as the prediction of a neural network. On the one hand, this combination improves and certifies the prediction of neural networks, to obtain a fast and accurate solution. On the other hand, error estimates are proven, showing that such strategies outperform classical ones by a factor that depends only on the quality of the prior. We validate our approach with numerical results performed on parametric problems with 1D, 2D and 3D geometries. These experiments demonstrate that to achieve a given accuracy, a coarser mesh can be used with our enriched FEM compared to the standard FEM, leading to reduced computational time, particularly for parametric problems.</description>

Abstract: We present a hybrid method combining a minimizing movement scheme with neural operators for the simulation of phase field-based Willmore flow. The minimizing movement component is based on a standard optimization problem on a regular grid whereas the functional to be minimized involves a neural approximation of mean curvature flow proposed by Bretin et al. Numerical experiments confirm stability for large time step sizes, consistency and significantly reduced computational cost compared to a traditional finite element method. Moreover, applications demonstrate its effectiveness in surface fairing and reconstructing of damaged shapes. Thus, the approach offers a robust and efficient tool for geometry processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show error bounds for randomly subsampled rank-1 lattices. We pay particular attention to the ratio of the size of the subset to the size of the initial lattice, which is decisive for the computational complexity. In the special case of Korobov spaces, we achieve the optimal polynomial sampling complexity whilst having the smallest initial lattice possible. We further characterize the frequency index set for which a given lattice is reconstructing by using the reciprocal of the worst-case error achieved using the lattice in question. This connects existing approaches used in proving error bounds for lattices. We make detailed comments on the implementation and test different algorithms using the subsampled lattice in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring Exponential Runge-Kutta Methods: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth investigation of exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the numerical integration of initial-value problems. These methods offer a valuable synthesis between classical Runge-Kutta methods, introduced more than a century ago, and exponential integrators, which date back to the 1960s. This manuscript presents both a historical analysis of the development of these methods up to the present day and several examples aimed at making the topic accessible to a broad audience.</description>

      <title>A robust computational framework for the mixture-energy-consistent six-equation two-phase model with instantaneous mechanical relaxation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust computational framework for the numerical solution of a hyperbolic 6-equation single-velocity two-phase system. The system's main interest is that, when combined with instantaneous mechanical relaxation, it recovers the solution of the 5-equation model of Kapila. Several numerical methods based on this strategy have been developed over the years. However, neither the 5- nor 6-equation model admits a complete set of jump conditions because they involve non-conservative products. Different discretizations of these terms in the 6-equation model exist. The precise impact of these discretizations on the numerical solutions of the 5-equation model, in particular for shocks, is still an open question to which this work provides new insights. We consider the phasic total energies as prognostic variables to naturally enforce discrete conservation of total energy and compare the accuracy and robustness of different discretizations for the hyperbolic operator. Namely, we discuss the construction of an HLLC approximate Riemann solver in relation to jump conditions. We then compare an HLLC wave-propagation scheme which includes the non-conservative terms, with Rusanov and HLLC solvers for the conservative part in combination with suitable approaches for the non-conservative terms. We show that some approaches for the discretization of non-conservative terms fit within the framework of path-conservative schemes for hyperbolic problems. We then analyze the use of various numerical strategies on several relevant test cases, showing both the impact of the theoretical shortcomings of the models as well as the importance of the choice of a robust framework for the global numerical strategy.</description>

      <title>Smoother-type a posteriori error estimates for finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops user-friendly a posteriori error estimates of finite element methods, based on smoothers of linear iterative solvers. The proposed method employs simple smoothers, such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iteration, on an auxiliary finer mesh to process the finite element residual for a posteriori error control. The implementation has linear complexity and requires only a coarse-to-fine prolongation operator. For symmetric problems, we prove the reliability and efficiency of smoother-type error estimators under a saturation assumption. Numerical experiments for various PDEs demonstrate that the proposed smoother-type error estimators outperform residual-type estimators in accuracy and exhibit robustness with respect to parameters and polynomial degrees.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for Interior Penalty D.G. Methods for the Nonlinear Dynamics of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex Landau equation, a reaction diffusion system with applications in nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics. The equation's nonlinear imaginary component introduces rich dynamics and significant computational challenges. We address these challenges using Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. A rigorous stability analysis and a comparative study are performed on three distinct DG schemes : Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG), Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG), and Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG). These methods are compared in terms of their stability and computational efficiency. Our numerical analysis and computational results demonstrate that all three discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are stable. However, the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme proves to be the most robust, as its norm remains bounded even in the presence of nonlinear terms a property not shared by the others. A comparison between the Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG) and Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG) schemes shows that IIPG has superior stability properties. For high values of the penalty parameter, all methods exhibit similar stability behavior. Our results highlight the suitability of DG methods for simulating complex nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems and provide a practical framework for selecting the most efficient scheme for a given problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN): a scalable and reliable Bayesian model for large-scale physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks and machine learning models for uncertainty quantification suffer from limited scalability and poor reliability compared to their deterministic counterparts. In industry-scale active learning settings, where generating a single high-fidelity simulation may require days or weeks of computation and produce data volumes on the order of gigabytes, they quickly become impractical. This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that B-INNs can be from 20 times to 10,000 times faster with a robust uncertainty estimation compared to Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes. These capabilities make B-INN a practical foundation for uncertainty-driven active learning in large-scale industrial simulations, where computational efficiency and robust uncertainty calibration are paramount.</description>

      <title>Do physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) need to be deep? Shallow PINNs using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of shallow physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By reformulating PINNs as nonlinear systems, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the network parameters. Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\"odinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers. These findings indicate that, for a wide class of PDEs, shallow PINNs combined with efficient second-order optimization methods can provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions for both forward and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Structure Preserving Schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations with Degenerate Mobility and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system utilizes a diffusive phase-field for interface tracking of multi-phase fluid flows. Recently structure preserving methods for CHNS have moved into focus to construct numerical schemes that, for example, are mass conservative or obey initial bounds of the phase-field variable. In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.
  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases. All presented methods are compared against each other in terms of bound preservation, mass conservation, and energy dissipation for different examples found in the literature, including a classical rising droplet problem.</description>

      <title>Provable Emergence of Deep Neural Collapse and Low-Rank Bias in $L^2$-Regularized Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework connecting the first property of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC1) to the emergence of implicit low-rank bias in nonlinear networks trained with $L^2$ weight decay regularization. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we derive a quantitative relation between the Total Cluster Variation (TCV) of intermediate embeddings and the numerical rank of stationary weight matrices. In particular, we establish that, at any critical point, the distance from a weight matrix to the set of rank-$K$ matrices is bounded by a constant times the TCV of earlier-layer features, scaled inversely with the weight-decay parameter. Second, we prove global optimality of DNC1 in a constrained representation-cost setting for both feedforward and residual architectures, showing that zero TCV across intermediate layers minimizes the representation cost under natural architectural constraints. Third, we establish a benign landscape property: for almost every interpolating initialization there exists a continuous, loss-decreasing path from the initialization to a globally optimal, DNC1-satisfying configuration. Our theoretical claims are validated empirically; numerical experiments confirm the predicted relations among TCV, singular-value structure, and weight decay. These results indicate that neural collapse and low-rank bias are intimately linked phenomena arising from the optimization geometry induced by weight decay.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Deep Network Trainability via Persistent Subspace Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks via backpropagation is often hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. In this work, we design architectures that mitigate these issues by analyzing and controlling the network Jacobian. We first provide a unified characterization for a class of networks with orthogonal Jacobian including known architectures and yielding new trainable designs. We then introduce the relaxed notion of persistent subspace orthogonality. This applies to a broader class of networks whose Jacobians are isometries only on a non-trivial subspace. We propose practical mechanisms to enforce this condition and empirically show that it is necessary to sufficiently preserve the gradient norms during backpropagation, enabling the training of very deep networks. We support our theory with extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>A Closed-form Solution to the Wahba Problem for Pairwise Similar Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form solution to Wahba's problem in the quaternion domain for the special case of two vector observations. Existing approaches, including Davenport's $q$-method, QUEST, Horn's method, and ESOQ algorithms, recover the optimal quaternion through the eigendecomposition of a $4\times4$ matrix or iterative numerical methods. Consequently, these methods do not reveal the analytic structure of the optimal quaternion.
  In this work, we derive an explicit analytical characterization of all quaternions that yield zero Wahba cost for the case $\ell=2$. Our approach builds on a connection between quaternion similarity, the singular Sylvester equation $aq=qb$, and quaternion square roots established in our previous work [1]. We provide (i) necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Wahba's cost function is zero and (ii) a closed-form parameterization of all such quaternions. This eliminates the need for eigenvalue computations and enables a direct algebraic understanding of the underlying geometry of Wahba's problem.</description>
