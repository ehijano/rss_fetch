      <title>Topological Laplace Transform and Decomposition of nc-Hodge Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the topological Laplace transform functor from Stokes structures of exponential type to constructible sheaves on $\mathbb C$ with vanishing cohomology. We show that it is compatible with the Fourier transform of $D$-modules, and induces an equivalence of categories.
  We give two applications of the construction.
  First, we study the Fourier transform of B-model nc-Hodge structures associated to Landau-Ginzburg models, and prove the compatibility between the $\mathbb Q$-structure and the Stokes structure from the connection.
  Second, we relate the spectral decomposition of nc-Hodge structures to the vanishing cycle decomposition after Fourier transform via choices of Gabrielov paths. This is motivated by the study of the atomic decomposition of A-model nc-Hodge structures associated to smooth projective varieties.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of derived categories of sheaves on tame stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on Olander's work on algebraic spaces, we prove Orlov's representability theorem relating fully faithful functors and Fourier--Mukai transforms between the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves to the case of smooth, proper, and tame algebraic stacks. This extends previous results of Kawamata for Deligne--Mumford stacks with generically trivial stabilizers and projective coarse moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Brauer Classes of K3-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element in the Brauer group of a general complex projective $K3$ surface $S$ defines a sublattice of the transcendental lattice of $S$. We consider those elements of prime order for which this sublattice is Hodge-isometric to the transcendental lattice of another K3 surface $X$. We recall that this defines a finite map between moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces and we compute its degree. We show how the Picard lattice of $X$ determines the Picard lattice of $S$ in the case that the Picard number of $X$ is two.</description>

      <title>Galois subcovers of the Hermitian curve in characteristic $p$ with respect to subgroups of order $dp$ with $d\not=p$ prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A problem of current interest, also motivated by applications to Coding theory, is to find explicit equations for \textit{maximal} curves, that are projective, geometrically irreducible, non-singular curves defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ whose number of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational points attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound of $q^2+2\mathfrak{g}q+1$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the genus of the curve $\mathcal{X}$. For curves which are Galois covered of the Hermitian curve, this has been done so far ad hoc, in particular in the cases where the Galois group has prime order and also when has order the square of the characteristic. In this paper we obtain explicit equations of all Galois covers of the Hermitian curve with Galois group of order $dp$ where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and $d$ is prime other than $p$. We also compute the generators of the Weierstrass semigroup at a special $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational point of some of the curves, and discuss some possible positive impacts on the minimum distance problems of AG-codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jukes-Cantor model is one of the most meaningful statistical models from a biological perspective. We are interested in computing the algebraic degrees for phylogenetic varieties, which we call phylogenetic degrees, associated to the Jukes-Cantor model and any tree. As these varieties are toric, their geometry is hidden in the associated polytopes. For this reason, we provide two different combinatorial approaches to compute the volume for these polytopes.</description>

      <title>Motivic classes of curvilinear Hilbert schemes and Igusa zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the study of curvilinear Hilbert schemes associated with a singular variety $(X,0)$ and the relationship between their motivic classes and the motivic measure on the arc scheme $X_\infty$ of $X$ introduced by Denef and Loeser. We introduce an Igusa zeta function specifically tailored for curvilinear Hilbert schemes for which we provide an explicit formulation in terms of an embedded resolution of the singularity, and we consequently obtain a recursive formula to compute the motivic classes of curvilinear Hilbert schemes in terms of the resolution. In addition, the paper explores and analyzes the geometry and combinatorics of curvilinear Hilbert schemes in the context of plane curve singularities and their topological invariants.</description>

      <title>On the Serre conjecture for Artin characters in the geometric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $A$ be a regular local ring on which $G$ acts. Under certain assumptions on $A$ and the action, Serre defined a function $a_G\colon G\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ which can be viewed as a higher dimensional analogue of Artin character, and conjectured that it is associated to a $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-rational representation of $G$ for any prime $\ell$ invertible in $A$. We prove this conjecture in the equal characteristic case.</description>

Abstract: We prove Manin's conjecture for split smooth quintic del Pezzo surfaces over arbitrary number fields with respect to fairly general anticanonical height functions. After passing to universal torsors, we first show that we may restrict the torsor variables to their typical sizes, and then we can solve the counting problem in the framework of o-minimal structures.</description>

Abstract: We establish several foundational results regarding the Grothendieck-Springer affine fibration. More precisely, we prove some constructibility results on the affine Grothendieck-Springer sheaf and its coinvariants, enrich it with a group of symmetries, analog to the situation of Hitchin fibration, prove some perversity statements once we take some derived coinvariants and construct some specialization morphisms for the homology of affine Springer fibers. Along the way, we prove some homotopy result on l-adic complexes that can also be applied to Hitchin fibration.</description>

      <title>A bi-variant algebraic cobordism via correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bi-variant theory $\mathbb B(X,Y)$ defined for a pair $(X,Y)$ is a theory satisfying properties similar to those of Fulton--MacPherson's bivariant theory $\mathbb B(X \xrightarrow f Y)$ defined for a morphism $f:X \to Y$. In this paper, using correspondences we construct a bi-variant algebraic cobordism $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, Y)$ such that $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, pt)$ is isomorphic to Lee--Pandharipande's algebraic cobordism of vector bundles $\Omega_{-*,\sharp}(X)$. In particular, $\Omega^{*}(X, pt)=\Omega^{*, 0}(X, pt)$ is isomorphic to Levine--Morel's algebraic cobordism $\Omega_{-*}(X)$. Namely, $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, Y)$ is \emph{a bi-variant vesion} of Lee--Pandharipande's algebraic cobordism of bundles $\Omega_{*,\sharp}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Twisted local wild mapping class groups: configuration spaces, fission trees and complex braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12695v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the completion of the algebraic construction of the Poisson wild character varieties (B.--Yamakawa, 2015) one can consider their natural deformations, generalising both the mapping class group actions on the usual (tame) character varieties, and the G-braid groups already known to occur in the wild/irregular setting. Here we study these wild mapping class groups in the case of arbitrary formal structure in type A. As we will recall, this story is most naturally phrased in terms of admissible deformations of wild Riemann surfaces. The main results are: 1) the construction of configuration spaces containing all possible local deformations, 2) the definition of a combinatorial object, the ``fission forest'', of any wild Riemann surface and a proof that it gives a sharp parameterisation of all the admissible deformation classes. As an application of 1), by considering basic examples, we show that the braid groups of all the complex reflection groups known as the generalised symmetric groups appear as wild mapping class groups. As an application of 2), we compute the dimensions of all the (global) moduli spaces of type A wild Riemann surfaces (in fixed admissible deformation classes), a generalisation of the famous ``Riemann's count'' of the dimensions of the moduli spaces of compact Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a covariant functor W. Fulton and R. MacPherson defined \emph{an operational bivariant theory} associated to this covariant functor. In this paper we will show that given a contravariant functor one can similarly construct a ``dual" version of an operational bivariant theory, which we call a \emph{co-operational} bivariant theory. If a given contravariant functor is the usual cohomology theory, then our co-operational bivariant group for the identity map consists of what are usually called ``cohomology operations". In this sense, our co-operational bivariant theory consists of \emph{``generalized"} cohomology operations.</description>

Abstract: We show that Walcher's disk potential for the quintic threefold can be represented as a central charge of a specific Gauged Linear Sigma Model which we call the extended quintic GLSM. This representation provides an open/closed correspondence for the quintic threefold since the central charge is a generating function of closed genus-zero GLSM invariants. We also explain how open Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and open mirror symmetry for the quintic are compatible with wall-crossing and mirror symmetry of the extended GLSM, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We give necessary conditions for a category fibred in pseudo-abelian additive categories over the classifying topos of a profinite group to be a stack; these conditions are sufficient when the coefficients are $\mathbf{Q}$-linear. This applies to pure motives over a field in the sense of Grothendieck, Deligne-Milne and Andr\'e, to mixed motives in the sense of Nori and to several motivic categories considered in arXiv:1506.08386 [math.AG]. We also give a simple proof of the exactness of a sequence of motivic Galois groups under a Galois extension of the base field, which applies to all the above (Tannakian) situations. Finally, we clarify the construction of the categories of Chow-Lefschetz motives given in arXiv:2302.08327 [math.AG] and simplify the computation of their motivic Galois group in the numerical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separation bounds are a fundamental measure of the complexity of solving a zero-dimensional system as it measures how difficult it is to separate its zeroes. In the positive dimensional case, the notion of reach takes its place. In this paper, we provide bounds on the reach of a smooth algebraic variety in terms of several invariants of interest: the condition number, Smale's $\gamma$ and the bit-size. We also provide probabilistic bounds for random algebraic varieties under some general assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds satisfy several nice Hodge-theoretic properties such as the Hodge symmetry, the Hard Lefschetz property and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, etc. In this note, we investigate when such nice properties hold on compact complex manifolds with semistable degenerations. For compact complex manifolds which can be obtained as smoothings of SNC varieties without triple intersection locus, we show the Hodge symmetry when the monodromy logarithm induces isomorphisms on the associated graded. We also show the Hodge-Riemann relations on H^3 of compact complex 3-folds with such semistable degenerations under some conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that any finite extension of function fields of genus greater than 1 whose relative class group is trivial is Galois and cyclic. This depends on a result from a preceding paper which establishes a finite list of possible Weil polynomials for both fields. Given this list, we analyze most cases by computing options for the splittings of low-degree places in the extension, then consider the effect of these options on the Weil polynomials of certain isogeny factors of the Jacobian of the Galois closure. In one case, we use instead an analysis based on principal polarizations, modeled on an argument of Howe.</description>

      <title>Braid variety cluster structures, I: 3D plabic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $3$-dimensional generalizations of Postnikov's plabic graphs and use them to establish cluster structures for type $A$ braid varieties. Our results include known cluster structures on open positroid varieties and double Bruhat cells, and establish new cluster structures for type $A$ open Richardson varieties.</description>

      <title>Topological-Holomorphic ${\mathcal N} =4$ Gauge Theory: From Langlands Duality of Holomorphic Invariants to Mirror Symmetry of Quasi-topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a topological-holomorphic twist of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory on a four-manifold of the form $M_4=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2$ with Riemann surfaces $\Sigma_{1,2}$, and unravel the mathematical implications of its physics. In particular, we consider different linear combinations of the resulting scalar supercharges under $S$-duality, where this will allow us to derive novel topological and holomorphic invariants of $M_4$ and their Langlands duals. As the twisted theory can be topological along $\Sigma_1$ whence we can dimensionally reduce it to 2d, via the effective sigma-model on $\Sigma_2$, we can also relate these 4d invariants and their Langlands duals to the mirror symmetry of Higgs bundles and that of quasi-topological strings described by the sheaf of chiral differential operators. As an offshoot, we would be able to obtain a fundamental understanding from 4d gauge theory, why chiral differential operators are purely perturbative objects.</description>

      <title>A new approach to formal moduli problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for infinitesimal deformation problems, using new methods coming from operadic calculus. We construct an adjunction between infinitesimal deformation problems over some type of algebras and their Koszul dual algebras, in any characteristic. This adjunction is an equivalence if and only if some algebras are equivalent to their completions. We give a concrete homological criterion for it. It gives us a new proof of the celebrated Lurie--Pridham theorem, as well as of many other generalizations of it. Our methods are effective, meaning they directly produce point-set models for the algebras that encode infinitesimal deformation problems.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Zariski Dense Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field, and let $f:X\to{X}$ be a morphism defined over $K$. We formulate a number of statements of varying strengths asserting, roughly, that if there is at least one point $P_0\in{X(K)}$ whose $f$-orbit $\mathcal{O}_f(P_0):=\bigl\{f^n(P):n\in\mathbb{N}\bigr\}$ is Zariski dense, then there are many such points. For example, a weak conclusion would be that $X(K)$ is not the union of finitely many (grand) $f$-orbits, while a strong conclusion would be that any set of representatives for the Zariski dense grand $f$-orbits is Zariski dense. We prove statements of this sort for various classes of varieties and maps, including projective spaces, abelian varieties, and surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric $L$-functions in average polynomial time, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $e$, we describe an algorithm for computing, for all primes $p \leq X$, the mod-$p^e$ reduction of the trace of Frobenius at $p$ of a fixed hypergeometric motive over $\mathbb{Q}$ in time quasilinear in $X$. This extends our previous work for the mod-$p$ reduction, again combining the Beukers--Cohen--Mellit trace formula with average polynomial time techniques of Harvey and Harvey--Sutherland; the key new ingredient is an expanded version of Harvey's "generic prime" construction, making it possible to incorporate certain $p$-adic transcendental functions into the computation. One of these is the $p$-adic Gamma function, whose average polynomial time computation is an intermediate step which may be of independent interest. We also provide an implementation in Sage and discuss the remaining computational issues around computing hypergeometric $L$-series.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds and its novel Atiyah-Floer correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures of Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>Certified homotopy tracking using the Krawczyk method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of certifying the correctness of approximate solution paths computed by numerical homotopy continuation methods. We propose a conceptually simple approach based on a parametric variant of the Krawczyk method from interval arithmetic. Unlike most previous methods for certified path-tracking, our approach is applicable in the general setting of parameter homotopies commonly used to solve polynomial systems of equations. We also describe a novel preconditioning strategy and give theoretical correctness and termination results. Experiments using a preliminary implementation of the method indicate that our approach is competitive with specialized methods appearing previously in the literature, in spite of our more general setting.</description>

      <title>$Z$-critical equations for holomorphic vector bundles on K\"ahler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>
