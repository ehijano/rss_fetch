      <title>Time-resolved and three-dimensional elucidation of the complex refractive index alteration induced by ultrashort laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulse lasers (USPLs) have attracted attention as tools capable of inducing unique phenomena by instantaneously generating regions with transiently modified properties (filaments) in the material. However, a comprehensive understanding of USPL-induced filaments remains elusive due to the complexity of their dynamics and insufficient imaging techniques to accurately capture them. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to measure the transient complex refractive index of filaments through polarization analysis of a probe pulse. To our knowledge, this approach achieves, for the first time, accurate three dimensional mapping of the ultrafast fluctuations in complex refractive index. The present findings provide critical insights into the ablation mechanisms driven by USPLs, essential for optimizing laser parameters in micro- and nanoprocessing. Moreover, this work contributes valuable experimental data to condensed matter and computational physics by elucidating the physical properties of USPL-irradiated regions.</description>

      <title>Simplified Aluminum Nitride Processing for Low-Loss Integrated Photonics and Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum nitride (AlN) is an extremely promising material for integrated photonics because of the combination of strong \c{hi}2 and \c{hi}3 nonlinearities. However, the intrinsic hardness of the material and charging effects during electron beam lithography make AlN nanofabrication a challenging process. Conventional approaches often require multiple hard masks and a metal mask to fabricate nanostructures. In this letter, we report a novel, simple method to fabricate AlN microresonators by using a single layer of silicon nitride mask combined with a thin conductive polymer layer. The conductive layer can be conveniently removed during developing without requiring an additional etching step. We achieve high intrinsic quality (Q) factors up to one million in AlN microresonators and demonstrate several nonlinear phenomena within our devices, including frequency comb generation, Raman lasing, third harmonic generation and supercontinuum generation.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Signal Photonic SRAM-based High-Speed Energy-Efficient Photonic Tensor Core with Novel Electro-Optic ADC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid surge in data generated by Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) applications demands ultra-fast, scalable, and energy-efficient hardware, as traditional von Neumann architectures face significant latency and power challenges due to data transfer bottlenecks between memory and processing units. Furthermore, conventional electrical memory technologies are increasingly constrained by rising bitline and wordline capacitance, as well as the resistance of compact and long interconnects, as technology scales. In contrast, photonics-based in-memory computing systems offer substantial speed and energy improvements over traditional transistor-based systems, owing to their ultra-fast operating frequencies, low crosstalk, and high data bandwidth. Hence, we present a novel differential photonic SRAM (pSRAM) bitcell-augmented scalable mixed-signal multi-bit photonic tensor core, enabling high-speed, energy-efficient matrix multiplication operations using fabrication-friendly integrated photonic components. Additionally, we propose a novel 1-hot encoding electro-optic analog-to-digital converter (eoADC) architecture to convert the multiplication outputs into digital bitstreams, supporting processing in the electrical domain. Our designed photonic tensor core, utilizing GlobalFoundries' monolithic 45SPCLO technology node, achieves computation speeds of 4.10 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and a power efficiency of 3.02 TOPS/W.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluorescence from perovskite superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF), a many-body quantum optics phenomenon, emerges from the collective interactions among self-organized and cooperatively coupled emitters, producing intense burst of ultrashort coherent radiation1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-9, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized (CP) chiral SF has not been realized. Here, we report room-temperature chiral CP-SF originating from edge states in large-area (&gt;100 um * 100 um), transferable vertically aligned chiral quasi-2D perovskite superlattices. Theoretical quantum optics calculations reveal that chirality-induced photon transport drives the transition from initially incoherent, weakly polarized spontaneous emission to highly polarized CP-SF, amplifying the circular polarization degree up to around 14%. Notably, the polarization helicity is found to flip between forward and backward propagation directions, a characteristic signature of a macroscopic CP dipole transition. Moreover, both the intensity and polarization degree of CP-SF can be tuned under weak magnetic fields, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of chirality in establishing large-scale quantum coherence within chiral superlattices, thereby unveiling promising avenues for chirality-controlled quantum spin-optical applications 10,11.</description>

      <title>Fourier modal method and coordinate transformation method under nonclassical electromagnetic boundary condition for the electromagnetism of mesoscale metallic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical response of mesoscale metallic nanostructures (MMNSs) with feature sizes down to extreme nanometer scales is largely affected by the nonclassical quantum effects, which can be comprehensively described by the nonclassical electromagnetic boundary condition (NEBC) incorporating surface-response Feibelman d-parameters. Here we report the Fourier modal method (FMM) and the coordinate transformation method (C method) under the NEBC, which are built up by incorporating the NEBC into a recently reported 3D-C method [Opt. Express 29, 1516 (2021)] that is applicable to the general three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures with curved boundaries. The validity and accuracy of the proposed method are confirmed numerically through a comparison with other full-wave method incorporating the NEBC. The present work marries the NEBC and the well-developed modal methods of FMM and C method, thus bringing the advantages of these modal methods in physical intuitiveness and computational efficiency to the electromagnetic modeling of nonclassical quantum effects in the MMNSs.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition induced by twisting unit cells in photonic Lieb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics was embarked from realizing the first-order chiral edge state in gyromagnetic media, but its higher-order states were mostly studied in dielectric lattice instead. In this paper in a series of gyromagnetic Lieb photonic crystals, we theoretically unveil topological phases which include the first-order Chern, and the second-order dipole, quadrupole phases. Concretely, for the primitive Lieb lattice, and for its deformation by breaking spatial symmetry through unit-cell twisting, versatile topological phases can be established to transit around, with bandgap closures marking the phase boundaries. Our results may contribute to broadening the scope of design schemes for topological phase manipulation, potentially enabling multifunctional photonic devices for information communication.</description>

      <title>Sub-Ensemble Isolation in SERF Magnetometry Enabled by Micrometer-Scale Polarization Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional understanding of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) atom ensemble pertains to the common perception that the rapid exchange of atom state finally results in uniform time evolution of the whole ensemble. However, in this study, we demonstrate that by manipulation of pumping polarization in micro-meter level, misalignment between the time evolution of different sub-ensemble can be created within single SERF ensemble with unprecedent independency. A novel pumping system consists of a miniaturized $^{87}$Rb vapor cell and a space-variant polarization metasurface is developed for the prove of concept. Our method induces position-dependent atomic anisotropy in both pumping and absorption into the thermal atomic ensemble. By constructing calculated Zeeman-sublevel populations in SERF regime, distinct sensing channels are generated with 0.22 $V\ nT^{-1}$ average scale factor, which is comparable with single channel generated by single SERF ensemble. Average crosstalk ratio between adjacent channels (between micron scale sub-ensembles) are measured up to 32 dB, through the excitation of fictitious magnetic field (3.5 nT, 30 Hz), which is measured as 20 dB without sub-ensemble isolation in same experimental condition. Our work demonstrates unprecedented spatial resolution in SERF magnetometry which hold new promises for applications including high-spatial resolution neural biomagnetism mapping and portable magnetism measurement device.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Optical Misalignment Diagnostics in Multi-Lens Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes, highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements. First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.</description>

      <title>3D surface profiling via photonic integrated geometric sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of microscale surface patterns are essential for process and quality control in industries across semiconductors, micro-machining, and biomedicines. However, the development of miniaturized and intelligent profiling systems remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the complexity and bulkiness of existing benchtop systems required to scan large-area samples. A real-time, in-situ, and fast detection alternative is therefore highly desirable for predicting surface topography on the fly. In this paper, we present an ultracompact geometric profiler based on photonic integrated circuits, which directly encodes the optical reflectance of the sample and decodes it with a neural network. This platform is free of complex interferometric configurations and avoids time-consuming nonlinear fitting algorithms. We show that a silicon programmable circuit can generate pseudo-random kernels to project input data into higher dimensions, enabling efficient feature extraction via a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Our device is capable of high-fidelity, fast-scanning-rate thickness identification for both smoothly varying samples and intricate 3D printed emblem structures, paving the way for a new class of compact geometric sensors.</description>

      <title>Photonic Altermagnets: Magnetic Symmetries in Photonic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique physical properties of altermagnets, when transplanted to photonic systems, are anticipated to offer a new degree of freedom for engineering electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that a photonic analogue of altermagnetism can be mimicked in photonic crystals, where engineered photonic crystals can host spin space group symmetries. Our approach allows for the creation of spin-split bands and the corresponding transport properties provide an effective platform for circularly polarized light isolation without the need of geometrodynamic spin-orbit interaction. Beyond the concurrent solid-state materials, we anticipate our work to offer photonic crystals as a versatile platform to test the spin-split band properties and inspire optical designs for photospintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering Magnetization with Photons: Nanoscale Advances in the Inverse Faraday Effect for Metallic and Plasmonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse Faraday effect, the ability of light to act as a source of magnetism, is a cornerstone of modern ultrafast optics. Harnessing this effect at the nanoscale promises to transform data storage and spintronics, yet its predictive understanding remains elusive. This review synthesizes recent progress in engineering the IFE within plasmonic architectures. We bridge the theoretical foundations, from classical drift current models to quantum descriptions, with the latest experimental milestones, including pump probe studies that have verified the effect s subpicosecond nature. Special emphasis is placed on how nanostructure design allows for unprecedented control, enabling functionalities like chiral or reversed magnetization by locally sculpting the optical spin density. Despite this progress, a crucial challenge pervades the field, a stark, often orders of magnitude, mismatch between predicted and measured magnetization values. We contend that resolving this discrepancy is paramount. The path forward requires the development of novel experimental probes capable of directly imaging these fleeting magnetic fields at their native length and time scales, ultimately unlocking the true potential of nanoscale optical magnetism.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal thermalization and adiabatic cooling of guided light waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically characterize three-dimensional spatio-temporal thermalization of a continuous-wave classical light beam propagating along a multi-mode optical waveguide. By combining a non-equilibrium kinetic approach based on the wave turbulence theory and numerical simulations of the field equations, we anticipate that thermalizing scattering events are dramatically accelerated by the combination of strong transverse confinement with the continuous nature of the temporal degrees of freedom. In connection with the blackbody catastrophe, the thermalization of the classical field in the continuous temporal direction provides an intrinsic mechanism for adiabatic cooling and, then, spatial beam condensation. Our results open new avenues in the direction of a simultaneous spatial and temporal beam cleaning.</description>

      <title>Nanoplasmonic Optical Fiber Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Using an Aptamer-DNA Tetrahedron Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fiber sensing carries a number of potential advantages for diagnostics and biomarker detection and monitoring, yet particular challenges persist in linking molecular recognition events to a change in the refractive index. DNA aptamers carry particular advantages as functional surface molecules on optical fibers to tailor detection of specific biomolecules, yet challenges persist around sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis of COVID-19 through detection of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV-2 provides a classic diagnostic challenge where optical fiber-based sensing could complement and improve on typical detection methods such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing. In this study, a plasmonic gold-coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG)-based optical biosensing platform was developed for ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. By functionalizing the optical fiber surface with aptamers for the molecular recognition of N protein, changes in refractive index measured biomolecular binding, thereby achieving real-time, label-free detection. Additionally, integrating DNA nanostructures such as the DNA tetrahedron with aptamers significantly enhanced detection sensitivity, increasing signal intensity ~2.5 times compared to aptamers alone. This study provides new insights into the development of high-performance optical fiber sensing platforms which integrate DNA nanostructure interfaces to facilitate biomarker recognition and sensing.</description>

      <title>Integrated bright source of polarization-entangled photons using lithium niobate photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photonics has rapidly advanced as a key area for developing quantum technologies by harnessing photons' inherent quantum characteristics, particularly entanglement. Generation of entangled photon pairs, known as Bell states, is crucial for quantum communications, precision sensing, and quantum computing. While bulk quantum optical setups have provided foundational progress, integrated quantum photonic platforms now offer superior scalability, efficiency, and integrative potential. In this study, we demonstrate a compact and bright source of polarization-entangled Bell state utilizing continuous-wave pumping on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics. Our periodically poled lithium niobate device achieves on-chip brightness of photon pair generation rate of 508.5 MHz/mW, surpassing other integrated platforms including silicon photonics. This demonstration marks the first realization of polarization entanglement on TFLN platforms. Experimentally measured metrics confirm high-quality entangled photon pairs with a purity of 0.901, a concurrence of 0.9, and a fidelity of 0.944. We expect our compact quantum devices to have great potential for advancing quantum communication systems and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces offer unique properties unattainable with periodic or ordered metasurfaces, notably the absence of deterministic interference effects at specific wavelengths and angles. In this work, we introduce a lithography-free nanofabrication approach to realize cascaded disordered plasmonic metasurfaces with sub-micron total thickness. We experimentally characterize their angle-resolved specular and diffuse reflections using the bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) and develop accurate theoretical models that remain valid even at large incidence angles. These models reveal the intricate interplay between coherent (specular) and incoherent (diffuse) scattering and demonstrate how coherent illumination can strongly influence the perceived color of diffusely scattered light. Exploiting this effect, we realize a centimeter-scale chromo-encryption device whose color changes depending on whether it is viewed under direct or diffuse illumination. Our results lay the groundwork for advanced nanophotonic platforms based on stacked disordered metasurfaces, offering versatile optical functionalities inaccessible with traditional multilayer thin-film technologies or single-layer metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Bistable quartic soliton in saturable nonlinear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of novel bistable quartic soliton (BQS) in saturable nonlinear media. We propose a realistic dispersion-engineered ridge waveguide based
  on Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) that offers a suitable environment to excite the family of BQS. Adopting the variational method we analytically establish the amplitude-width relation which reveals that stable QSs with identical duration but two different amplitudes can coexist. We further investigate the robustness of such BQS under perturbation by performing the linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Brightening interlayer excitons by electric-field-driven hole transfer in bilayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe the interlayer A1s^I, A2s^I, and B1s^I excitons in bilayer WSe2 under applied electric fields using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Remarkably, these interlayer excitons remain optically bright despite being well separated from symmetry-matched intralayer excitons-a regime where conventional two-level coupling models fail unless unphysically large coupling strengths are assumed. To uncover the origin of this brightening, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and find that the applied electric field distorts the valence-band Bloch states, driving the hole wavefunction from one layer to the other. This field-driven interlayer hole transfer imparts intralayer character to the interlayer excitons, thereby enhancing their oscillator strength without requiring hybridization with bright intralayer states. Simulations confirm that this mechanism accounts for the major contribution to the observed brightness, with excitonic hybridization playing only a minor role. Our results identify interlayer hole transfer as a robust and general mechanism for brightening interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially when inter- and intralayer excitons are energetically well separated.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Band Theory for 2D Geometry-Dependent Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, represents the key feature of the non-Hermitian lattice systems. Although the non-Bloch band theory has achieved success in depicting the NHSE in one-dimensional (1D) systems, its extension to higher dimensions encounters a fundamental hurdle in the form of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates rely on the lattice geometry. In this work, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by introducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework. Through taking two sequential 1D thermodynamic limits, first along a major axis and then along a minor axis, we construct geometry-dependent non-Bloch bands, unraveling that the GDSE originates from the competition between incompatible SGBZs. Based on our theory, we derive for the first time a crucial sufficient condition for the GDSE: the non-Bloch dynamical degeneracy splitting of SGBZ eigenstates, where a continuous set of degenerate complex momenta breaks down into a discrete set. Moreover, our SGBZ formulation reveals that the Amoeba spectrum contains the union of all possible SGBZ spectra, which bridges the gap between the GDSE and the Amoeba theory. The proposed SGBZ framework offers a universal roadmap for exploring non-Hermitian effects in 2D lattice systems, opening up new avenues for the design of novel non-Hermitian materials and devices with tailored boundary behaviors.</description>

      <title>Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Multi-plateau high-harmonic generation in liquids driven by off-site recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative high-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently been observed in the liquid phase, where it was demonstrated to have a different physical mechanism compared to gas and solid phases of matter. The currently best physical picture for liquid HHG eliminates scattered-electron contributions and identifies on-site recombination as the dominant contributor. This mechanism accurately predicts the cut-off energy and its independence of the driving laser wavelength and intensity. However, this implies that additional energy absorbed in the liquid as the driving laser intensity is increased does not result in higher-order non-linearities, which is in contrast to the conventional expectation from most nonlinear media. Here we experimentally observe the formation of a second plateau in HHG from multiple liquids (water, heavy water, propranol, and ethanol), thus explaining the conundrum of the missing higher-order response. We analyze this second plateau with a combination of experimental, state-of-the-art ab-initio numerical (in diverse systems of water, ammonia, and liquid methane), and semi-classical analytical, techniques, and elucidate its physical origin to electrons that recombine on neighboring water molecules rather than at the ionization site, leading to unique HHG ellipticity dependence. Remarkably, we find that the second plateau is dominated by electrons recombining at the second solvation shell, relying on wide hole delocalization. Theory also predicts the appearance of even higher plateaus, indicating a general trend. Our work establishes new physical phenomena in the highly non-linear optical response of liquids, paving the way to attosecond probing of electron dynamics in solutions.</description>

      <title>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. This work proposes an optical absorption-based model to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material and calculates the instantaneous optical absorption from the polarization current density associated with this dispersion model. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based approach in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The method is further validated against experimental results via simulations of a photoconductive device, where the Poynting vector-based approach results in divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong.</description>

Abstract: The research on sensing the sensitivity of the light field in the whispering gallery mode (WGM) to the micro-cavity environment has already appeared, which uses the frequency shift of the light field in the WGM or the sensitivity of the resonance peak frequency shift. Multi-mode comb teeth of optical frequency comb(OFC) generated by nonlinear micro-cavity have excellent sensitivity to micro-cavity environment, and they have more sensitivity degrees of freedom compared with WGM light field (the strength of each comb tooth can be influenced by micro-cavity environment). The influence of different substances on the environmental parameters of micro-cavity is complex and nonlinear, so we use machine learning method to automatically extract the spectrum characteristics, the average accuracy of single-parameter identification attains to 99.5%, and the average accuracy of double parameter identification attains to 97.0%. Based on the integration of micro-cavity OFC and wave-guide coupling structure, we propose an set of fluid characteristics detection integrated device in theoretically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging arrays have demonstrated great potential in applications spanning from military to civilian consumer electronics. However, the current focal plane arrays (FPAs), which are based on compound semiconductors, have limited applications in civilian circumstances due to elevated manufacturing costs and prolonged fabrication cycle time. To address this, a high-performance 320 $\times$ 256 focal plane array based on group-IV semiconductors has been designed and manufactured on a Si substrate using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible fabrication process. The optical absorption layer is composed of GeSn alloy, whose bandgap could be tailored by choosing the appropriate Sn concentration. In this work, a 10% Sn concentration was employed, yielding a response cutoff wavelength of 2308 nm for the Si-based photodetector, which was measured at 298 K. Moreover, a specific detectivity of 9.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$\cdot$ Hz$^{1/2}$ $\cdot$ W$^{-1}$ has been achieved at 77 K, surpassing all previously reported GeSn devices, and rivals commercial extended InGaAs photodetectors. With the help of read-out circuits (ROIC), SWIR images have been successfully captured for the first time by using Si-based GeSn FPA. This work demonstrates the potential of group IV imaging arrays for various applications in the commercial SWIR imaging field.</description>

      <title>Frequency-shifted laser feedback interferometry in non-planar ring oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser feedback interferometry (LFI) has a wide range of applications such as displacement, distance and velocity measurements. LFI has been realized in many types of lasers but has never been reported in non-planar ring oscillators (NPRO) to the best of our knowledge. Here, we present a new type of LFI based on an NPRO laser. The intrinsic resistance to optical feedback in NPROs is broken under weak magnetic intensity condition, where stable bidirectional lasing is initiated in the ring cavity. The interference signal, i.e., the beat of the bidirectional lasing is with frequency in the range of a few hundred kilohertz, which is mainly determined by the applied magnetic intensity in NPRO. Frequency shifted LFI is thus constructed in NPRO without using acoustic optic modulators as mostly used in conventional LFI. A theoretical model based on two frequency rate equations and Lang-Kobayashi equation is presented to describe the mechanism of LFI in NPRO. In the end, micro-vibrational measurements are demonstrated to prove the potential application, where vibration-detection amplitude limit is sub-picometer, and the detection frequency range from kilohertz to a few hundred kilohertz is achieved. Benefiting from the characteristics of tiny footprint, ruggedized structure, long lifetime and ultralow-noise of NPRO lasers, NPRO-based LFI may find important applications in industry, scientific research,military and aerospace.</description>

Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-embedded convolutional neural network (P-CNN) that embeds spectro-temporal correlations can circumvent such challenges, resulting in faster convergence and reduced noise sensitivity. This innovative approach enables on-demand control over spectro-temporal features of SC, achieving few-cycle pulse shaping without external compressors. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal light state engineering, with implications for ultrafast photonics, photonic neuromorphic computation, and AI-driven optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive detection of objects embedded inside an optically scattering medium is essential for numerous applications in engineering and sciences. However, in most applications light at visible or near-infrared wavebands is scattered by the medium resulting in the obscuration of the embedded objects. Existing methods to overcome scattering generally rely on point-by-point scanning strategies, which limit spatial sampling density. In this work, we address the sampling limitations by drawing inspiration from multisensory integration mechanisms observed in nature, wherein distinct sensing modalities work together to enhance the perception of the surroundings. Our multisensory approach leverages the unique advantages of coherent light by combining the sensitivity of an interferometric LiDAR with a wide field neuromorphic sensor to probe objects inside a densely scattering medium. The neuromorphic camera provides wide field spatial cues of the embedded object, by monitoring the fluctuations in the speckle patterns produced by tuning the laser frequency. These spatial cues are used to guide a point-scanning FMCW LiDAR to retrieve high-resolution images. Using this approach, we imaged objects embedded within an 8 cm thick (&gt;100 transport mean free paths), tissue-like scattering medium with a 10x improvement in sampling density compared to traditional uniform sampling.</description>

      <title>Wireless millimeterwave electro-optics on thin film lithium niobate</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data traffic is accelerating the need for ultra-broadband communication technologies, particularly in cloud infrastructure and emerging 6G wireless systems. Optical computing and quantum information processing also demand fast, scalable ways to interface optical and electronic signals. Integrated electro-optic modulators provide a compact and efficient solution, but extending their operation into the millimeterwave (mmWave) range with wide bandwidth and compatibility with wireless signals remains a significant challenge. Bulky electrical packaging and high mmWave losses remain primary barriers to scalability. Here, we demonstrate a wireless and wideband electro-optic modulation architecture that directly interfaces mmWaves with optical signals, eliminating the need for impedance-matched mmWave probes and cables. By integrating an on-chip antenna with a co-designed transmission line on thin-film lithium niobate platform, we achieve wideband modulation across the WR9.0 (82-125 GHz) and WR2.8 (240-380 GHz) bands. The wideband nature of our modulator enables the device to function as a high-speed detector of mmWave carriers modulated up to 6~GHz and achieves a flat and wide response, a key requirement for 6G and high-speed mmWave sensing. By configuring the antenna-coupled transmission line to operate as a cavity, our wireless platform enables triply resonant electro-optic frequency comb generation with mode spacing of 123.2 GHz and 307.9 GHz. Extracted single-photon electro-optic coupling rates of $g_{0} =2\pi\times 4.98$ kHz and $2\pi\times 9.93$ kHz, at 123.2 and 307.9 GHz, respectively, demonstrate favorable scaling with mmWave frequency. These results introduce a new class of wireless electro-optic devices for high-speed modulation, detection, and frequency comb generation, with impactful applications in communications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Intelligent configuration of integrated microwave photonic filter with programmable response and self-stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic filters (IMPFs) have emerged as promising candidates for advanced microwave systems owing to their distinctive combination of wide operational bandwidth, flexibility, and compact size. Nevertheless, the complex and time-consuming manual manipulation of IMPFs remains a significant impediment to their widespread applications. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we experimentally demonstrate the first intelligent configuration of IMPF featuring wideband center frequency tunability, flexible bandwidth reconfigurability, self-stabilization, and excellent channel equalization simultaneously. The configuration is enabled by our proposed universal hybrid collaboration strategy, which can fully unleash the hardware potential of the optical device, thus enabling comprehensive synergy of multiple properties. Results show that the center frequency of IMPF is tuned from 2 to 48 GHz, covering microwave S- to Ka-bands, and the bandwidth is reconfigured from 0.66 to 4.15 GHz, with a rejection ratio of up to 37.67 dB. The roll-off rate and shape factor reach as high as 17.50 dB/GHz and 0.78, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum center frequency drift of IMPF in 3 hours is reduced from 11.950 to 0.051 GHz even without a thermo-electric cooler, indicating that the center frequency stability is enhanced by 234 times. The passband shape of the IMPF can also be dynamically adjusted to equalize frequency-dependent fading, achieving up to 2.42 dB compensation of intra-channel fading. Our work highlights the potential of IMPFs based on intelligent configuration, unlocking new avenues for practical applications of microwave photonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color dipole trap with sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap for cesium that allows us to generate two diametral periodic one-dimensional arrays of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half the resonant free-space wavelength of the cesium D2 transition. This is achieved by launching a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We trap and optically interface the atoms in the resulting periodic optical potential and characterize the trap by measuring the lifetime of the trapped atoms, the atom-light coupling strength, the filling factor, and the trap frequencies in the radial and axial directions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects, such as selective radiance.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of laser-driven cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice with respect to the radiation wavelength, the Bragg scattering into the cavity can be suppressed by destructive interference: the atomic array is subradiant to the cavity mode under transverse illumination. We show however, that strong collective coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>

      <title>Pixel super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient mechanism of laser pulse focusing with the help of shaped underdense plasma target immersed in inhomogeneous magnetic field has been demonstrated. These studies have been carried out with the help of 2-D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation employing the OSIRIS 4.0 platform. It is shown that the divergent magnetic field profile compresses the EM wave pulse in the transverse direction. A comparative investigation with plane and lens shaped plasma geometries has also been conducted to find an optimal configuration for focusing the laser at the desirable location. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that when the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) layer is placed at a suitable location where the laser is focused, a highly energetic electron beam gets generated.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>InGaN Nanopixel Arrays on Single Crystal GaN Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Furthermore, CuInP$_2$S$_6$ exhibits a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of any known material in this wavelength regime. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>
