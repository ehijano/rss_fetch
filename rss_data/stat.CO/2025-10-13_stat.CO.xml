      <title>Bayesian Model Inference using Bayesian Quadrature: the Art of Acquisition Functions and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating posteriors and the associated model evidences is a core issue of Bayesian model inference, and can be of great challenge given complex features of the posteriors such as multi-modalities of unequal importance, nonlinear dependencies and high sharpness. Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) has emerged as a competitive framework for tackling this challenge, as it provides flexible balance between computational cost and accuracy. The performance of a BQ scheme is fundamentally dictated by the acquisition function as it exclusively governs the generation of integration points. After reexamining one of the most advanced acquisition function from a prospective inference perspective and reformulating the quadrature rules for prediction, four new acquisition functions, inspired by distinct intuitions on expected rewards, are primarily developed, all of which are accompanied by elegant interpretations and highly efficient numerical estimators. Mathematically, these four acquisition functions measure, respectively, the prediction uncertainty of posterior, the contribution to prediction uncertainty of evidence, as well as the expected reduction of prediction uncertainties concerning posterior and evidence, and thus provide flexibility for highly effective design of integration points. These acquisition functions are further extended to the transitional BQ scheme, along with several specific refinements, to tackle the above-mentioned challenges with high efficiency and robustness. Effectiveness of the developments is ultimately demonstrated with extensive benchmark studies and application to an engineering example.</description>

      <title>Solving Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov Equation by Distribution Self-adaptation Normalized Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems provide essential mathematical frameworks for modeling complex real-world phenomena. The Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation governs the evolution of probability density functions associated with stochastic system trajectories. Developing robust numerical methods for solving the FPK equation is critical for understanding and predicting stochastic behavior. Here, we introduce the distribution self-adaptive normalized physics-informed neural network (DSN-PINNs) for solving time-dependent FPK equations through the integration of soft normalization constraints with adaptive resampling strategies. Specifically, we employ a normalization-enhanced PINN model in a pretraining phase to establish the solution's global structure and scale, generating a reliable prior distribution. Subsequently, guided by this prior, we dynamically reallocate training points via weighted kernel density estimation, concentrating computational resources on regions most representative of the underlying probability distribution throughout the learning process. The key innovation lies in our method's ability to exploit the intrinsic structural properties of stochastic dynamics while maintaining computational accuracy and implementation simplicity. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive numerical experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods, including validation on real-world economic datasets.</description>

      <title>Uncovering All Highly Credible Binary Treatment Hierarchy Questions in Network Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing research interest in addressing treatment hierarchy questions within network meta-analysis (NMA). In NMAs involving many treatments, the number of possible hierarchy questions becomes prohibitively large. To manage this complexity, previous work has recommended pre-selecting specific hierarchy questions of interest (e.g., ``among options A, B, C, D, E, do treatments A and B have the two best effects in terms of improving outcome X?") and calculating the empirical probabilities of the answers being true given the data. In contrast, we propose an efficient and scalable algorithmic approach that eliminates the need for pre-specification by systematically generating a comprehensive catalog of highly credible treatment hierarchy questions, specifically, those with empirical probabilities exceeding a chosen threshold (e.g., 95%). This enables decision-makers to extract all meaningful insights supported by the data. An additional algorithm trims redundant insights from the output to facilitate interpretation. We define and address six broad types of binary hierarchy questions (i.e., those with true/false answers), covering standard hierarchy questions answered using existing ranking metrics - pairwise comparisons and (cumulative) ranking probabilities - as well as many other complex hierarchy questions. We have implemented our methods in an R package and illustrate their application using real NMA datasets on diabetes and depression interventions. Beyond NMA, our approach is relevant to any decision problem concerning three or more treatment options.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Multi-level Models Using the Survey-Weighted Pseudo-Posterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation and inference from complex survey samples typically focuses on global model parameters whose estimators have asymptotic properties, such as from fixed effects regression models. We present a motivating example of Bayesian inference for a multi-level or mixed effects model in which both the local parameters (e.g. group level random effects) and the global parameters may need to be adjusted for the complex sampling design. We evaluate the limitations of the survey-weighted pseudo-posterior and an existing automated post-processing method to incorporate the complex survey sample design for a wide variety of Bayesian models. We propose modifications to the automated process and demonstrate their improvements for multi-level models via a simulation study and a motivating example from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Reproduction examples are available from the authors and the updated R package is available via github:https://github.com/RyanHornby/csSampling</description>

      <title>Integrated Analysis for Electronic Health Records with Structured and Sporadic Missingness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: We propose a novel imputation method tailored for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with structured and sporadic missingness. Such missingness frequently arises in the integration of heterogeneous EHR datasets for downstream clinical applications. By addressing these gaps, our method provides a practical solution for integrated analysis, enhancing data utility and advancing the understanding of population health.
  Materials and Methods: We begin by demonstrating structured and sporadic missing mechanisms in the integrated analysis of EHR data. Following this, we introduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to handle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish theoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the integrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical performance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex missingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by validation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).
  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms existing imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS, Macomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases and provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared to benchmark methods.
  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful method for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and reliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets. The proposed approach holds significant potential for advancing research in population health.</description>
