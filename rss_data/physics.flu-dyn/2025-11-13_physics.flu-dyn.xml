      <title>Cross-Field Interface-Aware Neural Operators for Multiphase Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.</description>

      <title>Comments on the paper `Modelling and nonclassical symmetry analysis of a complex porous media flow in a dilating channel'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Comments are devoted to the recently published paper 'Modelling and nonclassical symmetry analysis of a complex porous media flow in a dilating channel' (Physica D. 481 (2025) 134834), in which a model describing an unsteady two-dimensional viscous incompressible fluid flow through a porous medium is studied. The main theoretical results of that study consists of finding Lie and nonclassical symmetries of a fourth-order PDE, which was derived by simplification of the given model. Here it is shown that the main theoretical results derived therein are incomplete and misleading.</description>

      <title>A consistent {\delta}-Plus-ULPH model towards higher accuracy and lower numerical dissipation with fewer neighboring particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel consistent {\delta}+- Updated Lagrangian Particle Hydrodynamics (ULPH) model. Although the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model has gained recognized achievements, it is afflicted by excessive numerical dissipation when the neighboring particles are insufficient. The present proposed consistent {\delta}+-ULPH model has advantages in overcoming this problem. To improve the accuracy, efficiency, stability, and energy conservation, several new techniques are introduced to the consistent {\delta}+-ULPH model. A novel extended support domain technique is proposed to achieve higher accuracy with fewer neighboring particles. An optimal matrix for the velocity divergence is proposed to improve the free-surface stability. A consistent particle shifting technique for the ULPH scheme is proposed to maintain a uniform and regular particle distribution and obtain superior conservation. In addition, an acoustic damper term for the ULPH scheme is introduced to improve the pressure field stability. Five benchmark tests were carried out to validate the consistent {\delta}+-ULPH model. The conventional ULPH and the consistent {\delta}+-SPH results are presented for comparison. Results indicate that the proposed consistent {\delta}+-ULPH model can accurately simulate both gentle waves and violent sloshing flows and shows higher accuracy and lower numerical dissipation when using fewer neighboring particles, even in long-term and long-distance wave propagation simulations. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the consistent {\delta}+-ULPH model is enhanced visibly because of fewer neighboring particles.</description>

      <title>Patient-Scale Blood Flow Analysis in Artery Stent Implantation via Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation framework for coronary stent implantation is developed, which unifies weakly compressible hemodynamics, Neo-Hookean solids, and stent-artery contacts, based on a multi-resolution particle discretization. Prior to application, feasibility and accuracy are established via three baseline validations: (i) poiseuille flow in a two-dimensional channel with prescribed parabolic inflow and a pressure outlet, maintaining parabolic profiles with low Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP); (ii) channel flow initialized with a uniform velocity field and driven by a specified inlet-outlet pressure differential, with agreement to reference profiles quantified by low RMSEP at five reference instants; and (iii) a three-ring impact benchmark in solid mechanics, capturing large deformation, multi-body contact, and self-contact. The validated framework is subsequently applied to a coronary bifurcation with a focal stenosis, where flow-field diagnostics reveal acceleration at the stenotic throat, near-wall low-velocity zones, and co-localization of elevated pressure with increased Von Mises stress at the bifurcation and inlet. Following simulated stent implantation, velocity transitions across the stenosis become smoother, pressure gradients are reduced, and the fractional flow reserve increases from 0.45 to 0.91. These results demonstrate that the proposed SPH framework yields quantitatively reliable, clinically interpretable hemodynamic metrics alongside robust solid-solid contact predictions, thereby supporting rigorous analysis and pre-procedural planning of vascular interventions.</description>

      <title>Physics-based localization methodology for Data Assimilation by Ensemble Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-based methodology for the determination of the localization function for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is proposed. The spatial features of such function evolve dynamically over time according to the relevant instantaneous flow features of the ensemble members with the objective, to reduce the computational cost of the Data Assimilation (DA) procedure when applied with solvers for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The validation of the methodology has been carried out by the analysis of two test cases exhibiting different features. This permits to investigate different physical features, tailored for each test case, which affect the localization function. The flow over a two-dimensional square cylinder at $Re=150$ is the first case investigated. It has been shown that the proposed localization procedure leads to a more cost-effective DA process by reducing the size of the assimilated regions while keeping the same level of accuracy. The capabilities of the methodology are further demonstrated by the investigation of the turbulent flow around a three-dimensional circular cylinder for $Re=3900$. Again, the methodology exhibits an excellent trade off in terms of accuracy versus computational requirements.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Boundary-Layer Height and Actuation-Parameter Effects of a Circular Synthetic Jet Actuator in Crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional unsteady numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effects of blowing ratio $C_B$ ($0.85 &lt; \overline{U}_j/U_\infty &lt; 1.7$), stroke ratio $L^+$ ($10.6 &lt; \overline{U}_j /(fd) &lt; 21.3$), and boundary-layer height ratio $D^+$ ($2.1&lt;\delta/d&lt;8.0$) on circular synthetic jet actuator (SJA) performance in crossflow. Nine cases are examined at constant free-stream velocity $U_\infty$, with systematic independent variation of averaged jet velocity $\overline{U}_j$, actuation frequency $f$ ($200$-$400~\mathrm{Hz}$), and boundary-layer momentum thickness Reynolds number ($170&lt;Re_\theta&lt;740$) to isolate the individual effects of these parameters on a circular-nozzle SJA with fixed nozzle diameter $d$ in crossflow. Instantaneous vortical structures exhibited tilted vortex rings with a trailing vortex pair at low actuation frequency; closely packed expelled vortical structures for higher frequency SJAs, and the largest boundary-layer height ratio induced hairpin-like vortices. Near-wall tertiary vortices, which promote downwash and increase wall shear stress, remain coherent longer and have extended spanwise coverage for low $D^+$. Time-averaged boundary-layer profiles and skin-friction distributions reveal that SJAs with low to moderate $D^+$ have the greatest potential for separation control, maintaining increased near-wall momentum over extended streamwise distances.</description>

      <title>Prediction of bypass transition in hypersonic blunt-plate boundary layers subject to noisy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hypersonic boundary-layer flows over blunt bodies, laminar-turbulent transition exhibits two distinct regimes: for small nose radii, increased bluntness delays transition; beyond a critical radius, further increasing bluntness reverses this trend. The latter regime corresponds to a bypass transition route, whose onset remains challenging to predict. The primary difficulty lies in capturing the excitation of non-modal streaks in the nose region, which is strongly affected by the bow shock and entropy layer effects. Recently, Zhao &amp; Dong (J. Fluid Mech., 2025, 1013: A44) develops a high-efficient, high-accuracy shock-fitting harmonic linearised Navier-Stokes (SF-HLNS) approach to quantify the excitation of linear non-modal perturbations. In this paper, we present a predictive framework for bypass transition by integrating the SF-HLNS approach with the nonlinear parabolised stability equations (NPSE) and the bi-global stability analysis (BSA). The NPSE is employed to track the nonlinear evolution of the streaky perturbations up to nonlinear saturation, while the BSA approach is used to capture the high-growth secondary instabilities. By integrating the growth rates of these secondary instability from their neutral positions, an amplitude amplification factor is obtained, enabling the prediction of transition onset. Under slow-acoustic forcing conditions drawn from wind-tunnel experiments, the present hybrid framework successfully reproduces the transition-reversal phenomenon at large nose radii, and yields quantitative agreement with measured transition locations, thereby validating its predictive capability.</description>

      <title>Effect of submerged vegetation on water surface geometry and air-water momentum transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how submerged vegetation modifies the water surface is crucial for modeling momentum exchange between shallow waters and the atmosphere. In particular, quantifying its impact on the equivalent aerodynamic roughness of the water surface is essential for improved boundary-layer parameterization in oceanic and atmospheric models. In this Letter, we present fully resolved multiphase simulations of gravity-driven flow over a fully submerged vegetated bed, capturing the coupled dynamics of air, water, and individual plant stems, under quasi-realistic conditions (the air/water viscosity ratio is real, while the density ratio is reduced tenfold). Our results show that vegetation submerged for four times its height regularizes the water surface suppressing strong deformations and homogenizing streamwise-propagating wave fronts along the transversal direction. Despite these alterations, the equivalent roughness perceived by the overlying air flow remains unchanged. These findings clarify vegetation-surface interactions and provide quantitative insights for nature-based wave mitigation strategies and atmospheric boundary-layer modeling.</description>

      <title>Active bacterial pattern formation in evaporating droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria living on surfaces are often confined to droplets. When these droplets evaporate, the motion of the liquid-air interface and the associated internal capillary flow confine the bacteria. Here we study how \emph{E. coli} bacteria interact with this capillary confinement and agglomerate at the droplet's contact line. We identify three different types of bacterial pattern formation that depend on the bacterial activity and the environmental conditions imposed by the evaporating droplet. When the evaporation is fast, the bacteria are slow or the suspension is dilute, a uniform contact-line deposit forms. However, when the capillary confinement concentrates the bacteria at the contact line beyond a critical number density, localized collective motion spontaneously emerges. In that case, the bacteria induce a local stirring of the liquid that allows them to self-organize into periodic patterns and enables them to collectively escape from the contact line. At very high number densities, these periodic patterns get destabilized by bacterial turbulence in the bulk of the droplet resulting in the formation of mobile bacterial plumes at the contact line. Our results show how the subtle interplay between the bacteria and the capillary flow inside the droplet that surrounds them governs their dispersal.</description>

      <title>Diffuse-interface modeling and simulation of the freezing of binary fluids with the Marangoni effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a diffuse-interface model for simulating gas-liquid-solid multiphase flows involving solid-liquid phase change, solute transport, and the Marangoni effect. In this model, a phase-field method is employed to capture the evolution of fluid-fluid interfaces, while an enthalpy-based approach is used to describe the temperature field and implicitly track the solid-liquid interface. Solute transport is modeled using a constrained scalar-transport model combined with a pseudo-potential concentration approach. The proposed diffuse-interface model satisfies the reduction consistency, and can degenerate to the conservative phase-field method for incompressible two-phase flow and the classical enthalpy method for binary material solidification in an appropriate way. Furthermore, the model not only can preserve the mass conservation, but also can capture the volume change induced by phase change. To solve the diffuse-interface model, a lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is then developed, and the numerical tests demonstrate that the method has a good performance in the study of the freezing process coupled with Marangoni flow, phase-change-induced volume change, and solute transport. Finally, the model is applied to investigate the freezing dynamics of a system containing an insoluble impurity, revealing the complex interaction between the advancing freezing front and the impurity. It is found that the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Optimising the 3-channel microfluidic system to investigate chemical gradient impacts on bacterial chemotaxis in fluid and near surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria can adjust their swimming behaviour in response to chemical variations, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. This process is characterised by a drift velocity that depends non-linearly on the concentration of the chemical species and its local gradient. To study this process more effectively, we optimised a 3-channel microfluidic device designed to create a stable gradient of chemoattractants. This setup allows us to simultaneously monitor the response of Escherichia coli to casamino acids or alpha-methyl-DL-aspartic acid at the individual level.</description>

      <title>Conservation of magnetic-helicity fluctuations due to spatial decorrelation of fluxes in decaying MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hosking &amp; Schekochihin (2021, Phys. Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes -- or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor &amp; Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation.</description>

Abstract: Dryers play a central role in the processing of phosphate rock, where moisture removal is essential for downstream handling and energy efficiency. Due to the inherently nonlinear and multivariable nature of these systems, accurate modeling and control remain industrial challenges.

      <title>Resolving Thermospheric Vertical Wind Ambiguities and Energy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applies a generalized vertical coordinate system approach alongside thermodynamic control volume analysis to explore the nuanced interpretations of energy transfer processes associated with vertical motion in the thermosphere. Using simulations from the TIEGCM V3.0 model, a key finding reveals that transforming vertical winds in height coordinates onto constant pressure surfaces contain a substantial lifting component; an aspect often overlooked in previous research. This distinction is critical for internal energy assessments, as vertical winds defined in pressure coordinates directly contribute to the adiabatic heating or cooling rates while only a portion of the vertical wind in height coordinates contributes to these energy changes. These differences are demonstrated through schematic representations of thermodynamic control volumes that model a column of thermospheric gas undergoing various energy transfer processes. Accurately determining the portion of observed vertical winds that affect internal energy requires clear understanding between height and pressure surfaces; a nontrivial challenge in observational contexts. Furthermore, applying the generalized vertical coordinate framework to airglow emissions in the upper thermosphere uncovers an inherent ambiguity: vertical winds inferred from airglow observations may not align with those defined on pressure or altitude surfaces. This insight suggests that discrepancies in the behavior and magnitude of vertical winds derived from FPI observations of red-line emissions in the upper thermosphere are due to poorly known relations between the emission structure relative to pressure or height surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Capillarity-dominated two-phase displacement in porous media often continues beyond the initial invasion-percolation (IP) breakthrough, as surfactants alter interfacial properties and reopen pathways once sealed by capillary forces. This study examines such secondary invasion, where adsorption-driven reductions in interfacial tension and contact-angle shifts lower entry thresholds in yet uninvaded throats, enabling further displacement at a fixed inlet pressure. To capture this process, we employ a time-dependent pore-network framework that couples IP with a reduced-order transport-adsorption module. Local fluxes are governed by Poiseuille flow, interfacial adsorption follows a Langmuir isotherm, and wettability evolution is modeled through a calibrated phenomenological relation. Heterogeneity is prescribed by Gaussian throat-size distributions whose variance controls structural disorder. The resulting invasion trajectories are sigmoidal, consistent with Gaussian cumulative statistics, indicating that surfactant mass-transfer kinetics and network variance primarily rescale invasion timescales while preserving the overall functional form. The framework thus connects interfacial conditioning to time-varying capillary thresholds and reveals how surfactant-mediated processes govern post-breakthrough dynamics in heterogeneous porous systems.</description>

      <title>Mass diffusion and bending in dynamic wetting by phase-field and sharp-interface models</title>

Abstract: Dynamic wetting poses a well-known challenge in classical sharp-interface formulation as the no-slip wall condition leads to a contact line singularity that is typically regularized with a Navier boundary condition, often requiring empirical fitting for the slip length. On the other hand, this paradox does not appear in phase-field models as the contact line moves through diffusive mass transport. In this work, we present a toy model that accounts for mass diffusion at the contact line within a sharp-interface framework. This model is based on a theoretical relation derived from the Cahn-Hilliard equations, which links the total diffusive mass transport to the curvature at the wall. From an estimate of the chemical potential on a curved interface, we obtain an expression for the width of the highly curved region $\delta$ and the apparent angle. In the sharp-interface model, we then introduce a fictitious boundary, displaced by a distance $\delta$ into the domain, where a Navier boundary condition is applied along a dynamic apparent contact angle that accounts for the local interface bending. The robustness of the model is assessed by comparing the toy model results with standard phase-field ones on two cases: the steady state profiles of a liquid bridge between two plates moving in opposite directions and the transient behaviors of a drop spreading on a solid with a prescribed equilibrium angle. This offers a practical and efficient alternative to solve contact line problems at lower cost in a sharp-interface framework with input parameters from phase-field models.</description>
