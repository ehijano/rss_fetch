      <title>Interaction of jamitons in second-order macroscopic traffic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamitons are self-sustained traveling wave solutions that arise in certain second-order macroscopic models of vehicular traffic. A necessary condition for a jamiton to appear is that the local traffic density breaks the so-called sub-characteristic condition. This condition states that the characteristic velocity of the corresponding first-order Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model formed with the same desired speed function is enclosed by the characteristic speeds of the corresponding second-order model. The phenomenon of collision of jamitons in second-order models of traffic flow is studied analytically and numerically for the particular case of the second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model [A.\ Aw, M.\ Rascle, {\it SIAM J.\ Appl.\ Math.} {\bf 60} (2000) 916--938; H.\ M.\ Zhang, {\it Transp.\ Res.\ B} {\bf 36} (2002) 275--290]. A compatibility condition is first defined to select jamitons that can collide each other. The collision of jamitons produces a new jamiton with a velocity different from the initial ones. It is observed that the exit velocities smooth out the velocity of the test jamiton and the initial velocities of the jamitons that collide. Other properties such as the amplitude of the exit jamitons, lengths, and maximum density are also explored.In the cases of the amplitude and maximum exit density it turns out that over a wide range of sonic densities, the exit values exceed or equal the input values. On the other hand, the resulting jamiton has a greater length than the incoming ones. Finally, the behavior for various driver reaction times is explored. It is obtained that some properties do not depend on that time, such as the amplitude, exit velocity, or maximum density, while the exit length does depend on driver reaction time.</description>

      <title>Local boundedness of solutions to parabolic equations associated with fractional $p$-Laplacian type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local boundedness of local weak solutions to the following parabolic equation associated with fractional $p$-Laplacian type operators $$ \partial_t u(t,x)-\text{p.v.}\int_{\R^d}|u(t,y)-u(t,x)|^{p-2}(u(t,y)-u(t,x))J(t;x,y)\,dy=0,\quad (t,x)\in \R\times \R^d, $$ where $\text{p.v.}$ means the integral in the principal value sense, $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $J(t;x,y)$ is comparable to the kernel of the fractional $p$-Laplacian operator $|x-y|^{-d-sp}$ with $s\in(0,1)$ and uniformly in $(t;x,y)\in\R\times\R^d\times\R^d$. Unlike existing results in the literature, the local boundedness of the solutions obtained in this paper extends the known results for the linear case (i.e., the case that $p=2$), in particular with a nonlocal parabolic tail that uses the $L^1$-norm in time for all $p\in (1,\infty)$. The proof is based on a new level set truncation in the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration and a careful choice of iteration orders, as well as a general Caccioppoli-type inequality that is efficiently applied to fractional $p$-Laplacian type operators with all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in an inverse problem for the active scalar equations with fractional dissipation on the torus. Our argument relies on the divergence-free structure in the nonlinear term, the second order linearization, the unique continuation property of the fractional Laplacian and its associated Runge approximation property.</description>

      <title>Free energy minimizers with radial densities: classification and quantitative stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem with a potential energy $g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ weighted by a radial density $f$ and analyze the geometric properties of minimizers. Notably, we construct two counterexamples demonstrating that, in contrast to the classical isoperimetric case $g = 0$, the condition $\ln(f)'' + g' \geq 0$ does not generally guarantee the global optimality of centered spheres. However, we demonstrate that centered spheres are globally optimal when both $f$ and $g$ are monotone. Additionally, we strengthen this result by deriving a sharp quantitative stability inequality.</description>

      <title>Convergence of boundary layers of chemotaxis models with physical boundary conditions~II: Non-degenerate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the convergence of boundary-layer solutions of the consumption type Keller-Segel model with non-degenerate initial data subject to physical boundary conditions, which is a sequel of \cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} on the case of degenerate initial data. Specifically, we justify that the solution with positive chemical diffusion rate $\varepsilon&gt;0 $ converges to the solution with zero diffusion $\varepsilon=0 $ (outer-layer solution) plus the boundary-layer profiles (inner-layer solution) for any time $t&gt;0$ as $ \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 $. Compared to \cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing}, the main difficulty in the analysis is the lack of regularity of the outer- and boundary-layer profiles since only the zero-order compatibility conditions for the leading-order boundary-layer profiles can be fulfilled with non-degenerate initial data. Our new strategy is to regularize the boundary-layer profiles with carefully designed corner-corrector functions and approximate the low-regularity leading-order boundary-layer profiles by higher-regularity profiles with regularized boundary conditions. By using delicate weight functions involving boundary-layer profiles to cancel the multi-scaled linear terms in the perturbed equations, we manage to obtain the requisite uniform-in-$ \varepsilon $ estimates for the convergence analysis. This cancellation technique enables us to prove the convergence to boundary-layer solutions for any time $ t &gt;0 $, which is different from the convergence result in \cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} which holds true only for some finite time depending on the Dirichlet boundary value.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and analysis of a tumor invasion problem with angiogenesis and taxis cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical model for tumor invasion supported by angiogenesis and interactions with the surrounding tissue. For the model deduction we employ a multiscale approach starting from lower scales and obtaining by an informal parabolic upscaling a system of reaction-diffusion-taxis equations with a so-called 'taxis cascade', where one species is performing taxis towards a signal whose production/decay is controled by the other, for which it also serves as a tactic cue. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the obtained PDE-ODE system and perform numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near the ground state for the Sobolev critical Fujita type heat equation in 6D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in the Sobolev critical case.
  Our main result is a classification of the dynamics near the ground states in the six dimensional case.
  It is shown that solutions starting near the ground states fall into one of the following three scenarios:
  - They are globally defined and converge to one of the ground states as $t\to\infty$.
  - They are globally defined and converge to $0$ in $\dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^6)$ as $t\to\infty$.
  - They exhibit finite time blowup with a type I rate.
  This paper extends the classification result in the case $n\geq7$, previously obtained by Collot-Merle-Rapha\"el, to the borderline case $n=6$.</description>

      <title>Sharp-Interface Limit of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we derive the sharp-interface limit of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot equations using formal matched asymptotic expansions. We find that in each sub-domain, the quasi-static Biot equations are obtained with domain-specific material parameters. Moreover, across the interface, material displacement and pore pressure are continuous, while volumetric fluid content and normal stress are balanced. By utilizing the energy of the system, the phase-field potential is shown to be influenced by the curvature, along with contributions from both flow and elasticity at the interface. The normal velocity of the interface is proportional to the jump in normal derivative of the phase-field potential across the interface. Finally, we present a numerical experiment that demonstrates how the location of each phase evolves consistently as the diffuse-interface width parameter becomes smaller; only the width of the diffuse interface changes.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained walls in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study geometrically constrained magnetic walls in a three dimensional geometry where two bulks are connected by a thin neck. Without imposing any symmetry assumption on the domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy as the size of the neck vanishes. We identify five significant scaling regimes, for all of which we characterize the energy scaling; in some cases, we are also able to identify the asymptotic behavior of the domain wall. Finally, we notice the emergence of sub-regimes that are not present int previous works due to restrictive symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics for the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in critical spaces for any dimension greater or equal than three. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on initial data at or below the ground state that dichotomizes the behavior of solutions. Specifically, this criterion determines whether the solution will either exist globally with energy decaying to zero over time or blow up in finite time. Secondly, we derive the decay rate for solutions that exist globally. These results offer a comprehensive characterization of solution behavior for energy-critical conditions in higher-dimensional settings</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general version of Egorov's theorem for evolution propagators in the Euclidean space, in the Weyl--H\"ormander framework of metrics on the phase space. Mild assumptions on the Hamiltonian allow for a wide range of applications that we describe in the paper, including Schr\"odinger, wave and transport evolutions. We also quantify an Ehrenfest time and describe the full symbol of the conjugated operator. Our main result is a consequence of a stronger theorem on the propagation of quantum partitions of unity.</description>

      <title>Intertwining operators beyond the Stark Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main mathematical manifestation of the Stark effect in quantum mechanics is the shift and the formation of clusters of eigenvalues when a spherical Hamiltonian is perturbed by lower order terms. Understanding this mechanism turned out to be fundamental in the description of the large-time asymptotics of the associated Schr\"odinger groups and can be responsible for the lack of dispersion in Fanelli, Felli, Fontelos and Primo [Comm. Math. Phys., 324(2013), 1033-1067; 337(2015), 1515-1533]. Recently, Miao, Su, and Zheng introduced in [Tran. Amer. Math. Soc., 376(2023), 1739--1797] a family of spectrally projected intertwining operators, reminiscent of the Kato's wave operators, in the case of constant perturbations on the sphere (inverse-square potential), and also proved their boundedness in $L^p$. Our aim is to establish a general framework in which some suitable intertwining operators can be defined also for non constant spherical perturbations in space dimensions 2 and higher. In addition, we investigate the mapping properties between $L^p$-spaces of these operators. In 2D, we prove a complete result, for the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian with a (fixed) magnetic potential an electric potential, both scaling critical, allowing us to prove dispersive estimates, uniform resolvent estimates, and $L^p$-bounds of Bochner--Riesz means. In higher dimensions, apart from recovering the example of inverse-square potential, we can conjecture a complete result in presence of some symmetries (zonal potentials), and open some interesting spectral problems concerning the asymptotics of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undercompressive shocks are a special type of discontinuities that satisfy the viscous profile criterion rather than the Lax inequalities. These shocks can appear as a solution to systems of two or more conservation laws. This paper presents the construction of the undercompressive shock surface for two types of diffusion matrices. The first type is the identity matrix. The second one is the capillarity matrix associated with the proper modeling of the diffusive effects caused by capillary pressure. We show that the structure of the undercompressive surface for the different diffusion matrices is similar. We also show how the choice of the capillarity matrix influences the solutions to the Riemann problem.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed, leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion paper we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>The essential self-adjointness of the wave operator on radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

      <title>Peculiar behavior of the principal Laplacian eigenvalue for large negative Robin parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 2$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain with outer unit normal $\nu$. For $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ let $R_\Omega^\alpha$ be the Laplacian in $\Omega$ with the Robin boundary condition $\partial_\nu u+\alpha u=0$, and denote by $E(R^\alpha_\Omega)$ its principal eigenvalue. In 2017 Bucur, Freitas and Kennedy stated the following open question: Does the limit of the ratio $E(R_\Omega^\alpha)/ \alpha^2$ for $\alpha\to-\infty$ always exist? We give a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical analysis of an elapsed time model with strongly coupled neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes the dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we first deal with the case when transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case when there exists a distributed delay that depends on the previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Then we revisit the well-posedness in order to make a numerical analysis by adapting the classical upwind scheme through a fixed-point approach. We improve the previous results on well-posedness by relaxing some hypotheses on the non-linearity for instantaneous transmission, including the strongly excitatory case, while for the numerical analysis we prove that the approximation given by the explicit upwind scheme converges to the solution of the non-linear problem through BV-estimates. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue problems for the de Rham complex on varying three dimensional domains. Our analysis includes the Helmholtz equation as well as the Maxwell system with mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. We provide Hadamard-type formulas for the shape derivatives under weak regularity assumptions on the domain and its perturbations. Our proofs are based on abstract results adapted to varying Hilbert complexes. As a bypass product of our analysis we give a proof of the celebrated Helmann-Feynman theorem both for simple and multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space depending on possibly infinite dimensional parameters. This series of papers consists of Parts I and II.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript addresses the local well-posedness theories for the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness within suitable weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria. These results are applicable to the low-regularity solutions, in the sense that, the pointwise regularities of the free boundaries and the velocity fields restricted to them could merely be $C^{1.5+}$ and $C^{1+}$, respectively.
  This is the first well-posedness result for the full compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum for space dimensions not restricted to one. The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the isotropic relaxed micromorphic model in polar coordinates and use this representation to solve explicitly an elastostatic axisymmetric extension problem involving a linear system of ordinary differential equations. To obtain an analytical solution, modified Bessel functions are utilized and closed-form solutions for the displacement and microdistortion are obtained. We show how certain limit cases (classical linear elasticity), which are naturally included in the relaxed micromorphic model, can be efficiently achieved. Furthermore, numerical results are calculated and the effects of various parameters are examined. The results can be used to calibrate and check corresponding finite element codes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the half plane at high Reynolds number regime, when the initial vorticity belongs to the Yudovich class and is supported away from the boundary. We prove the $L^p$ ($2\leq p&lt; \infty$) convergence from the Naiver-Stokes equations to the Euler equations. The key point is to introduce a good functional framework to control the interaction between rough vortex patch and boundary layer.</description>

Abstract: For the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation,$$\lambda u+H(x,d_x u)=0, \ x \in M, $$we construct $C^{1,1}$ subsolutions which are indeed solutions on the projected Aubry set. The smoothness of such subsolutions can be improved under additional hyperbolicity assumptions. As applications, we can use such subsolutions to identify the maximal global attractor of the associated conformally symplectic flow and to control the convergent speed of the Lax-Oleinik semigroups</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending our previous works on the Cauchy problem for the $2+1$ equivariant Einstein-wave map system, we prove that the linear part dominates the nonlinear part of the wave maps equation coupled to the full set of the Einstein equations, for small data. A key ingredient in the proof is a nonlinear Morawetz estimate for the fully coupled equivariant Einstein-wave maps. The $2+1$ dimensional Einstein-wave map system occurs naturally in the U(1) symmetric $3+1$ dimensional vacuum Einstein equations of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shot-down process is a strong Markov process which is annihilated, or shot down, when jumping over or to the complement of a given open subset of a vector space. Due to specific features of the shot-down time, such processes suggest new type of boundary conditions for nonlocal differential equations. In this work we construct the shot-down process for the fractional Laplacian in Euclidean space. For smooth bounded sets $D$, we study its transition density and characterize Dirichlet form. We show that the corresponding Green function is comparable to that of the fractional Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions on $D$. However, for nonconvex $D$, the transition density of the shot-down stable process is incomparable with the Dirichlet heat kernel of the fractional Laplacian for $D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a slow-fast system of coupled three dimensional Navier--Stokes equations where the fast component is perturbed by an additive Brownian noise. By means of the rough path theory, we establish the convergence in law of the slow component towards a Navier--Stokes system with an It{\^o}--Stokes drift and a rough path driven transport noise. This gives an alternative, more general and direct proof to \cite{DP22}. Notably, the limiting rough path is identified as a geometric rough path, which does not necessarily coincide with the Stratonovich lift of the Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We start by taking the analytical approach to discuss how the minimizer of Yamabe functional provides constant scalar curvature and its relationship with the Sobolev Space $W^{1,2}.$ Then, after demonstrating the importance of the sphere $S^n$, with stereographic projection and dilation, we show that the minimizer of Yamabe functional on standard sphere is obtained from a standard round metric $\bar{g}$ by a conformal diffeomorphism, thus giving us the constraint $\lambda (M) &lt; \lambda(S^n),$ which leads us to the final theorem that the Yamabe problem is solvable when $\lambda(M) &lt; \lambda(S^n).$ For the proof of this theorem, we adopt the approach of Concentration-Compactness.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players. Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in $L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous work.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>
