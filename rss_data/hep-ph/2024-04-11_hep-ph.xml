      <title>Complete Optimal Non-Resonant Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first-ever complete, model-agnostic search strategy based on the optimal anomaly score, for new physics on the tails of distributions. Signal sensitivity is achieved via a classifier trained on auxiliary features in a weakly-supervised fashion, and backgrounds are predicted using the ABCD method in the classifier output and the primary tail feature. The independence between the classifier output and the tail feature required for ABCD is achieved by first training a conditional normalizing flow that yields a decorrelated version of the auxiliary features; the classifier is then trained on these features. Both the signal sensitivity and background prediction require a sample of events accurately approximating the SM background; we assume this can be furnished by closely related control processes in the data or by accurate simulations, as is the case in countless conventional analyses. The viability of our approach is demonstrated for signatures consisting of (mono)jets and missing transverse energy, where the main SM background is $Z(\nu \nu) +\text{jets}$, and the data-driven control process is $\gamma+\text{jets}$.</description>

      <title>Determination of $K^0_S$ Fragmentation Functions including BESIII Measurements and using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the extraction of parton-to-$K^0_S$ hadron fragmentation functions, named FF24-$K^0_S$, focusing on both next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy in perturbative QCD. Our approach involves the analysis of single inclusive electron-positron annihilation (SIA) data. The two key improvements are, on the one hand, the incorporation of the latest experimental data from the BESIII experiment and, on the other hand, the adoption of Neural Networks in the fitting procedure. To address experimental uncertainties, the Monte Carlo method is employed. Our investigation also explores the impact of hadron mass corrections on the description of SIA data, spanning a broad kinematic regime with a particular emphasis on the range of small $z$ values. The theory prediction for $K^0_S$ production at both NLO and NNLO accuracy exhibits good agreement with experimental data within their respective uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Quantitative calculations for reactor neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos contribute significantly to irreducible backgrounds through their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei in liquid-scintillator detectors, impacting diffuse supernova neutrino background, nucleon decay, and reactor neutrinos. This paper extends our prior work by systematically studying the NC backgrounds towards the MeV region of reactor neutrinos. We employ contemporary neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro for calculations, with a focus on predicting NC background in experimental searches for inverse-beta-decay signals below 100 MeV visible energy. We estimate the systematic uncertainty to our estimation of the NC background using various data-driven neutrino generator models, addressing factors such as the initial neutrino-nucleon NC interaction, the nuclear model, the final-state interaction model, the nucleus deexcitation, and the secondary interaction on final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference with Gaussian Processes for the Determination of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a Bayesian methodology for the solution of the inverse problem underlying the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs). In our approach, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are used to model the PDF prior, while Bayes theorem is used in order to determine the posterior distribution of the PDFs given a set of data. We discuss the general formalism, the Bayesian inference at the level of both parameters and hyperparameters, and the simplifications which occur when the observable entering the analysis is linear in the PDF. We benchmark the new methodology in two simple examples for the determination of a single PDF flavor from a set of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) data and from a set of equal-time correlators computed using lattice QCD. We discuss our results, showing how the proposed methodology allows for a well-defined statistical interpretation of the different sources of errors entering the PDF uncertainty, and how results can be validated a posteriori.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in $B \to K\ell^+\ell^-$ Decays: New Opportunities in the High-Precision Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data on rare $B$-meson decays indicate deviations from Standard Model predictions. In studies of these decays, possible new sources of CP violation are often neglected. We discuss CP violation in the rare $B$-meson decays $B\to K\ell^+\ell^- (\ell = \mu,e)$ and point to two phenomena that arise when new sources of CP violation are included. First, the Wilson coefficients $C_{9\ell}$ and $C_{10\ell}$ become complex, and we show how we can extract their values from measurements of direct and mixing-induced CP asymmetries. Second, new sources of CP violation can generate nontrivial lepton flavour universality violation. Such a violation is usually measured through ratios like $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, but we show that measuring only these ratios leaves a large parameter space unexplored. These results bring exciting opportunities to reveal New Physics effects in the high-precision era.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Forbidden Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the ``forbidden'' dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>Structure-dependent QED in $B^- \to \ell^- \bar \nu (\gamma)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on explicitly gauge invariant interpolating operators we compute complete next-leading order QED-corrections for leptonic decays. These are sizeable since the helicity-suppression in V-A interactions allows for structure-dependent collinear logs. We have explicitly checked that these logs are absent for helicity-unsuppressed Yukawa-type transitions. Based on $B \to \gamma$ form factors we present the rates for $B^- \to (\mu^-,\tau^-) \bar \nu (\gamma)$ in differential and integrated form as a function of the photon energy cut-off $E_\gamma^{\text{cut}}$. The effect of the virtual structure-dependent corrections are approximately $+5\%$ and $+3\%$ for the $\mu$- and $\tau$-channel respectively. The structure dependence of the real radiation exceeds that of the virtual one for $E_\gamma^{\text{cut}}|_{\mu} &gt; 0.18(3)$ GeV and is subdominant for the tau channel even when fully inclusive.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis used for quantifying quantum complexity and entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and Krylov entropy matches entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Productions of $X(3872)$/$Z_c(3900)$ and $X_2(4013)$/$Z_c(4020)$ in $Y(4220)$ and $Y(4360)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two excited vector charmonium states $Y(4220)$ and $Y(4360)$ are difficult to be understood as pure $c\bar{c}$ charmonium states. Since they are located close to the mass thresholds of $\bar{D}D_{1}$ and $\bar{D}^*D_{1}$, they can be viewed as $\bar{D}D_{1}$ and $\bar{D}^*D_{1}$ molecules. Furthermore, recent studies indicated that the exotic states $X(3872)$/$Z_c(3900)$ and $X_2(4013)$/$Z_c(4020)$ are the isoscalar/isovector $\bar{D}D^{*}$ and isoscalar/isovector $\bar{D}^*D^{*}$ molecules, respectively. In this work, in the molecular picture, we employ the triangle diagram mechanism to study the productions of $ Z_{c}(3900) $ and $X(3872)$ in the pionic and radiative decays of $Y(4220)$, as well as their heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS) partners, i.e., the productions of $Z_{c}(4020)$ and $X_2(4013)$ in the pionic and radiative decays of $Y(4360)$. Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we obtain the ratios of the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}[Y(4360) \to Z_c(4020)\pi]/\mathcal{B}[Y(4220)\to Z_c(3900)\pi]=1.2$ and $\mathcal{B}[Y(4360)\to X_2(4013) \gamma]/\mathcal{B}[Y(4220)\to X(3872)\gamma]=0.5$, almost independent of model parameters, which indicate that the productions of $X_2(4013)$ and $Z_c(4020)$ in the radiative and pionic decays of $Y(4360)$ are likely to be measured in the future. The experimental studies of the predicted decay modes will help verify the molecular nature of $X(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$, and $Y(4220)$. We hope the present work can stimulate experimental and further theoretical studies on these decay modes.</description>

      <title>Leptonic and semileptonic decays of mesons in the Domain model of QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leptonic and semileptonic decays of mesons are investigated within the Domain model of QCD vacuum and hadronization. The Domain Model is the mean-field approach based on the statistical ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon fields which reproduces main features of low-energy QCD and allows to deduce a nonlocal effective meson action. Using this meson action, the leptonic decay constants, form factors and branching ratios of semileptonic decays are evaluated simultaneously with masses of mesons. The results are compared to experimental data or other approaches.</description>

      <title>Parton-shower effects in polarized deep inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte-Carlo program for the simulation of polarized deep inelastic scattering at next-to-leading order in QCD matched to parton shower programs building on an existing implementation of the unpolarized case in the POWHEG BOX package. We discuss extensions of the POWHEG BOX framework necessary to account for polarized initial states and validate the code by detailed comparisons to existing fixed-order results. We then use the new tool to make predictions for the upcoming Electron Ion Collider. We find that parton-shower effects do have an impact on experimentally accessible distributions and improve the agreement with the next-to-next-to-leading order results.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark sectors in supernovae are fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN~1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Baryon junction effects on charmonium production in pp and pPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the effects of the proton and $Pb$ internal structure on charmonium production at high multiplicities. To do this, we assume that the nucleon has an Y shape, which means that the effective quarks (quarks + antiquarks + gluons) are in the extremities of the Y, connected by gluon lines. Since the quarks are in the periphery and the gluons are in the center, as $pp$ collisions go from peripheral to more central and then to ultra-central collisions, the interactions change from quark-quark to gluon-gluon. The enhanced growth of $J/\psi$ occurs because $\sigma( g + g \to c + \bar{c}) \gg \sigma( q + \bar{q} \to c + \bar{c})$. In the $p-Pb$ collisions the enhancement is caused by the high concentration of partons in the center of the nuclei. These effects can explain the growth seen in the data and give support to the Y picture of the proton.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, in the context of a scalar version of the chiral effective field theory, that the multi-sea quark contribution to the nucleon is significant and highly non-trivial in sharp contrast to the prediction of perturbation theory. The non-perturbative calculation is performed in the Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme on the light front, in which the non-perturbative renormalization is incorporated. The calculation suggests that a fully non-perturbative calculation of the chiral EFT is needed to obtain a robust result to be compared with the recent experimental measurement of flavor asymmetry in the proton.</description>

      <title>Improved analysis of double $J/\psi$ production in $Z$-boson decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved calculation for the decay rate of the rare $Z$-boson decay into $J/\psi + J/\psi$. This decay is dominated by the photon fragmentation mechanism, i.e., the transition $Z\to J/\psi + \gamma^{*}$ followed by the fragmentation $\gamma^{*}\to J/\psi$. In our calculation, the amplitude of $\gamma^{*}\to J/\psi$ is extracted from the measured value of $\Gamma(J/\psi \to e^+ e^-)$, and the amplitude of $Z\to J/\psi + \gamma^{*}$ is calculate through the light-cone approach. The higher-order QCD and relativistic corrections in the amplitude of $\gamma^{*}\to J/\psi$ and the large logarithms of $m_{_Z}^2/m_c^2$ that appear in the amplitude of $Z\to J/\psi + \gamma^{*}$ are resummed in our calculation. Besides, the non-fragmentation amplitude is calculated based on the NRQCD factorization, and the next-to-leading order QCD and relativistic corrections are included. The obtained branching fraction for this $Z$ decay channel is $8.66 ^{+1.48} _{-0.69}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Trials Factor for Semi-Supervised NN Classifiers in Searches for Narrow Resonances at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the model dependencies of searches for new narrow resonances at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), semi-supervised Neural Networks (NNs) can be used. Unlike fully supervised classifiers these models introduce an additional look-elsewhere effect in the process of optimising thresholds on the response distribution. We perform a frequentist study to quantify this effect, in the form of a trials factor. As an example, we consider simulated $Z\gamma$ data to perform narrow resonance searches using semi-supervised NN classifiers. The results from this analysis provide substantiation that the look-elsewhere effect induced by the semi-supervised NN is under control.</description>

      <title>Approaches to photon absorption in a Lorentz invariance violation scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>On the addition of a large scalar multiplet to the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the addition of a single $SU(2)$ multiplet of complex scalar fields to the Standard Model (SM). We explicitly consider the various possible values of the weak isospin $J$ of that multiplet, up to and including $J = 7/2$. We allow the multiplet to have arbitrary weak hypercharge. The scalar fields of the multiplet are assumed to have no vacuum expectation value; the mass differences among the components of the multiplet originate in its coupling, present in the scalar potential (SP), to the Higgs doublet of the SM. We derive exact bounded-from-below and unitarity conditions on the SP, thereby constraining those mass differences. We compare those constraints to the ones that may be derived from the oblique parameters.</description>

      <title>Novel first-order phase transition and critical points in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with spatial compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime in an effective-model approach. The model incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables, and is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in the deconfined phase, which terminates at critical points that should belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induced by their cross term in the Polyakov-loop potential is responsible for the manifestation of the first-order transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional dataset into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Reionization after JWST: a photon budget crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are revealing the first galaxies to be prolific producers of ionizing photons, which we argue gives rise to a tension between different probes of reionization. For hydrogen reionization to proceed there must be enough ionizing photons for all of the hydrogen atoms, including their recombinations. Over the last two decades a consensus has emerged where star-forming galaxies are able to generate these photons, given reasonable values for their number densities, ionizing efficiencies $\xi_{\rm ion}$ (per unit UV luminosity), and escape fractions $f_{\rm esc}$. However, new JWST observations infer high values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ during reionization and an enhanced abundance of earlier ($z\gtrsim 9$) galaxies, dramatically increasing the number of ionizing photons produced at high $z$. Simultaneously, recent low-$z$ studies predict significant escape fractions for faint reionization-era galaxies. Put together, we show that the galaxies we have directly observed ($M_{\rm UV} &lt; -15$) not only can drive reionization, but would end it too early. That is, our current galaxy observations, taken at face value, imply an excess of ionizing photons and thus a process of reionization in tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Considering galaxies down to $M_{\rm UV}\approx -11$, below current observational limits, only worsens this tension, requiring on average $f_{\rm esc}\approx 3\%$, far lower than expected for early galaxies from post-reionization studies. We discuss possible avenues to resolve this photon budget crisis, including missing astrophysical or observational selection effects, as well as enhanced recombinations.</description>

      <title>Hot New Early Dark Energy bridging cosmic gaps: Supercooled phase transition reconciles (stepped) dark radiation solutions to the Hubble tension with BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model that can alleviate the $H_0$ tension while remaining consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). It is based on a dark sector described by a standard Lagrangian featuring a $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry with $N\geq3$ and a massive scalar field with a quartic coupling. The scalar acts as dark Higgs leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking $SU(N)\to SU(N\!-\!1)$ via a first-order phase transition \`a la Coleman-Weinberg. This set-up naturally realizes previously proposed scenarios featuring strongly interacting dark radiation (SIDR) with a mass threshold within hot new early dark energy (NEDE). For a wide range of reasonable model parameters, the phase transition occurs between the BBN and recombination epochs and releases a sufficient amount of latent heat such that the model easily respects bounds on extra radiation during BBN while featuring a sufficient SIDR density around recombination for increasing the value of $H_0$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Our model can be summarized as a natural mechanism providing two successive increases in the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom after BBN but before recombination $\Delta N_\mathrm{BBN} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{NEDE} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{IR}$ alleviating the Hubble tension. The first step is related to the phase transition and the second to the dark Higgs becoming non-relativistic. This set-up predicts further signatures, including a stochastic gravitational wave background and features in the matter power spectrum that can be searched for with future pulsar timing and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We propose the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory coupled with the 2-flavor Wilson-Dirac fermion as a toy model for studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero density. We study its phase diagram in the space of the lattice gauge couplings $g^2$ and the quark chemical potentials $\mu$ and discuss the similarity and difference compared with anticipated behaviors of actual QCD. This model also provides a testing ground for various algorithms of the numerical Hamiltonian formalism as its Hilbert space is finite-dimensional in a finite box.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically-dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe or proto-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Distributions and Collision Rates of ALP Stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply current analytical knowledge on the characteristic mass and linear evolution of miniclusters down to redshift $z=0$ to the hypothetical minicluster distribution of the Milky Way. Using the mass-radius relation and a core-halo relation for stable soliton solutions composed of axion-like particles (ALPs), we connect the galactic minicluster mass distribution to that of their ALP star cores. We consider different temperature evolutions of the ALP field with masses in the range $10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-3}\,$eV and infer the abundance and properties of QCD axion- and ALP stars in our galaxy. We re-evaluate detection prospects for collisions of neutron stars with both ALP stars and miniclusters as well as relativistic ALP bursts, so-called Bosenovae. Our analysis shows that the collision rates between miniclusters and neutron stars can become as large as $\sim 10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, but that the fraction of encounters that can lead to resonance between ALP mass and magnetosphere plasma frequency is generally well below $\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, depending on the ALP model. We confirm previous results that merger rates of ALP stars are extremely small $&lt; 10^{-12}\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, while their host miniclusters can merge much more frequently, up to $\sim 10^3\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ for the QCD axion. We find that Bosenovae and parametric resonance are much more likely to lead to observable signatures than neutron star encounters. We also suggest that a combination of accretion and parametric resonance can lead to observable radio lines for a wide range of ALP masses $m_a$ and photon-couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Insights from PSR J0437-4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector and isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars, while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic model that does not include a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of neutron-star properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.15$ km radius in the posterior of the neutron-star mass-radius relationship.</description>

Abstract: We present the first calculation for the hadroproduction of a $W$ boson in association with a massive bottom ($b$) quark-antiquark pair at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. We exploit the hierarchy between the $b$ quark mass and the characteristic energy scale of the process to obtain a reliable analytic expression for the two-loop virtual amplitude with three massive legs, starting from the corresponding result available for massless bottom quarks. The use of massive $b$ quarks avoids the ambiguities associated with the correct flavour assignment in massless calculations, paving the way to a more realistic comparison with experimental data. We present phenomenological results considering proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV for inclusive $Wb \bar b$ production and within a fiducial region relevant for the associated production of a $W$ boson and a Higgs boson decaying into a $b \bar b$ pair, for which $Wb \bar b$ production represents one of the most relevant backgrounds. We find that the NNLO corrections are substantial and that their inclusion is mandatory to obtain reliable predictions.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ by considering decay and coupled-channels effects</title>

Abstract: The compositeness of weakly bound states is discussed using the effective field theory from the viewpoint of the low-energy universality. We introduce a model with coupling of the single-channel scattering to the bare state, and study the compositeness of the bound state by varying the bare state energy. In contrast to the naive expectation that the near-threshold states are dominated by the molecular structure, we demonstrate that a non-composite state can always be realized even with a small binding energy. At the same time, however, it is shown that a fine tuning is necessary to obtain the non-composite weakly bound state. In other words, the probability of finding a model with the composite dominant state becomes larger with the decrease of the binding energy in accordance with the low-energy universality. For the application to exotic hadrons, we then discuss the modification of the compositeness due to the decay and coupled-channels effects. We quantitatively show that these contributions suppress the compositeness, because of the increase of the fraction of other components. Finally, as examples of near-threshold exotic hadrons, the structures of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ are studied by evaluating the compositeness. We find the importance of the coupled-channels and decay contributions for the structures of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Effect of color reconnection and rope formation on strange particle production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange particles are produced only during high-energy collisions and carry important information regarding collision dynamics. Recent results by the ALICE Collaboration on strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity p+p collisions have highlighted the importance of the rope hadronization mechanism in high-energy nucleon-nucleon collisions. With the help of the \texttt{PYTHIA8} model, we made an attempt to study the strange particle production in high-energy p+p collisions at the LHC energy in the light of different color reconnection models and rope hadronization mechanism. The effect of color reconnection ranges on different observables is also discussed. The integrated yield of strange hadrons and bayon-to-meson ratios as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are well described by the hadronization mechanism of color ropes together with the QCD-based color reconnection scheme. The increasing trend of the average transverse momentum, $\langle p_{\rm T}\rangle$, as a function of $\langle dN/d\eta \rangle_{|\eta| &lt; 0.5}$ can be explained quantitatively by the MPI-based color reconnection mechanism with a reconnection range of RR = 3.6; on the other hand, it is underestimated by the rope hadronization model.</description>

Abstract: We present the very first constraints on the number of Standard Model (SM) copies with an additional Dirac right-handed neutrino. From cosmology, we are able to pose strong limits on large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, we show that it is possible to account for the right dark matter density in form of stable particles from the dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Neutrinos and New Physics from Forward Heavy Hadron Production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenarios with new physics particles feebly interacting with the Standard Model sector provide compelling candidates for dark matter searches. Geared with a set of new experiments for the detection of neutrinos and long-lived particles the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has joined the hunt for these elusive states. On the theoretical side, this emerging physics program requires reliable estimates of the associated particle fluxes, in particular those arising from heavy hadron decays. In this work, we provide state-of-the-art QCD predictions for heavy hadron production including radiative corrections at next-to-leading order and using parton distribution functions including small-$x$ resummation at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We match our predictions to parton showers to provide a realistic description of hadronisation effects. We demonstrate the utility of our predictions by presenting the energy spectrum of neutrinos from charm hadron decays. Furthermore, we employ our predictions to estimate, for the first time, FASER's sensitivity to electrophilic ALPs, which are predominantly generated in beauty hadron decays.</description>

Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of future hadron colliders to constrain the fermionic Higgs portal, with a focus on scenarios where the new fermions cannot be directly observed in exotic Higgs decays. This portal emerges in various models including twin-Higgs scenarios and dark matter models, posing significant challenges for collider tests. Working in an effective field theory (EFT), we determine the reach of the high-luminosity option of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the high-energy upgrade of the LHC (HE-LHC) and a proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC) in probing the fermionic Higgs portal through off-shell and double-Higgs production. Notably, we find that quantum-enhanced indirect probes offer a better sensitivity than other direct Higgs measurements. We argue that this finding is valid in a wide class of ultraviolet realisations of the EFT. Our study presents a roadmap of a multifaceted search strategy for exploring the fermionic Higgs portal at forthcoming hadron machines.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a Deconstructed Electroweak Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an effective theory of flavour in which the $SU(2)_L$ interaction is `flavour-deconstructed' near the TeV scale. This arises, for example, in UV models that unify all three generations of left-handed fermions via an $Sp(6)_L$ symmetry. Flavour-universality of the electroweak force emerges accidentally (but naturally) from breaking the $\prod_{i=1}^3 SU(2)_{L,i}$ gauge group to its diagonal subgroup, delivering hierarchical fermion masses and left-handed mixing angles in the process. The heavy gauge bosons transform as two $SU(2)_L$ triplets that mediate new flavour non-universal forces. The lighter of these couples universally to the light generations, allowing consistency with flavour bounds even for a TeV scale mass. Constraints from flavour, high mass LHC searches, and electroweak precision are then highly complementary, excluding masses below 9 TeV. The heavier triplet must instead be hundreds of TeV to be consistent with meson mixing constraints. Because only the lighter triplet couples to the Higgs, we find radiative Higgs mass corrections of a few hundred GeV, meaning this model of flavour is arguably natural. The natural region will, however, be almost completely covered by the planned electroweak programme at FCC-ee. On shorter timescales, significant parameter space will be explored by the High-Luminosity LHC measurements at high-$p_T$, and upcoming lepton flavour violation experiments, principally Mu3e.</description>

      <title>Non-factorisable Contributions of Strong-Penguin Operators in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate for the first time a certain class of non-factorisable contributions of the four-quark operators ${\cal O}_{3-6}$ in the weak effective Hamiltonian to the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ decay amplitude. We focus on the case where a virtual photon is radiated from one of the light constituents of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon, in the kinematic situation of large hadronic recoil with an energetic $\Lambda$ baryon in the final state. The effect on the suitably defined ``non-local form factors'' is calculated using the light-cone sum rule approach for a correlator with an interpolating current for the light $\Lambda$ baryon. We find that this approach requires the introduction of new soft functions that generalise the standard light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for the heavy $\Lambda_b$ baryon. We give a heuristic discussion of their properties and a model that relates them to the standard LCDAs. Within this framework, we provide numerical results for the size of the non-local form factors considered.</description>

      <title>High-energy QCD dynamics from bottom flavor fragmentation at the Hi-Lumi LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inclusive production of hadrons with bottom flavor at the LHC and its luminosity upgrade. We describe the collinear fragmentation of singly $b$-flavored hadrons, $B$ mesons and $\Lambda_b$ baryons, via the KKSS07 determination of fragmentation functions, while for charmed $B$ mesons, $B_c(^1S_0)$ and $B_c(^3S_1)$ particles, we employ the novel ZCFW22 set, built on the basis of state-of-the-art nonrelativistic QCD inputs. We use the JETHAD multimodular working environment to analyze rapidity and transverse-momentum distributions for observables sensitive to the associated emission of two hadrons or a hadron-plus-jet system. Our reference formalism is the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid collinear and high-energy factorization, where the standard collinear description is improved by the inclusions of energy logarithms resummed up to the next-to-leading approximation and beyond. We provide a corroborating evidence that $b$-flavor emissions act as fair stabilizers of the high-energy resummation, thus serving as valuable tools for precision studies of high-energy QCD. As a bonus, we highlight that the predicted production-rate hierarchy between noncharmed $b$-hadrons and charmed $B_c(^1S_0)$ mesons is in line with recent LHCb estimates. This serves as simultaneous benchmark both for the hybrid factorization and for the single-parton fragmentation mechanism based on initial-scale inputs calculated via the nonrelativistic QCD effective theory.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>

      <title>Lightcone and quasi distribution amplitudes for light octet and decuplet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of leading-twist lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) and quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) for light octet and decuplet baryons within large momentum effective theory. In LaMET, LCDAs can be factorized in terms of a hard kernel and quasi-DAs that are defined as spatial correlators and calculable on Lattice QCD. To renormalize quasi-DAs and eliminate the singular terms $\ln(\mu^2 z_i^2)'s$ in them, which undermine the efficacy in perturbative expansion, we adopt a hybrid renormalization scheme that combines the self-renormalization and ratio scheme. Through self-renormalization, we eliminate UV divergences and linear divergences at large spatial separations in quasi distribution amplitudes without introducing additional nonperturbative effects. By taking a ratio with respect to the zero-momentum matrix element, we effectively remove UV divergences at small spatial separations. Under the hybrid renormalization scheme, we calculate the hard kernels up to one-loop accuracy. It turns out that only four different hard kernels are needed for all leading-twist LCDAs of octet and decuplet baryons. These results are crucial for the lattice-based exploration of the LCDAs of a light baryon from the first principle of QCD.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation during the QCD phase transition: threshold, mass distribution and abundance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) formation during cosmic phase transitions and annihilation periods, such as the QCD transition or the $e^+e^-$-annihilation, is thought to be particularly efficient due to a softening of the equation of state. We present a detailed numerical study of PBH formation during the QCD epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost) scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak mass of $M_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M_{\odot}$ with a fraction $f\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs having a mass of $M_{\rm pbh} &gt; 10 M_{\odot}$, possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is more complex as it is very close to the epoch of neutrino decoupling. We argue that neutrinos free-streaming out of overdense regions may actually hinder PBH formation.</description>

Abstract: General relativity predicts the existence of only two tensorial gravitational wave polarizations, while a generic metric theories of gravity can possess up to four additional polarizations, including two vector and two scalar ones. These vector/scalar polarizations are in general generated by the intrinsic new vector/scalar degrees of freedom of the specific theories of gravity. In this paper, we show that, with the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the framework of the standard model extension, the additional nontensorial polarizations can be directly excited by the two tensorial degrees of freedom. We consider the diffeomorphism invariant standard model extension in the gravity sector with the Lorentz-violating coefficients $\hat{\boldsymbol s}^{(d)\mu\rho\nu\sigma}$ of the even mass dimension $d\ge4$. In addition to the extra polarizations induced by the tensor modes, the gravitational wave in this theory travels at a speed depending on the propagation direction, experiences dispersion if and only if $d\ge6$, and possesses neither velocity nor amplitude birefringence. The excitement of the extra polarizations is also chiral. The antenna pattern functions of interferometers due to such kind of gravitational waves are generally linear combinations of those for all polarizations. Detected by pulsar timing arrays and the Gaia satellite, the stochastic gravitational wave background in this model could induce couplings among cross correlations, of the redshifts of photons and the astrometric deflections of the positions of pulsars, for different polarizations. These characteristics enable the use of interferometers, pulsar timing arrays and Gaia mission to constrain this model.</description>
