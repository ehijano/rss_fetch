      <title>Estimation of Latent Group Structures in Time-Varying Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a panel data model where coefficients vary both over time and the cross-section. Slope coefficients change smoothly over time and follow a latent group structure, being homogeneous within but heterogeneous across groups. The group structure is identified using a pairwise adaptive group fused-Lasso penalty. The trajectories of time-varying coefficients are estimated via polynomial spline functions. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the penalized and post-selection estimators and show their oracle efficiency. A simulation study demonstrates excellent finite sample properties. An application to the emission intensity of GDP highlights the relevance of addressing cross-sectional heterogeneity and time-variance in empirical settings.</description>

      <title>Forward Selection Fama-MacBeth Regression with Higher-Order Asset Pricing Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the higher-orders and their interactions of the common sparse linear factors can effectively subsume the factor zoo. To this extend, we propose a forward selection Fama-MacBeth procedure as a method to estimate a high-dimensional stochastic discount factor model, isolating the most relevant higher-order factors. Applying this approach to terms derived from six widely used factors (the Fama-French five-factor model and the momentum factor), we show that the resulting higher-order model with only a small number of selected higher-order terms significantly outperforms traditional benchmarks both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, it effectively subsumes a majority of the factors from the extensive factor zoo, suggesting that the pricing power of most zoo factors is attributable to their exposure to higher-order terms of common linear factors.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting demand estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper connects the literature on demand estimation to the literature on causal inference by interpreting nonparametric structural assumptions as restrictions on counterfactual outcomes. It offers nontrivial and equivalent restatements of key demand estimation assumptions in the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes model, for both settings with market-level data (Berry and Haile, 2014) and settings with demographic-specific market shares (Berry and Haile, 2024). This exercise helps bridge the literatures on structural estimation and on causal inference by separating notational and linguistic differences from substantive ones.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Impacts to the Forest Sector: An Analysis of Key U.S. States and Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several key states in various regions have experienced recent sawtimber as well as pulp and paper mill closures, which have resulted in harmful effects to rural, natural-resource dependent communities. This raises an important research question, how will key macroeconomic and related variables for the U.S. forest sector change in the future for highly forest-dependent states? To address this, we employ a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states in the U.S.: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The forecasting results imply that the forestry and logging industry will largely experience decreases in employment and the number of firms. Wood manufacturing has similar findings, but employment is forecasted to increase in general. Paper manufacturing is forecasted to decrease employment, output, and the number of firms, while wages will remain constant. The analysis highlights how timber-based manufacturing communities may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. This type of regional forecasting provides valuable insights for regional policy makers and industry stakeholders, helping them anticipate economic shifts and implement strategies to support affected communities. In addition, the methodology applied in this study can be extended to other non-forestry industries that serve as economic pillars for specific regions such as mining, agriculture, and energy production, offering a framework for assessing economic resilience in resource-dependent communities.</description>

      <title>A Neural Frequency-Severity Model and Its Application to Insurance Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a flexible and analytically tractable class of frequency and severity models for predicting insurance claims. The proposed model is able to capture nonlinear relationships in explanatory variables by characterizing the logarithmic mean functions of frequency and severity distributions as neural networks. Moreover, a potential dependence between the claim frequency and severity can be incorporated. In particular, the paper provides analytic formulas for mean and variance of the total claim cost, making our model ideal for many applications such as pricing insurance contracts and the pure premium. A simulation study demonstrates that our method successfully recovers nonlinear features of explanatory variables as well as the dependency between frequency and severity. Then, this paper uses a French auto insurance claim dataset to illustrate that the proposed model is superior to the existing methods in fitting and predicting the claim frequency, severity, and the total claim loss. Numerical results indicate that the proposed model helps in maintaining the competitiveness of an insurer by accurately predicting insurance claims and avoiding adverse selection.</description>

      <title>Homophily in preferences or meetings? Identifying and estimating an iterative network formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06694v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is homophily in social and economic networks driven by a taste for homogeneity (preferences) or by a higher probability of meeting individuals with similar attributes (opportunity)? This paper studies identification and estimation of an iterative network game that distinguishes between these two mechanisms. Our approach enables us to assess the counterfactual effects of changing the meeting protocol between agents. As an application, we study the role of preferences and meetings in shaping classroom friendship networks in Brazil. In a network structure in which homophily due to preferences is stronger than homophily due to meeting opportunities, tracking students may improve welfare. Still, the relative benefit of this policy diminishes over the school year.</description>

      <title>Identification by non-Gaussianity in structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear structural vector autoregressive models can be identified statistically without imposing restrictions on the model if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. We show that this result extends to structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models incorporating a time-varying impact matrix defined as a weighted sum of the impact matrices of the regimes. We also discuss the problem of labelling the shocks, estimation of the parameters, and stationarity the model. The introduced methods are implemented to the accompanying R package sstvars. Our empirical application studies the effects of the climate policy uncertainty shock on the U.S. macroeconomy. In a structural logistic smooth transition vector autoregressive model with two regimes, we find that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock decreases production and increases inflation in times of both low and high economic policy uncertainty, but its inflationary effects are stronger in the periods of high economic policy uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Endogeneity Corrections in Binary Outcome Models with Nonlinear Transformations: Identification and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For binary outcome models, an endogeneity correction based on nonlinear rank-based transformations is proposed. Identification without external instruments is achieved under one of two assumptions: either the endogenous regressor is a nonlinear function of one component of the error term, conditional on the exogenous regressors, or the dependence between the endogenous and exogenous regressors is nonlinear. Under these conditions, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality. Monte Carlo simulations and an application on German insolvency data illustrate the usefulness of the method.</description>

      <title>Moments by Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Two Level Nested and Sequential Logit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical note provides comprehensive derivations of fundamental equations in two-level nested and sequential logit models for analyzing hierarchical choice structures. We present derivations of the Berry (1994) inversion formula, nested inclusive values computation, and multi-level market share equations, complementing existing literature. While conceptually distinct, nested and sequential logit models share mathematical similarities and, under specific distributional assumptions, yield identical inversion formulas-offering valuable analytical insights. These notes serve as a practical reference for researchers implementing multi-level discrete choice models in empirical applications, particularly in industrial organization and demand estimation contexts, and complement Mansley et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Randomization in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.09458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regression discontinuity designs assess causal effects in settings where treatment is determined by whether an observed running variable crosses a pre-specified threshold. Here we propose a new approach to identification, estimation, and inference in regression discontinuity designs that uses knowledge about exogenous noise (e.g., measurement error) in the running variable. In our strategy, we weight treated and control units to balance a latent variable of which the running variable is a noisy measure. Our approach is driven by effective randomization provided by the noise in the running variable, and complements standard formal analyses that appeal to continuity arguments while ignoring the stochastic nature of the assignment mechanism.</description>
