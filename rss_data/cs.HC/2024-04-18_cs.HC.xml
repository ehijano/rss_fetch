      <title>Evaluating Tenant-Landlord Tensions Using Generative AI on Online Tenant Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tenant-landlord relationships exhibit a power asymmetry where landlords' power to evict the tenants at a low-cost results in their dominating status in such relationships. Tenant concerns are thus often unspoken, unresolved, or ignored and this could lead to blatant conflicts as suppressed tenant concerns accumulate. Modern machine learning methods and Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated immense abilities to perform language tasks. In this study, we incorporate Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with GPT-4 to classify Reddit post data scraped from the subreddit r/Tenant, aiming to unveil trends in tenant concerns while exploring the adoption of LLMs and machine learning methods in social science research. We find that tenant concerns in topics like fee dispute and utility issues are consistently dominant in all four states analyzed while each state has other common tenant concerns special to itself. Moreover, we discover temporal trends in tenant concerns that provide important implications regarding the impact of the pandemic and the Eviction Moratorium.</description>

      <title>Developing Situational Awareness for Joint Action with Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unanswered questions about how human-AV interaction designers can support rider's informational needs hinders Autonomous Vehicles (AV) adoption. To achieve joint human-AV action goals - such as safe transportation, trust, or learning from an AV - sufficient situational awareness must be held by the human, AV, and human-AV system collectively. We present a systems-level framework that integrates cognitive theories of joint action and situational awareness as a means to tailor communications that meet the criteria necessary for goal success. This framework is based on four components of the shared situation: AV traits, action goals, subject-specific traits and states, and the situated driving context. AV communications should be tailored to these factors and be sensitive when they change. This framework can be useful for understanding individual, shared, and distributed human-AV situational awareness and designing for future AV communications that meet the informational needs and goals of diverse groups and in diverse driving contexts.</description>

      <title>CelluloTactix: Towards Empowering Collaborative Online Learning through Tangible Haptic Interaction with Cellulo Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning has soared in popularity in the educational landscape of COVID-19 and carries the benefits of increased flexibility and access to far-away training resources. However, it also restricts communication between peers and teachers, limits physical interactions and confines learning to the computer screen and keyboard. In this project, we designed a novel way to engage students in collaborative online learning by using haptic-enabled tangible robots, Cellulo. We built a library which connects two robots remotely for a learning activity based around the structure of a biological cell. To discover how separate modes of haptic feedback might differentially affect collaboration, two modes of haptic force-feedback were implemented (haptic co-location and haptic consensus). With a case study, we found that the haptic co-location mode seemed to stimulate collectivist behaviour to a greater extent than the haptic consensus mode, which was associated with individualism and less interaction. While the haptic co-location mode seemed to encourage information pooling, participants using the haptic consensus mode tended to focus more on technical co-ordination. This work introduces a novel system that can provide interesting insights on how to integrate haptic feedback into collaborative remote learning activities in future.</description>

      <title>AgentCoord: Visually Exploring Coordination Strategy for LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of automatic task-solving through Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration has recently garnered widespread attention from both the research community and industry. While utilizing natural language to coordinate multiple agents presents a promising avenue for democratizing agent technology for general users, designing coordination strategies remains challenging with existing coordination frameworks. This difficulty stems from the inherent ambiguity of natural language for specifying the collaboration process and the significant cognitive effort required to extract crucial information (e.g. agent relationship, task dependency, result correspondence) from a vast amount of text-form content during exploration. In this work, we present a visual exploration framework to facilitate the design of coordination strategies in multi-agent collaboration. We first establish a structured representation for LLM-based multi-agent coordination strategy to regularize the ambiguity of natural language. Based on this structure, we devise a three-stage generation method that leverages LLMs to convert a user's general goal into an executable initial coordination strategy. Users can further intervene at any stage of the generation process, utilizing LLMs and a set of interactions to explore alternative strategies. Whenever a satisfactory strategy is identified, users can commence the collaboration and examine the visually enhanced execution result. We develop AgentCoord, a prototype interactive system, and conduct a formal user study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Human-AI Collaboration: Agency, Interaction, and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As full AI-based automation remains out of reach in most real-world applications, the focus has instead shifted to leveraging the strengths of both human and AI agents, creating effective collaborative systems. The rapid advances in this area have yielded increasingly more complex systems and frameworks, while the nuance of their characterization has gotten more vague. Similarly, the existing conceptual models no longer capture the elaborate processes of these systems nor describe the entire scope of their collaboration paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new unified set of dimensions through which to analyze and describe human-AI systems. Our conceptual model is centered around three high-level aspects - agency, interaction, and adaptation - and is developed through a multi-step process. Firstly, an initial design space is proposed by surveying the literature and consolidating existing definitions and conceptual frameworks. Secondly, this model is iteratively refined and validated by conducting semi-structured interviews with nine researchers in this field. Lastly, to illustrate the applicability of our design space, we utilize it to provide a structured description of selected human-AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Architecture for Web-based GIS Applications using Docker and Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional planning processes and associated redevelopment projects can be complex due to the vast amount of diverse data involved. However, all of this data shares a common geographical reference, especially in the renaturation of former open-cast mining areas. To ensure safety, it is crucial to maintain a comprehensive overview of the interrelated data and draw accurate conclusions. This requires special tools and can be a very time-consuming process. A geographical information system (GIS) is well-suited for this purpose, but even a GIS has limitations when dealing with multiple data types and sources. Additional tools are often necessary to process and view all the data, which can complicate the planning process. Our paper describes a system architecture that addresses the aforementioned issues and provides a simple, yet flexible tool for these activities. The architecture is based on microservices using Docker and is divided into a backend and a frontend. The backend simplifies and generalizes the integration of different data types, while a graph database is used to link relevant data and reveal potential new relationships between them. Finally, a modern web frontend displays the data and relationships.</description>

      <title>E-Vote Your Conscience: Perceptions of Coercion and Vote Buying, and the Usability of Fake Credentials in Online Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online voting is attractive for convenience and accessibility, but is more susceptible to voter coercion and vote buying than in-person voting. One mitigation is to give voters fake voting credentials that they can yield to a coercer. Fake credentials appear identical to real ones, but cast votes that are silently omitted from the final tally. An important unanswered question is how ordinary voters perceive such a mitigation: whether they could understand and use fake credentials, and whether the coercion risks justify the costs of mitigation. We present the first systematic study of these questions, involving 150 diverse individuals in Boston, Massachusetts. All participants "registered" and "voted" in a mock election: 120 were exposed to coercion resistance via fake credentials, the rest forming a control group. Of the 120 participants exposed to fake credentials, 96% understood their use. 53% reported that they would create fake credentials in a real-world voting scenario, given the opportunity. 10% mistakenly voted with a fake credential, however. 22% reported either personal experience with or direct knowledge of coercion or vote-buying incidents. These latter participants rated the coercion-resistant system essentially as trustworthy as in-person voting via hand-marked paper ballots. Of the 150 total participants to use the system, 87% successfully created their credentials without assistance; 83% both successfully created and properly used their credentials. Participants give a System Usability Scale score of 70.4, which is slightly above the industry's average score of 68. Our findings appear to support the importance of the coercion problem in general, and the promise of fake credentials as a possible mitigation, but user error rates remain an important usability challenge for future work.</description>

      <title>Concept Induction: Analyzing Unstructured Text with High-Level Concepts Using LLooM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data analysts have long sought to turn unstructured text data into meaningful concepts. Though common, topic modeling and clustering focus on lower-level keywords and require significant interpretative work. We introduce concept induction, a computational process that instead produces high-level concepts, defined by explicit inclusion criteria, from unstructured text. For a dataset of toxic online comments, where a state-of-the-art BERTopic model outputs "women, power, female," concept induction produces high-level concepts such as "Criticism of traditional gender roles" and "Dismissal of women's concerns." We present LLooM, a concept induction algorithm that leverages large language models to iteratively synthesize sampled text and propose human-interpretable concepts of increasing generality. We then instantiate LLooM in a mixed-initiative text analysis tool, enabling analysts to shift their attention from interpreting topics to engaging in theory-driven analysis. Through technical evaluations and four analysis scenarios ranging from literature review to content moderation, we find that LLooM's concepts improve upon the prior art of topic models in terms of quality and data coverage. In expert case studies, LLooM helped researchers to uncover new insights even from familiar datasets, for example by suggesting a previously unnoticed concept of attacks on out-party stances in a political social media dataset.</description>

      <title>Who Validates the Validators? Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations of code-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs. Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation. We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements. Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades. A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria. What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs. We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</description>

      <title>Incremental Bootstrapping and Classification of Structured Scenes in a Fuzzy Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We foresee robots that bootstrap knowledge representations and use them for classifying relevant situations and making decisions based on future observations. Particularly for assistive robots, the bootstrapping mechanism might be supervised by humans who should not repeat a training phase several times and should be able to refine the taught representation. We consider robots that bootstrap structured representations to classify some intelligible categories. Such a structure should be incrementally bootstrapped, i.e., without invalidating the identified category models when a new additional category is considered. To tackle this scenario, we presented the Scene Identification and Tagging (SIT) algorithm, which bootstraps structured knowledge representation in a crisp OWL-DL ontology. Over time, SIT bootstraps a graph representing scenes, sub-scenes and similar scenes. Then, SIT can classify new scenes within the bootstrapped graph through logic-based reasoning. However, SIT has issues with sensory data because its crisp implementation is not robust to perception noises. This paper presents a reformulation of SIT within the fuzzy domain, which exploits a fuzzy DL ontology to overcome the robustness issues. By comparing the performances of fuzzy and crisp implementations of SIT, we show that fuzzy SIT is robust, preserves the properties of its crisp formulation, and enhances the bootstrapped representations. On the contrary, the fuzzy implementation of SIT leads to less intelligible knowledge representations than the one bootstrapped in the crisp domain.</description>

      <title>Establishing a Baseline for Gaze-driven Authentication Performance in VR: A Breadth-First Investigation on a Very Large Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper performs the crucial work of establishing a baseline for gaze-driven authentication performance to begin answering fundamental research questions using a very large dataset of gaze recordings from 9202 people with a level of eye tracking (ET) signal quality equivalent to modern consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) platforms. The size of the employed dataset is at least an order-of-magnitude larger than any other dataset from previous related work. Binocular estimates of the optical and visual axes of the eyes and a minimum duration for enrollment and verification are required for our model to achieve a false rejection rate (FRR) of below 3% at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1 in 50,000. In terms of identification accuracy which decreases with gallery size, we estimate that our model would fall below chance-level accuracy for gallery sizes of 148,000 or more. Our major findings indicate that gaze authentication can be as accurate as required by the FIDO standard when driven by a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture and a sufficiently large training dataset.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shared Automated Electric Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>DimVis: Interpreting Visual Clusters in Dimensionality Reduction With Explainable Boosting Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular for transforming complex datasets into simpler visual representations. However, while effective in uncovering general dataset patterns, these methods may introduce artifacts and suffer from interpretability issues. This paper presents DimVis, a visualization tool that employs supervised Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models (trained on user-selected data of interest) as an interpretation assistant for DR projections. Our tool facilitates high-dimensional data analysis by providing an interpretation of feature relevance in visual clusters through interactive exploration of UMAP projections. Specifically, DimVis uses a contrastive EBM model that is trained in real time to differentiate between the data inside and outside a cluster of interest. Taking advantage of the inherent explainable nature of the EBM, we then use this model to interpret the cluster itself via single and pairwise feature comparisons in a ranking based on the EBM model's feature importance. The applicability and effectiveness of DimVis are demonstrated via a use case and a usage scenario with real-world data. We also discuss the limitations and potential directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: Visualization for explainable and trustworthy machine learning remains one of the most important and heavily researched fields within information visualization and visual analytics with various application domains, such as medicine, finance, and bioinformatics. After our 2020 state-of-the-art report comprising 200 techniques, we have persistently collected peer-reviewed articles describing visualization techniques, categorized them based on the previously established categorization schema consisting of 119 categories, and provided the resulting collection of 542 techniques in an online survey browser. In this survey article, we present the updated findings of new analyses of this dataset as of fall 2023 and discuss trends, insights, and eight open challenges for using visualizations in machine learning. Our results corroborate the rapidly growing trend of visualization techniques for increasing trust in machine learning models in the past three years, with visualization found to help improve popular model explainability methods and check new deep learning architectures, for instance.</description>

      <title>Negotiating the Shared Agency between Humans &amp; AI in the Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart recommendation algorithms have revolutionized information dissemination, enhancing efficiency and reshaping content delivery across various domains. However, concerns about user agency have arisen due to the inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and the nature of one-way output (power asymmetry) on algorithms. While both issues have been criticized by scholars via advocating explainable AI (XAI) and human-AI collaborative decision-making (HACD), few research evaluates their integrated effects on users, and few HACD discussions in recommender systems beyond improving and filtering the results. This study proposes an incubating idea as a missing step in HACD that allows users to control the degrees of AI-recommended content. Then, we integrate it with existing XAI to a flow prototype aimed at assessing the enhancement of user agency. We seek to understand how types of agency impact user perception and experience, and bring empirical evidence to refine the guidelines and designs for human-AI interactive systems.</description>

      <title>Open vocabulary keyword spotting through transfer learning from speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying keywords in an open-vocabulary context is crucial for personalizing interactions with smart devices. Previous approaches to open vocabulary keyword spotting dependon a shared embedding space created by audio and text encoders. However, these approaches suffer from heterogeneous modality representations (i.e., audio-text mismatch). To address this issue, our proposed framework leverages knowledge acquired from a pre-trained text-to-speech (TTS) system. This knowledge transfer allows for the incorporation of awareness of audio projections into the text representations derived from the text encoder. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with various baseline methods across four different datasets. The robustness of our proposed model is evaluated by assessing its performance across different word lengths and in an Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) scenario. Additionally, the effectiveness of transfer learning from the TTS system is investigated by analyzing its different intermediate representations. The experimental results indicate that, in the challenging LibriPhrase Hard dataset, the proposed approach outperformed the cross-modality correspondence detector (CMCD) method by a significant improvement of 8.22% in area under the curve (AUC) and 12.56% in equal error rate (EER).</description>

      <title>t-viSNE: Interactive Assessment and Interpretation of t-SNE Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.06910v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of multidimensional data has proven to be a popular approach, with successful applications in a wide range of domains. Despite their usefulness, t-SNE projections can be hard to interpret or even misleading, which hurts the trustworthiness of the results. Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task, especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this work, we present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent, accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets. Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness was evaluated. By bringing to light information that would normally be lost after running t-SNE, we hope to support analysts in using t-SNE and making its results better understandable.</description>

      <title>VisEvol: Visual Analytics to Support Hyperparameter Search through Evolutionary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.01205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the training phase of machine learning (ML) models, it is usually necessary to configure several hyperparameters. This process is computationally intensive and requires an extensive search to infer the best hyperparameter set for the given problem. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that most ML models are complex internally, and training involves trial-and-error processes that could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, each hyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others, and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaining hyperparameters. Evolutionary optimization is a promising method to try and address those issues. According to this method, performant models are stored, while the remainder are improved through crossover and mutation processes inspired by genetic algorithms. We present VisEvol, a visual analytics tool that supports interactive exploration of hyperparameters and intervention in this evolutionary procedure. In summary, our proposed tool helps the user to generate new models through evolution and eventually explore powerful hyperparameter combinations in diverse regions of the extensive hyperparameter space. The outcome is a voting ensemble (with equal rights) that boosts the final predictive performance. The utility and applicability of VisEvol are demonstrated with two use cases and interviews with ML experts who evaluated the effectiveness of the tool.</description>

      <title>FeatureEnVi: Visual Analytics for Feature Engineering Using Stepwise Selection and Semi-Automatic Extraction Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.14539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps, from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results, with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales. FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques; furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of our system.</description>

      <title>VisRuler: Visual Analytics for Extracting Decision Rules from Bagged and Boosted Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00334v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble methods in machine learning (ML) that produce many individual decision trees. Due to the inherent ensemble characteristic of these methods, they typically outperform single decision trees or other ML models in predictive performance. However, numerous decision paths are generated for each decision tree, increasing the overall complexity of the model and hindering its use in domains that require trustworthy and explainable decisions, such as finance, social care, and health care. Thus, the interpretability of bagging and boosting algorithms, such as random forest and adaptive boosting, reduces as the number of decisions rises. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics tool that aims to assist users in extracting decisions from such ML models via a thorough visual inspection workflow that includes selecting a set of robust and diverse models (originating from different ensemble learning algorithms), choosing important features according to their global contribution, and deciding which decisions are essential for global explanation (or locally, for specific cases). The outcome is a final decision based on the class agreement of several models and the explored manual decisions exported by users. We evaluated the applicability and effectiveness of VisRuler via a use case, a usage scenario, and a user study. The evaluation revealed that most users managed to successfully use our system to explore decision rules visually, performing the proposed tasks and answering the given questions in a satisfying way.</description>

      <title>HardVis: Visual Analytics to Handle Instance Hardness Using Undersampling and Oversampling Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous advances in machine learning (ML), training with imbalanced data still poses challenges in many real-world applications. Among a series of diverse techniques to solve this problem, sampling algorithms are regarded as an efficient solution. However, the problem is more fundamental, with many works emphasizing the importance of instance hardness. This issue refers to the significance of managing unsafe or potentially noisy instances that are more likely to be misclassified and serve as the root cause of poor classification performance. This paper introduces HardVis, a visual analytics system designed to handle instance hardness mainly in imbalanced classification scenarios. Our proposed system assists users in visually comparing different distributions of data types, selecting types of instances based on local characteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, and validating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques are beneficial for the ML model. Additionally, rather than uniformly undersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sample easy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users can explore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all those parameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model's predictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is a well-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. The efficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypothetical usage scenario and a use case. Finally, we also look at how useful our system is based on feedback we received from ML experts.</description>

      <title>MetaStackVis: Visually-Assisted Performance Evaluation of Metamodels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacking (or stacked generalization) is an ensemble learning method with one main distinctiveness from the rest: even though several base models are trained on the original data set, their predictions are further used as input data for one or more metamodels arranged in at least one extra layer. Composing a stack of models can produce high-performance outcomes, but it usually involves a trial-and-error process. Therefore, our previously developed visual analytics system, StackGenVis, was mainly designed to assist users in choosing a set of top-performing and diverse models by measuring their predictive performance. However, it only employs a single logistic regression metamodel. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the performance of stacking ensembles using a novel visualization tool, called MetaStackVis. Our interactive tool helps users to visually explore different singular and pairs of metamodels according to their predictive probabilities and multiple validation metrics, as well as their ability to predict specific problematic data instances. MetaStackVis was evaluated with a usage scenario based on a medical data set and via expert interviews.</description>

      <title>The State of the Art in Enhancing Trust in Machine Learning Models with the Use of Visualizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are nowadays used in complex applications in various domains, such as medicine, bioinformatics, and other sciences. Due to their black box nature, however, it may sometimes be hard to understand and trust the results they provide. This has increased the demand for reliable visualization tools related to enhancing trust in ML models, which has become a prominent topic of research in the visualization community over the past decades. To provide an overview and present the frontiers of current research on the topic, we present a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) on enhancing trust in ML models with the use of interactive visualization. We define and describe the background of the topic, introduce a categorization for visualization techniques that aim to accomplish this goal, and discuss insights and opportunities for future research directions. Among our contributions is a categorization of trust against different facets of interactive ML, expanded and improved from previous research. Our results are investigated from different analytical perspectives: (a) providing a statistical overview, (b) summarizing key findings, (c) performing topic analyses, and (d) exploring the data sets used in the individual papers, all with the support of an interactive web-based survey browser. We intend this survey to be beneficial for visualization researchers whose interests involve making ML models more trustworthy, as well as researchers and practitioners from other disciplines in their search for effective visualization techniques suitable for solving their tasks with confidence and conveying meaning to their data.</description>

      <title>DeforestVis: Behavior Analysis of Machine Learning Models with Surrogate Decision Stumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the complexity of machine learning (ML) models increases and their application in different (and critical) domains grows, there is a strong demand for more interpretable and trustworthy ML. A direct, model-agnostic, way to interpret such models is to train surrogate models-such as rule sets and decision trees-that sufficiently approximate the original ones while being simpler and easier-to-explain. Yet, rule sets can become very lengthy, with many if-else statements, and decision tree depth grows rapidly when accurately emulating complex ML models. In such cases, both approaches can fail to meet their core goal-providing users with model interpretability. To tackle this, we propose DeforestVis, a visual analytics tool that offers summarization of the behaviour of complex ML models by providing surrogate decision stumps (one-level decision trees) generated with the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) technique. DeforestVis helps users to explore the complexity versus fidelity trade-off by incrementally generating more stumps, creating attribute-based explanations with weighted stumps to justify decision making, and analysing the impact of rule overriding on training instance allocation between one or more stumps. An independent test set allows users to monitor the effectiveness of manual rule changes and form hypotheses based on case-by-case analyses. We show the applicability and usefulness of DeforestVis with two use cases and expert interviews with data analysts and model developers.</description>

      <title>Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI transparency is a central pillar of responsible AI deployment and effective human-AI collaboration. A critical approach is communicating uncertainty, such as displaying AI's confidence level, or its correctness likelihood (CL), to users. However, these confidence levels are often uncalibrated, either overestimating or underestimating actual CL, posing risks and harms to human-AI collaboration. This study examines the effects of uncalibrated AI confidence on users' trust in AI, AI advice adoption, and collaboration outcomes. We further examined the impact of increased transparency, achieved through trust calibration support, on these outcomes. Our results reveal that uncalibrated AI confidence leads to both the misuse of overconfident AI and disuse of unconfident AI, thereby hindering outcomes of human-AI collaboration. Deficiency of trust calibration support exacerbates this issue by making it harder to detect uncalibrated confidence, promoting misuse and disuse of AI. Conversely, trust calibration support aids in recognizing uncalibration and reducing misuse, but it also fosters distrust and causes disuse of AI. Our findings highlight the importance of AI confidence calibration for enhancing human-AI collaboration and suggest directions for AI design and regulation.</description>
