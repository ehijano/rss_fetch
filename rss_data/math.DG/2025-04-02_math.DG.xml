      <title>Flow Matching on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is a recent generative modelling technique: we aim to learn how to sample from distribution $\mathfrak{X}_1$ by flowing samples from some distribution $\mathfrak{X}_0$ that is easy to sample from. The key trick is that this flow field can be trained while conditioning on the end point in $\mathfrak{X}_1$: given an end point, simply move along a straight line segment to the end point (Lipman et al. 2022). However, straight line segments are only well-defined on Euclidean space. Consequently, Chen and Lipman (2023) generalised the method to FM on Riemannian manifolds, replacing line segments with geodesics or their spectral approximations. We take an alternative point of view: we generalise to FM on Lie groups by instead substituting exponential curves for line segments. This leads to a simple, intrinsic, and fast implementation for many matrix Lie groups, since the required Lie group operations (products, inverses, exponentials, logarithms) are simply given by the corresponding matrix operations. FM on Lie groups could then be used for generative modelling with data consisting of sets of features (in $\mathbb{R}^n$) and poses (in some Lie group), e.g. the latent codes of Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>Timelike Meridian Surfaces of Elliptic type in the Minkowski 4-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a special family of 2-dimensional timelike surfaces in the Minkowski 4-space $\mathbb{R}^4_1$ which lie on rotational hypersurfaces with timelike axis and call them meridian surfaces of elliptic type. We study the following basic classes of timelike meridian surfaces of elliptic type: with constant Gauss curvature, with constant mean curvature, with parallel mean curvature vector field, with parallel normalized mean curvature vector field. The results obtained for the last class are used to give explicit solutions to the background systems of natural PDEs describing the timelike surfaces with parallel normalized mean curvature vector field in $\mathbb{R}^4_1$.</description>

      <title>Orientation Scores should be a Piece of Cake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints from a symplectic point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints from a symplectic perspective. Under a transversality assumption, there is a unique control law making the trajectories of the associated closed-loop system satisfy the virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints. We characterize them in terms of the symplectic structure on $TQ$ induced by a Lagrangian function and the almost-tangent structure. In particular, we show that the closed-loop vector field satisfies a geometric equation of Chetaev type. Moreover, the closed-loop dynamics is obtained as the projection of the uncontrolled dynamics to the tangent bundle of the constraint submanifold defined by the virtual constraints.</description>

      <title>Exotic embedded surfaces and involutions from Real Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Real Seiberg--Witten theory, Miyazawa introduced an invariant of certain 4-manifolds with involution and used this invariant to construct infinitely many exotic involutions on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and infinitely many exotic smooth embeddings of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ in $S^4$. In this paper we extend Miyazawa's construction to a large class of 4-manifolds, giving many infinite families of involutions on 4-manifolds which are conjugate by homeomorphisms but not by diffeomorphisms and many infinite families of exotic embeddings of non-orientable surfaces in 4-manifolds, where exotic means continuously isotopic but not smoothly isotopic. Exoticness of our construction is detected using Real Seiberg--Witten theory. We study Miyazawa's invariant, relate it to the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants of Tian--Wang and prove various fundamental results concerning the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants such as: relation to positive scalar curvature, wall-crossing, a mod 2 formula for spin structures, a localisation formula relating ordinary and Real Seiberg--Witten invariants, a connected sum formula and a fibre sum formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of different numerical schemes in approximating Pontryagin's Maximum Principle's necessary conditions for the optimal control of nonholonomic systems. Retraction maps are used as a seed to construct geometric integrators for the corresponding Hamilton equations. First, we obtain an intrinsic formulation of a discretization map on a distribution $\mathcal{D}$. Then, we illustrate this construction on a particular example for which the performance of different symplectic integrators is examined and compared with that of non-symplectic integrators.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models: Complexity, Dimensionality, and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative networks have shown remarkable success in learning complex data distributions, particularly in generating high-dimensional data from lower-dimensional inputs. While this capability is well-documented empirically, its theoretical underpinning remains unclear. One common theoretical explanation appeals to the widely accepted manifold hypothesis, which suggests that many real-world datasets, such as images and signals, often possess intrinsic low-dimensional geometric structures. Under this manifold hypothesis, it is widely believed that to approximate a distribution on a $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the latent dimension needs to be at least $d$ or $d+1$. In this work, we show that this requirement on the latent dimension is not necessary by demonstrating that generative networks can approximate distributions on $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds from inputs of any arbitrary dimension, even lower than $d$, taking inspiration from the concept of space-filling curves. This approach, in turn, leads to a super-exponential complexity bound of the deep neural networks through expanded neurons. Our findings thus challenge the conventional belief on the relationship between input dimensionality and the ability of generative networks to model data distributions. This novel insight not only corroborates the practical effectiveness of generative networks in handling complex data structures, but also underscores a critical trade-off between approximation error, dimensionality, and model complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss nonholonomic contact Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems, that is, systems with a kind of dissipation that are also subject to nonholonomic constraints. We introduce the so-called contact Eden bracket that allows us to obtain the evolution of any observable. Finally, we present a particular vector subspace of observables where the dynamics remain unconstrained.</description>

Abstract: Let (M,g) be a 2-quasi-Einstein non-conformally flat semi-Riemannian manifold of dimension &gt; 3. We prove that if its Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor R is a linear combination of some Kulkarni-Nomizu tensors formed by the metric tensor g, the Ricci tensor S and its square S^2, then some pseudosymmetry type curvature conditions are satisfied. Certain non-conformally flat warped product manifolds with 2-dimensional base, and in particular some spacetimes, are such 2-quasi Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>On a natural L2 metric on the space of Hermitian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of Hermitian metrics on a fixed complex vector bundle. This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of Hermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is introduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to this metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though being geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically incomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2 integrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and its completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths seminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always L2 integrable in our sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is used to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a given fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism, provided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic rigidity of extremal horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of any vacuum extremal horizon must admit a Killing vector field. If the cross-sections are two-dimensional spheres, this implies that the most general solution is the extremal Kerr horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant. Furthermore, we also deduce that any non-trivial vacuum near-horizon geometry, with a non-positive cosmological constant, must have a Lie algebra of Killing vector fields that contains $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\times \mathfrak{u}(1)$ in all dimensions under no symmetry assumptions. We also show that, if the cross-sections are two-dimensional, the horizon Einstein equation is equivalent to a single fourth order PDE for the K\"ahler potential, and that this equation is explicitly solvable on the sphere if the corresponding metric admits a Killing vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a general Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem by using the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence picture and Berndtsson's theorem in \cite{Bern20}. In the test configuration ($\mathbb C^*$-degeneration) case, our approach gives a quick proof of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem without taking limit or using singular weight, which is very different from the Ohsawa-Chen-Blocki-Guan-Zhou approach and the Berndtsson-Lempert approach. Another advantage of our approach is that it fits better to the sharp estimate for the weighted Bergman kernel on compact manifold. In particular, our approach gives a sharp lower bound of the Bergman kernel for compact Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a $k$-punctured, $k \geq 0$, closed connected orientable surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the character variety of the $(Q^+, Q^-)$-Anosov irreducible representations, resp. the character variety of the $(P^+, P^-)$-Anosov Zariski dense representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n , \C)$, $n \geq 2$, is a complex manifold of complex dimension \hbox{$(2g+k-2)(n^2-1)$}. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove the Riemannian analog of black hole mode stability for Hermitian, non-self-dual gravitational instantons which are either asymptotically locally flat (ALF) and Ricci-flat, or compact and Einstein with positive cosmological constant. We show that the Teukolsky equation on any such manifold is a positive definite operator. We also discuss the compatibility of the results with the existence of negative modes associated to variational instabilities.</description>
