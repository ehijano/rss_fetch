      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for MIMO with Quantized b-bit Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for 6G communication, offering improved spectral efficiency and reliability. However, conventional fully digital designs face significant challenges due to high hardware complexity and power consumption. Low-bit MIMO architectures, such as those employing b-bit quantized phase shifters, provide a cost-effective alternative but introduce NP-hard combinatorial problems in the pre- and post-coding design. This paper explores the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and alternating optimization to address the problem of b-bit quantized phase shifters both at the transmitter and the receiver. We demonstrate that the structure of this quantized beamforming problem aligns naturally with hybrid-classical methods like QAOA, as the phase shifts used in beamforming can be directly mapped to rotation gates in a quantum circuit. Notably, this paper is the first to show that theoretical connection. Then, the Hamiltonian derivation analysis for the b-bit case is presented, which could have applications in different fields, such as integrated sensing and communication, and emerging quantum algorithms such as quantum machine learning. In addition, a warm-start QAOA approach is studied which improves computational efficiency. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving an improved quantized beamforming gain over their classical optimization benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Navigate in Demanding Missions: Integrating Human Intelligence and Brain-Inspired Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective analyzes the intricate interplay among neuroscience, Brain-Inspired Intelligence (BII), and Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN), revealing a current lack of cooperative relationship between Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and BIN fields. We advocate for the integration of neuromorphic-empowered BCI into BIN, thereby bolstering the unmanned systems' reliable navigation in demanding missions, such as deep space exploration, etc. We highlight that machine intelligence, reinforced by brain-inspired artificial consciousness, can extend human intelligence, with human intelligence mediated by neuromorphic-enabled BCI acting as a safeguard in case machine intelligence failures. This study also discusses the potentials of the proposed approach to enhance unmanned systems' capabilities and facilitate the diagnostics of spatial cognition disorders, while considering associated ethical and security concerns.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synthetic Data Generation for Industrial Bioprocess Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity and sparsity in bio-manufacturing poses challenges for accurate model
  development, process monitoring, and optimization. We aim to replicate and capture
  the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a Quantum
  Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) to
  generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The
  generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). This
  methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling,
  forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management by
  reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate
  acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess data.
  We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation. The data
  generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data. This
  intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new frontiers in
  data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive fields, for
  use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or for use
  in predictive control.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges for 3D Systems and Their Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although it is not a new concept, 3D integration increasingly receives widespread interest and focus as lithographic scaling becomes more challenging, and as the ability to make miniature vias greatly improves. Like Moores law, 3D integration improves density. With improvements in packaging density, however, come the challenges associated with its inherently higher power density. And though it acts somewhat as a scaling accelerator, the vertical integration also poses new challenges to design and manufacturing technologies. The placement of circuits, vias, and macros in the planes of a 3D stack must be co-designed across layers (or must conform to new standards) so that, when assembled, they have correct spatial correspondence. Each layer, although perhaps being a mere functional slice through a system (and we can slice the system in many different ways), must be independently testable so that we can systematically test and diagnose subsystems before and after final assembly. When those layers are assembled, they must come together in a way that enables a sensible yield and facilitates testing the finished product. To make the most of 3D integration, we should articulate the leverages of 3D systems (other researchers offer a more complete treatment elsewhere). Then we can enumerate and elucidate many of the new challenges posed by the design, assembly, and test of 3D systems.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Verification Framework for Configurable IPs: From Requirements to Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing competition in the semiconductor industry has created significant pressure to reduce chip prices while maintaining quality and reliability. Functional verification, particularly for configurable IPs, is a major contributor to development costs due to its complexity and resource-intensive nature. To address this, we propose a fully automated framework for requirements driven functional verification. The framework automates key processes, including vPlan generation, testbench creation, regression execution, and reporting in a requirements management tool, drastically reducing verification effort. This approach accelerates development cycles, minimizes human error, and enhances coverage, offering a scalable and efficient solution to the challenges of verifying configurable IPs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Citiverses for Regulatory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning, grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation, ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas. The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and regulatory sandboxes</description>

      <title>Meta-Guardian: An Early Evaluation of an On-device Application to Mitigate Psychography Data Leakage in Immersive Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Immersive Technologies has shown its potential to revolutionize many sectors such as health, entertainment, education, and industrial sectors. Immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) have redefined user interaction through real-time biometric and behavioral tracking. Although Immersive Technologies (XR) essentially need the collection of the biometric data which acts as a baseline to create immersive experience, however, this ongoing feedback information (includes biometrics) poses critical privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data collected. A comprehensive review of recent literature explored the technical dimensions of related problem; however, they largely overlook the challenge particularly the intricacies of real-time biometric data filtering within head-mounted display system. Motivated from this, in this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving system architecture that identifies and filters biometric signals (within the VR headset) in real-time before transmission or storage. Implemented as a modular Unity Software-development Kit (SDK) compatible with major immersive platforms, our solution (named Meta-Guardian) employs machine learning models for signal classification and a filtering mechanism to block sensitive data. This framework aims to enable developers to embed privacy-by-design principles into immersive experiences on various headsets and applications.</description>

      <title>QRTlib: A Library for Fast Quantum Real Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-valued transforms such as the discrete cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms play a central role in classical computing, complementing the Fourier transform in applications from signal and image processing to data compression. However, their quantum counterparts have not evolved in parallel, and no unified framework exists for implementing them efficiently on quantum hardware. This article addresses this gap by introducing QRTlib, a library for fast and practical implementations of quantum real transforms, including the quantum Hartley, cosine, and sine transforms of various types. We develop new algorithms and circuit optimizations that make these transforms efficient and suitable for near-term devices. In particular, we present a quantum Hartley transform based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) technique, achieving a fourfold reduction in circuit size compared to prior methods, and an improved quantum sine transform of Type I that removes large multi-controlled operations. We also introduce circuit-level optimizations, including two's-complement and or-tree constructions. QRTlib provides the first complete implementations of these quantum real transforms in Qiskit.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-Inspired Exploration of RL-based LLMs and Synergy with Wireless Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have attracted widespread attention for their remarkable capabilities in multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</description>
