      <title>MODEL&amp;CO: Exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging by learning across multiple observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is particularly challenging due to the high contrast between the planet and the star luminosities, and their small angular separation. In addition to tailored instrumental facilities implementing adaptive optics and coronagraphy, post-processing methods combining several images recorded in pupil tracking mode are needed to attenuate the nuisances corrupting the signals of interest. Most of these post-processing methods build a model of the nuisances from the target observations themselves, resulting in strongly limited detection sensitivity at short angular separations due to the lack of angular diversity. To address this issue, we propose to build the nuisance model from an archive of multiple observations by leveraging supervised deep learning techniques. The proposed approach casts the detection problem as a reconstruction task and captures the structure of the nuisance from two complementary representations of the data. Unlike methods inspired by reference differential imaging, the proposed model is highly non-linear and does not resort to explicit image-to-image similarity measurements and subtractions. The proposed approach also encompasses statistical modeling of learnable spatial features. The latter is beneficial to improve both the detection sensitivity and the robustness against heterogeneous data. We apply the proposed algorithm to several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, and demonstrate a superior precision-recall trade-off compared to the PACO algorithm. Interestingly, the gain is especially important when the diversity induced by ADI is the most limited, thus supporting the ability of the proposed approach to learn information across multiple observations.</description>

      <title>How Do Observational Astronomers Learn to Inspect Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of data collection. Upcoming large surveys will gather more data than ever before, generated at rates requiring real-time decision making. Looking ahead, it is inevitable that astronomers will need to rely more heavily on automated processes. Indeed, some instances have already arisen wherein the majority of the inspection process is automated. Visual discovery, performed traditionally by humans, is one key area where automation is now being integrated rapidly. Visual discovery comprises two aspects: (1) visual inspection, the skill associated with examining an image to identify areas or objects of interest; and (2) visual interpretation, the knowledge associated with the classification of the objects or features. Both skills and knowledge are vital for humans to perform visual discovery, however, there appears to have been limited investigation into how the skill of visual inspection in astronomy is acquired. We report on a survey of 70 professional observational astronomers, at various career stages and from different geographical regions. We found that between 63% and 73% of the astronomers surveyed had received formal and$/$or informal training in visual inspection of images, although formal training (21%) was less common than informal training (60%). Surprisingly, out of the 37% who did not recall having received training in visual inspection, 29% (20 astronomers) indicated that they provided training to others. This suggests the emergence of `expertise without precedent' where a first expert in the field provides a new way of achieving a task. These results, paired with a set of three pilot interviews, present a touchstone against which the training of future observational astronomers can be compared.</description>

      <title>Black hole ring images from PSF structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two critical aspects of radio interferometric imaging analysis are data calibration and deconvolution of the point spread function (PSF) structure. Both of these are particularly important for high-frequency observations using a VLBI network consisting of a small number of stations, such as those conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) has presented images of ring-shaped black holes from observations of M 87 (d = 42 +- 3 muas)(EHTC2019a) and the Galactic Center (d = 51.8 +- 2.3 muas)(EHTC2022a). The ring structures seen in the EHTC images are consistent with the estimated shadow diameter of the black hole based on its mass and distance. However, these black hole ring sizes are also the same with the typical up and down spacings (e.g., the intervals between the main beam and nearby 1st-sidelobes) seen in the point spread function (PSF; dirty beam) for each observation. These facts suggest that the EHTC ring structures are artifacts derived from the shape of the PSFs rather than the intrinsic structure of the SMBHs in M 87 and the Galactic Center.
  The EHTC utilizes novel imaging techniques in addition to the standard CLEAN algorithm. The CLEAN method was designed for PSF shape deconvolution in mind, yet in practice, it may not always be able to completely remove the PSF shape. In the imaging analysis of data from interferometers with a small number of antennas like the EHT, it is crucial to assess the PSF shape and compare it with the imaging results. The novel imaging methods employed by the EHTC have not yet been fully evaluated for PSF deconvolution performance, and it is highly recommended that their performance in this regard be thoroughly examined. It is also important to investigate the data calibration capability, i.e., the ability to separate error noise from the observed data.</description>

      <title>CARRSSPipeline: Flux Calibration and Non-linear Reprojection for SALT-RSS Multi-Object Spectroscopy over 3500-9500 {\AA}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) offers multi-object spectroscopy over an 8' field-of-view at resolutions up to 3000. Reduction is typically conducted using RSSMOSPipeline, which performs basic data calibrations, sky subtraction, and wavelength calibration. However, flux calibration of SALT-RSS using spectrophotometric standard star observations is difficult due to variable primary mirror illumination. We describe a novel approach where stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra are included as alignment stars on RSS slitmasks and then used to perform flux calibration of the resulting data. RSS offers multiple settings that can be pieced together to cover the entire optical range, utilizing grating angle dithers to fill chip gaps. We introduce a non-linear reprojection routine that defines an exponential wavelength array spanning 3500-9500 Angstroms with gradually decreasing resolution and then reprojects several individual settings into a single 2D spectrum for each object. Our flux calibration and non-linear reprojection routines are released as part of the Calibration And Reprojection for RSS Pipeline (CARRSSPipeline; https://github.com/GeorgeTheGeorgian/CARRSSPipeline.git ), that enables the extraction of full-optical-coverage, flux-calibrated, medium-resolution one-dimensional spectra.</description>

      <title>Computational forms for binary particle interactions at different levels of anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle interactions are key elements of many dynamical systems. In the context of systems described by a Boltzmann equation, such interactions may be described by a collision integral, a multidimensional integral over the momentum-phase space of the interaction. This integral is often simplified by assuming isotropic particle distributions; however, such an assumption places constraints on the dynamics of the system. This paper presents computational forms of the collision integral for relativistic, binary interactions at three levels of anisotropy, including a novel form in the isotropic case. All these forms are split into two parts, an absorption and an emission spectrum, which may be pre-calculated via numerical integration for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of these forms by comparison with the analytically integrated, isotropic emission spectrum of electron-positron annihilation, which are shown to agree to numerical precision. The emission spectrum is then further extended to axisymmetric particle distributions, where two-dimensional spectral maps can be generated to provide new insight.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: deep spectral line observations of the COSMOS field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIGHTEE survey utilises the South African MeerKAT radio telescope to observe four extragalactic deep fields, with the aim of advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. MIGHTEE's frequency coverage encompasses the $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ line to a redshift of z $\simeq$ 0.58, and OH megamasers to z $\simeq$ 0.9. We present the MIGHTEE-$\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ imaging products for the COSMOS field, using a total of 94.2 h on-target and a close-packed mosaic of 15 individual pointings. The spectral imaging covers two broad, relatively interference-free regions (960-1150 and 1290-1520~MHz) within MeerKAT's L-band, with up to 26 kHz spectral resolution (5.5 km s$^{-1}$ at $z$ = 0). The median noise in the highest spectral resolution data is 74 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 5$\sigma$ $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ mass limit of 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ for a 300 km s$^{-1}$ line at $z$ = 0.07. The mosaics cover $&gt;$4 deg$^{2}$, provided at multiple angular resolution / sensitivity pairings, with an angular resolution for $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ at $z$ = 0 of 12$''$. We describe the spectral line processing workflow that will be the basis for future MIGHTEE-$\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ products, and validation of, and some early results from, the spectral imaging of the COSMOS field. We find no evidence for line emission at the position of the $z$ = 0.376 \HI~line reported from the CHILES survey at a $&gt;$94 per cent confidence level, placing a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 8.1 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ on $M_{\mathrm{HI}}$ for this galaxy. A public data release accompanies this article.</description>

      <title>Advanced Classification of Hot Subdwarf Binaries Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Gaia DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs are compact blue evolved objects, burning helium in their cores surrounded by a tiny hydrogen envelope. Most models agree on a common envelope binary evolution scenario in the Red Giant phase. However, the binarity rate for these objects is yet unsolved. We aim to develop a novel classification method for identifying hot subdwarf binaries within large datasets using Artificial Intelligence methods and Gaia DR3 data. The results will be compared with those obtained previously using VOSA (Virtual Observatory Sed Analyzer) on coincident samples. The methods include several machine learning techniques. We used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify 3084 hot subdwarf stars based on their color-magnitude properties. Of these, 2815 objects have Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP spectra, which were classified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The findings demonstrate a high agreement level (70-90%) with VOSA's classification, indicating that machine learning methods effectively classify sources with an accuracy comparable to human inspection or non-AI techniques. SVM in a radial basis function achieves 70.97% reproducibility for binary targets using photometry. CNN reaches 84.94% for binary detection using spectroscopy. We also found that the single-binary differences are especially observable on the infrared flux in our GDR3 BP/BR spectra, at wavelengths larger than 700 nm. We found that all our methods are effective in discerning between single and binary systems and are consistent with the results previously obtained with VOSA. In global terms, considering all quality metrics, CNN is the method that provides the best accuracy. The methods are also effective for detecting peculiarities in the spectra. Further research is needed to refine our techniques and enhance automated classification reliability, especially for large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference Benchmark for LSST Weak Lensing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard cosmological analysis, which relies on two-point statistics, fails to extract the full information of the data. This limits our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters. Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the sbi_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highest scientific return, for adaptive optics (AO) observations, is achieved with a reliable reconstruction of the PSF. This is especially true for MICADO@ELT. In this presentation, we will focus on extending the MICADO PSF reconstruction (PSF-R) method to the off-axis case. Specifically, a novel approach based on temporal-based tomography of AO telemetry data has been recently implemented. Results from the PSF-R of both simulated and real data show that, at half isoplanatic angle distances, a precision of about 10-15% is achievable in both Strehl ratio and full-width at half maximum, paving the way to extend the MICADO PSF-R tool also to the multi-conjugated AO case.</description>

      <title>CuRIOS-ED: The Technology Demonstrator for the CubeSats for Rapid Infrared and Optical Surveys Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of time-domain astronomy including electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, gravitational microlensing, explosive phenomena, and even astrometry with Gaia, are showing the power and need for surveys with high-cadence, large area, and long time baselines to study the transient universe. A constellation of SmallSats or CubeSats providing wide, instantaneous sky coverage down to 21 Vega mag at optical wavelengths would be ideal for addressing this need. We are assembling CuRIOS-ED (CubeSats for Rapid Infrared and Optical Survey--Exploration Demo), an optical telescope payload which will act as a technology demonstrator for a larger constellation of several hundred 16U CubeSats known as CuRIOS. In preparation for CuRIOS, CuRIOS-ED will launch in late 2025 as part of the 12U Starspec InspireSat MVP payload. CuRIOS-ED will be used to demonstrate the StarSpec ADCS pointing capabilities to &lt;1" and to space-qualify a commercial camera package for use on the full CuRIOS payload. The CuRIOS-ED camera system will utilize a Sony IMX455 CMOS detector delivered in an off-the-shelf Atik apx60 package which we modified to be compatible with operations in vacuum as well as the CubeSat form factor, power, and thermal constraints. By qualifying this commercial camera solution, the cost of each CuRIOS satellite will be greatly decreased (~100x) when compared with current space-qualified cameras with IMX455 detectors. We discuss the CuRIOS-ED mission design with an emphasis on the disassembly, repackaging, and testing of the Atik apx60 for space-based missions. Characterization of the apx60's read noise, dark current, patterned noise, and thermal behavior are reported for a range of temperatures (-35 C to 40 C) and exposure times (0.001s to 30 s). Additionally, we comment on preliminary environmental testing results from a successful thermal vacuum test.</description>

      <title>Fast solution of Sylvester-structured systems for spatial source separation of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implementation of many statistical methods for large, multivariate data sets requires one to solve a linear system that, depending on the method, is of the dimension of the number of observations or each individual data vector. This is often the limiting factor in scaling the method with data size and complexity. In this paper we illustrate the use of Krylov subspace methods to address this issue in a statistical solution to a source separation problem in cosmology where the data size is prohibitively large for direct solution of the required system. Two distinct approaches, adapted from techniques in the literature, are described: one that uses the method of conjugate gradients directly to the Kronecker-structured problem and another that reformulates the system as a Sylvester matrix equation. We show that both approaches produce an accurate solution within an acceptable computation time and with practical memory requirements for the data size that is currently available.</description>

Abstract: Unresolved sources of gravitational waves can create a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) which may have intrinsic or extrinsic anisotropies. The angular power spectrum is a well-suited estimator for characterizing diffuse anisotropic distributions in the sky. Here we estimate the first model-independent all-sky all-frequency SGWB angular power spectra in the 20-1726 Hz frequency range from the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We develop a method to use the spectrum's signal-to-noise ratio as the detection statistic and show that the shape of the distribution of the statistic obtained from the data agrees with the analytical model with a modified value of the parameter. Since we find the data to be consistent with noise, $95\%$ confidence Bayesian upper limits are set on the angular power spectra, ranging from $C_\ell^{1/2}\leq(3.0\times10^{-9}-0.73)~\text{sr}^{-1}$. We also introduce a method to combine the narrow band angular power spectra to obtain estimators for broadband SGWB. These results can directly constrain theoretical models that predict the SGWB angular power spectra and for estimating or constraining the corresponding parameters. In addition, the results and the techniques introduced in this work can be useful for performing correlation-based searches, for instance, with electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Polarization Detection with Tetrahedron Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we have introduced the Tetrahedron Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory (TEGO) composed of four identical spacecrafts (S/Cs). The laser telescopes and their pointing structures are mounted on the S/C platform and are evenly distributed at three locations 120 degrees apart. These structures form automatically a stable mass center for the platform. The time delay interferometry (TDI) are used to suppress the frequency noise of Gravitational Wave (GW) detector. The unequal arm Michelson TDI configuration and the Sagnac TDI configuration are equally effective at eliminating the laser frequency noise based on the TEGO configuration. Furthermore, comparing to the configurations of LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, the TEGO has more combinations of optical paths in its TDI system sensitive to GW signals. The six arms of TEGO are simultaneously sensitive to the six polarization modes of GWs. The sensitivity implies that GW modes beyond the predictions of general relativity (GR) can be detected directly. For instance, a scalar longitudinal mode of GWs, which is not predicted by GR, has been identified as a dominant polarization component. This mode is found to be evident in the response amplitudes of the TEGO arms, such as between S/C1 and S/C4, and S/C3 and S/C4, at certain orbital positions.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-Subaru. II. Diverse Populations of Circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circumgalactic Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) nebulae are gaseous halos around galaxies exhibiting luminous extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This work investigates Ly$\alpha$ nebulae from deep imaging of $\sim12~\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky, targeted by the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey. Utilizing the wide-field capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), we present one of the largest blind Ly$\alpha$ nebula selections, including QSO nebulae, Ly$\alpha$ blobs, and radio galaxy nebulae down to typical $2\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness of $(5-10)\times10^{-18}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. The sample contains 117 nebulae with Ly$\alpha$ sizes of 40 - 400 kpc, and the most gigantic one spans about 365 kpc, referred to as the Ivory Nebula. Combining multiwavelength data, we investigate diverse nebula populations and associated galaxies. We find a small fraction of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae have QSOs ($\sim7\%$), luminous infrared galaxies ($\sim1\%$), and radio galaxies ($\sim 2\%$). Remarkably, among the 28 enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe) exceeding 100 kpc, about 80\% are associated with UV-faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{UV} &gt; -22$), categorized as Type II ELANe. We underscore that Type II ELANe constitute the majority but remain largely hidden in current galaxy and QSO surveys. Dusty starburst and obscured AGN activity are proposed to explain the nature of Type II ELANe. The SED of stacking all Ly$\alpha$ nebulae also reveals signs of massive dusty star-forming galaxies with obscured AGNs. We propose a model to explain the dusty nature where the diverse populations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae capture massive galaxies at different evolutionary stages undergoing violent assembling. Ly$\alpha$ nebulae provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of today's massive cluster galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Giant Impact Simulations with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining planet formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 $N$-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the post-collision planets, from a short integration of the system's initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an ML-based giant impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant impact simulations with reasonable accuracy and a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our training code, along with an easy-to-use API for our collision outcome model and giant impact emulator.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimal Transport-Based Approach for Interpolating Spectral Time Series: Paving the Way for Photometric Classification of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for creating spectral time series, which can be used for generating synthetic light curves for photometric classification but also for applications like K-corrections and bolometric corrections. This approach is particularly valuable in the era of large astronomical surveys, where it can significantly enhance the analysis and understanding of an increasing number of SNe, even in the absence of extensive spectroscopic data. methods: By employing interpolations based on optimal transport theory, starting from a spectroscopic sequence, we derive weighted average spectra with high cadence. The weights incorporate an uncertainty factor for penalizing interpolations between spectra that show significant epoch differences and lead to a poor match between the synthetic and observed photometry. results: Our analysis reveals that even with phase difference of up to 40 days between pairs of spectra, optical transport can generate interpolated spectral time series that closely resemble the original ones. Synthetic photometry extracted from these spectral time series aligns well with observed photometry. The best results are achieved in the V band, with relative residuals of less than 10% for 87% and 84% of the data for type Ia and II, respectively. For the B, g, R and r bands, the relative residuals are between 65% and 87% within the previously mentioned 10% threshold for both classes. The worse results correspond to the i and I bands where, in the case, of SN~Ia the values drop to 53% and 42%, respectively. conclusions: We introduce a new method for constructing spectral time series for individual SNe starting from a sparse spectroscopic sequence, and demonstrate its capability to produce reliable light curves that can be used for photometric classification.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding pulsar observations with the CVN incorporating the FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for pulsar research is becoming increasingly prominent and receiving more and more attention. In this paper, we present pathfinding pulsar observation results with the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) incorporating the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). On MJD 60045 (April 11th, 2023), PSRs B0919+06 and B1133+16 were observed with the phase-referencing mode in the L-band using four radio telescopes (FAST, TianMa, Haoping and Nanshan) and correlated with the pulsar binning mode of the distributed FX-style software correlator in Shanghai. After further data processing with the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS), we detected these two pulsars and fitted their current positions with accuracy at the milliarcsecond level. By comparison, our results show significantly better agreement with predicted values based on historical VLBI observations than that with previous timing observations, as pulsar astrometry with the VLBI provides a more direct and model-independent method for accurately obtaining related parameters.</description>
