      <title>Asymptotics of Sum of Heavy-tailed Risks with Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tail asymptotics of the sum of two heavy-tailed random variables. The dependence structure is modeled by copulas with the so-called tail order property. Examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Further for each example we apply the main results to obtain the asymptotic expansions for Value-at-Risk of aggregate risk.</description>

      <title>A Risk Sensitive Contract-unified Reinforcement Learning Approach for Option Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new risk sensitive reinforcement learning approach for the dynamic hedging of options. The approach focuses on the minimization of the tail risk of the final P&amp;L of the seller of an option. Different from most existing reinforcement learning approaches that require a parametric model of the underlying asset, our approach can learn the optimal hedging strategy directly from the historical market data without specifying a parametric model; in addition, the learned optimal hedging strategy is contract-unified, i.e., it applies to different options contracts with different initial underlying prices, strike prices, and maturities. Our approach extends existing reinforcement learning methods by learning the tail risk measures of the final hedging P&amp;L and the optimal hedging strategy at the same time. We carry out comprehensive empirical study to show that, in the out-of-sample tests, the proposed reinforcement learning hedging strategy can obtain statistically significantly lower tail risk and higher mean of the final P&amp;L than delta hedging methods.</description>

      <title>On Vulnerability Conditional Risk Measures: Comparisons and Applications in Cryptocurrency Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of systemic risk measures, the Vulnerability Conditional risk measures, which try to capture the "tail risk" of a risky position in scenarios where one or more market participants is experiencing financial distress. Various theoretical properties of Vulnerability Conditional risk measures, along with a series of related contribution measures, have been considered in this paper. We further introduce the backtesting procedures of VCoES and MCoES. Through numerical examples, we validate our theoretical insights and further apply our newly proposed risk measures to the empirical analysis of cryptocurrencies, demonstrating their practical relevance and utility in capturing systemic risk.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Solution for Asset Allocation with a Multivariate Laplace Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note the theory for multivariate asset allocation with elliptically symmetric distributions of returns, as developed in the author's prior work, is specialized to the case of returns drawn from a multivariate Laplace distribution. This analysis delivers a result closely, but not perfectly, consistent with the conjecture presented in the author's article Thinking Differently About Asset Allocation. The principal differences are due to the introduction of a term in the dimensionality of the problem, which was omitted from the conjectured solution, and a rescaling of the variance due to varying parameterizations of the univariate Laplace distribution.</description>
