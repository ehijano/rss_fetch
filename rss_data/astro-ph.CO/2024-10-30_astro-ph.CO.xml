      <title>Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}=\{b_i(r)\}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients $\{w_i\}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only $\{\Omega_{\rm m},h\}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Dynamical and Gravitational Lensing Tests in Scale Invariance: The Fall of Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first briefly review the adventure of scale invariance in physics, from Galileo Galilei, Weyl, Einstein, and Feynman to the revival by Dirac (1973) and Canuto et al. (1977). We then gather concrete observational evidence that scale-invariant effects are present and measurable in astronomical objects spanning a vast range of masses (0.5 M$_{\odot} &lt;$ M $&lt; 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) and an equally impressive range of spatial scales (0.01 pc $&lt;$ r $&lt;$ 1 Gpc). Scale invariance accounts for the observed excess in velocity in galaxy clusters with respect to the visible mass, the relatively flat/small slope of rotation curves in local galaxies, the observed steep rotation curves of high-redshift galaxies, and the excess of velocity in wide binary stars with separations above 3000 kau found in Gaia DR3. Last but not least, we investigate the effect of scale invariance on gravitational lensing. We show that scale invariance does not affect the geodesics of light rays as they pass in the vicinity of a massive galaxy. However, scale-invariant effects do change the inferred mass-to-light ratio of lens galaxies as compared to GR. As a result, the discrepancies seen in GR between the total lensing mass of galaxies and their stellar mass from photometry may be accounted for. This holds true both for lenses at high redshift like JWST-ER1 and at low redshift like in the SLACS sample. Of note is that none of the above observational tests require dark matter or any adjustable parameter to tweak the theory at any given mass or spatial scale.</description>

      <title>LIMFAST. III. Timing Cosmic Reionization with the 21 cm and Near-Infrared Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timeline of cosmic reionization remains uncertain despite sustained efforts to study how the ionizing output of early galaxies shaped the intergalactic medium (IGM). Using the semi-numerical code LIMFAST, we investigate the prospects for timing the reionization process by cross-correlating the 21 cm signal with the cosmic near-infrared background (NIRB) contributed by galaxies at $z&gt;5$. Tracing opposite phases of the IGM on large scales during reionization, the two signals together serve as a powerful probe for the reionization history. However, because long-wavelength, line-of-sight Fourier modes -- the only modes probed by NIRB fluctuations -- are contaminated by 21 cm foregrounds and thus inevitably lost to foreground cleaning or avoidance, a direct cross-correlation of the two signals vanishes. We show that this problem can be circumvented by squaring the foreground-filtered 21 cm signal and cross-correlating the squared field with the NIRB. This statistic is related to the 21 cm--21 cm--NIRB cross-bispectrum and encodes valuable information regarding the reionization timeline. Particularly, the 21 cm$^2$ and NIRB signals are positively correlated during the early phases of reionization and negatively correlated at later stages. We demonstrate that this behavior is generic across several different reionization models and compare our simulated results with perturbative calculations. We show that this cross-correlation can be detected at high significance by forthcoming 21 cm and NIRB surveys such as SKA and SPHEREx. Our methodology is more broadly applicable to cross-correlations between line intensity mapping data and 2D tracers of the large-scale structure, including photometric galaxy surveys and CMB lensing mass maps, among others.</description>

      <title>A revisited Correction to the Halo Mass Function for local-type Primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of primordial non-Gaussianities on halo number counts using N-body simulations with different values of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We show how current theoretical models fail to adequately describe the non-Gaussian mass function of halos identified with different overdensity thresholds, $\Delta_{\rm b}$. We explain how these discrepancies are related to a variation in the density profile of dark matter halos, finding that the internal steepness (i.e. the compactness) of halos depends on the value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We then parametrize these deviations in halo number counts with a factor $\kappa(\Delta_{\rm b})$ that modifies the linear density threshold for collapse according to the halo identification threshold used, defined with respect to the Universe background density. We rely on a second-degree polynomial to describe $\kappa$ and employ a Bayesian analysis to determine the coefficients of this polynomial. In addition, we verify the independence of the latter on the sign and absolute value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. Finally, we show how this re-parametrization prevents the extraction of biased constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, correcting for large systematic errors especially in the case of halos identified with high density thresholds. This improvement is crucial in the perspective of deriving cosmological constraints with the non-Gaussian mass function from real data, as different mass definitions can be employed depending on the properties of the survey.</description>

      <title>Towards alleviating the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with Early Dark Energy - Dark Matter drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dark energy, an additional component of dark energy active in the decade of redshift before recombination, has emerged as one of the most effective models at reducing the $H_0$ tension between direct measurement of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ in the late-universe and the $\Lambda$CDM prediction when calibrated on Planck. However, it requires a slight increase in the dark matter density $\omega_{\rm cdm}$ and primordial tilt $n_s$ that worsens the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing at low redshifts and the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM prediction. Using a phenomenological fluid model, we investigate whether the inclusion of a drag term between dark matter and early dark energy can compensate for the effect of the increase in power at small-scales, such that both $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are simultaneously alleviated. We find that this works if the drag term is dynamically relevant in the post-recombination universe. However, a drag term active before or just around the time at which the early dark energy contribution to the energy density is maximum is significantly constrained due to its impact on the matter perturbations before recombination, and the subsequent modifications to the cosmic microwave background power spectra.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric reconstruction of the fine structure constant with galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing possible variations in fundamental constants of nature is a crucial endeavor in observational cosmology. This paper investigates potential cosmological variations in the fine structure constant ($\alpha$) through a non-parametric approach, using galaxy cluster observations as the primary cosmological probe. We employ two methodologies based on galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements derived from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations, along with luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae. We also explore how different values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) impact the variation of $\alpha$ across cosmic history. When using the Planck satellite's $H_0$ observations, a constant $\alpha$ is ruled out at approximately the 3$\sigma$ confidence level for $z \lesssim 0.5$. Conversely, employing local estimates of $H_0$ restores agreement with a constant $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Covariance for Constraining Theoretical Models From Galaxy Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of covariance within uncertainties on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, specifically focusing on galaxy stellar mass functions derived from the CAMELS simulation suite. Utilizing both Fisher analysis and Implicit Likelihood Inference (ILI), we explore how different covariance structures, including simple toy models and physics-motivated uncertainties, affect posterior distributions and parameter variances. Our methodology utilizes forward modeling via emulators that are trained on CAMELS simulations to produce stellar mass functions based on input parameters, subsequently incorporating Gaussian noise as defined by covariance matrices. We examine both toy model covariance matrices and physically motivated covariance matrices derived from observational factors like the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and photometric aperture size. Our results demonstrate that covariance terms significantly influence parameter inference, often leading to tighter constraints or revealing complex, multimodal posterior distributions. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for covariance when interpreting astrophysical observations, especially in fields where accurate parameter estimation is critical for model validation and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Space Distortion constraints on neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmology dependence of baryonic feedback in weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust modeling of non-linear scales is critical for accurate cosmological inference in Stage IV surveys. For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach. Our results show that the PCA method is robust to the coupling between cosmology and baryonic feedback, whereas, when using HMCode2020 there can be up to $0.5\sigma$ bias in $\Omega_\text{m}$-$S_8$. For HMCode2020, the bias also correlates with the input cosmology while for PCA we find no such correlation.</description>

      <title>Dark Radiation production in axion misalignment mechanisms and the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark radiation (DR) from axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) as potential origins of dark matter. Focusing on the dark matter misalignment mechanism, we examine non-thermal, pre-inflationary scenarios that could lead to the generation of DR. A key part of our analysis involves a Bayesian approach to confront ALP parameter space with current cosmological data. Additionally, we explore how DR production could offer solutions to persistent cosmological anomalies, particularly those related to the Hubble constant $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ parameter discrepancy. Our findings aim to shed new light on the role of ALPs in addressing these open issues in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the D &lt; 120 Mpc Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Universe (D &lt; 120 Mpc) has been intensely studied for decades, with highly complete galaxy redshift surveys now publicly available. These data have driven density reconstructions of the underlying matter density field, as well as constrained simulations that aim to reproduce the observed structures. In this paper, we introduce a dispersion measure (DM) model that makes use of this detailed knowledge of our Local Universe within D &lt; 120 Mpc. The model comprises three key components: (i) the DM from the Milky Way halo and the intra-group medium (up to 3.4 Mpc), derived from the HESTIA simulations, a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce our Local Group; (ii) the DM contribution from the large-scale intergalactic medium beyond the Local Group (3.4 Mpc &lt; D &lt; 120 Mpc), calculated using the HAMLET reconstructed matter density field; and (iii) the individual DM contributions from Local Universe galaxy halos and clusters based on data from the 2MASS Galaxy Group Catalog and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. This comprehensive model will be made available as a Python package. As the most realistic model to date for DM in the local volume, it promises to improve the constraints of DM contributions from the Intergalactic Medium and Circumgalactic Medium of FRBs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cosmic baryon distribution calculations based on DM analysis of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Steepest Growth in the Primordial Power Spectrum from Excited States at a Sudden Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden phase transitions during inflation can give rise to strongly enhanced primordial density perturbations on scales much smaller than those directly probed by cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this paper, we study the effect of the incoming quantum state on the steepest growth found in the primordial power spectrum using a simple model of an instantaneous transition during single-field inflation. We consider the case of a general de Sitter-invariant initial state for the inflaton field (the $\alpha$-vacuum), and also an incoming state perturbed by a preceding transition. For the $\alpha$-vacua we find that $k^6$ growth is possible for $\alpha&gt;0$, while $k^4$ growth is seen for $\alpha\leq0$, including the standard case of an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The features of an enhanced primordial power spectrum on small scales are thus sensitive to the initial quantum state during inflation. We calculate the scalar-induced gravitational wave power spectrum for each case.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3: Blue Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies poses a challenge to weak lensing analyses. The Dark Energy Survey is expected to be less impacted by IA when limited to blue, star-forming galaxies. The cosmological parameter constraints from this blue cosmic shear sample are stable to IA model choice, unlike passive galaxies in the full DES Y3 sample, the goodness-of-fit is improved and the $\Omega_{m}$ and $S_8$ better agree with the cosmic microwave background. Mitigating IA with sample selection, instead of flexible model choices, can reduce uncertainty in $S_8$ by a factor of 1.5.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of SN 2022jli: the first double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova showing periodic undulations and dust emission at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical and IR observations from maximum light until around 600 d of SN 2022jli, a peculiar SE SN showing two maxima, each one with a peak luminosity of about 3 x 10^{42} erg/s and separated by 50 d. The second maximum is followed by periodic undulations with a period of P ~ 12.5 days. The spectra and the photometric evolution of the first maximum are consistent with the behaviour of a standard SE SN with an ejecta mass of 1.5 +/- 0.4 Msun, and a nickel mass of 0.12 +/- 0.01 Msun. The optical spectra after 400 d correspond to a standard SN Ic event, and at late times SN 2022jli exhibits a significant drop in the optical luminosity implying that the physical phenomena that produced the secondary maximum has ceased to power the SN light curve. One possibility is that the second maximum is powered by a magnetar with an initial spin period of P=48.5 ms and a magnetic field of B = 8.5x10^{14} G, while the light curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material from a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system. The near-IR spectra shows clear 1st CO overtone emission from about 190 d after the first maximum, and it becomes undetected at 400 d. A significant near-IR excess from hot dust emission is detected at 238 d produced by either newly formed dust in the SN ejecta or due to a strong near-IR dust echo. Depending on the assumptions of the dust composition, the estimated dust mass is 2-16 x 10^{-4} Msun. The magnetar power of the second maximum can fit in a more general picture where magnetars are the power source of super-luminous SNe, could produce their frequent bumps and undulations, and where pulsars could produce the late time excess observed in some SE SNe. The detection of CO and the potential detection of dust formed in the ejecta of SN2022jli are important to understand the formation molecules and dust in the ejecta of SE SNe.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitational Waves During Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from interactions in the thermal plasma. We extend the existing literature by incorporating the reheating phase into the thermal history. Our results show that the amplitude of the GW spectrum can be significantly enhanced because the temperature during reheating can be much higher than the reheating temperature. Furthermore, since the temperature evolution during reheating differs from that of free radiation, the peak frequency of the spectrum can also shift. Additionally, the morphology of the spectrum can present characteristic features. We also compute the contribution of the integrated GW spectrum to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, which can be substantially larger.</description>

      <title>CCAT: LED Mapping and Characterization of the 280 GHz TiN KID Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prime-Cam, one of the primary instruments for the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) developed by the CCAT Collaboration, will house up to seven instrument modules, with the first operating at 280 GHz. Each module will include three arrays of superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The first KID array fabricated for the 280 GHz module uses titanium-nitride (TiN) as the superconducting material and has 3,456 individual detectors, while the other two arrays use aluminum. This paper presents the design and laboratory characterization of the 280 GHz TiN array, which is cooled below its critical temperature to ~0.1 K and read out over six RF feedlines. LED mapping, a technique for matching the measured resonant frequency of a detector to its physical position, was performed on the array so that the results can be used to lithographically trim the KID capacitors and increase the yield of the array by reducing frequency collisions. We present the methods and results of LED mapping the 280 GHz TiN KID array before deployment on FYST.</description>

      <title>Dust Battery: A Novel Mechanism for Seed Magnetic Field Generation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel dust battery mechanism for generating seed magnetic fields in the early universe, in which charged dust grains are radiatively accelerated, inducing strong electric currents that subsequently generate magnetic fields. Our analysis demonstrates that this process is effective even at very low metallicities (approximately $ \sim 10^{-5} Z_\odot$), and capable of producing seed fields with significant amplitudes of $B \sim \rm \mu G$ around luminous sources over timescales of years to Myr and across spatial scales ranging from au to kpc. Crucially, we find that this mechanism is generically $\sim10^8$ times more effective than the radiatively-driven electron battery or Biermann battery in relatively cool gas ($\ll 10^{5}\,$K), including both neutral and ionized gas. Furthermore, our results suggest that, to first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this process, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on macroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales or electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be amplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, we propose a sub-grid model for integration into cosmological simulations, and the required electric-field expressions for magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-a-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations that explicitly model dust dynamics. Finally, we explore the broad applicability of this mechanism across different scales and conditions, emphasizing its robustness compared to other known battery mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We summarise the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe, and the possible ways in which they might come about. We then focus on gravitational waves, emphasising general qualitative features of stochastic backgrounds produced by early universe phase transitions and the cosmology of their present-day appearance. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the ways in which a stochastic background might be detected.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that low-mass primordial black holes cannot constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in our universe due to their predicted short lifetimes from the conventional Hawking radiation and evaporation process. Assuming physical black holes are nonsingular--likely due to quantum gravity or other high-energy physics--we demonstrate that a large class of nonsingular black holes have finite evaporation temperatures. This can lead to slowly evaporating low-mass black holes or to remnant mass states that circumvent traditional evaporation constraints. As a proof of concept, we explore the limiting curvature hypothesis and the evaporation process of a nonsingular black hole solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We identify generic features of the radiation profile and compare them with known regular black holes, such as the Bardeen solution in four dimensions. Remnant masses are proportional to the fundamental length scale, and we argue that slowly evaporating low-mass nonsingular black holes, or remnants, are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared interferometry has seen a revolution over the last few years. The advent of GRAVITY+ is about to enable high-contrast observations, all-sky coverage and faint science up to K=21, with the implementation on 8m-class telescope of extreme adaptive optics, wide-field observations, and soon laser guide stars, following a long-term vision of technological and infrastructure development at VLTI. This major progress in sensitivity lift a fundamental limitation of infrared interferometry, namely the brightness temperature achievable with this technique down to milli-arcsecond resolution imaging. This change of paradigm is a crucial element for the expansion of current arrays to a facility up to one to ten kilometer baselines. Micro-arcsecond scales imaging in the infrared on thermal objects, reaching the highest angular resolution possible even compared to VLBI, could offer a unique window in observational astronomy for the next generation instrument.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Axion Dark Matter Searches at LISA-like Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion or axion-like particle has been one of the leading candidates for dark matter. Due to its tiny coupling with photon, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities of light with different parity, an effect known as axion-induced birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the inter-spacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers in space to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have great sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19}~\text{eV}\sim 10^{-14}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>ADF22-WEB: A giant barred spiral starburst galaxy in the z = 3.1 SSA22 protocluster core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present-day universe, the most massive galaxies are ellipticals located in the cores of galaxy clusters, harboring the heaviest super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However the mechanisms that drive the early growth phase and subsequent transformation of these morphology and kinematics of galaxies remain elusive. Here we report (sub)kiloparsec scale observations of stars, gas, and dust in ADF22.A1, a bright dusty starburst galaxy at z=3.1, hosting a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus and residing in a proto-cluster core. ADF22.A1 is a giant spiral galaxy with the kinematics of a rotating disk with rotation velocity Vrot=530+/-10km/s and diameter larger than 30 kpc. The high specific stellar angular momentum of this system, j*=3400+/-600 kpc km/s, requires a mechanism to effectively spin-up ADF22.A1, indicating the importance of accretion from the cosmic web to supply both gas and angular momentum to galaxies in their early gas-rich starburst phase. In its inner region, gas flows along dust lanes in a bar connected with the bright dusty core and the estimated mass ratio of a bulge to SMBH matches the local relation, suggesting that bars are a key mechanism to shape the early co-evolution of these components. Comparison with cosmological simulations shows that ADF22.A1 will likely evolve into a massive elliptical at the present day, experiencing a significant reduction in angular momentum associated with subsequent galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution of dark matter subhaloes under tidal stripping by growing Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the findings of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of merger tree data from ultra-high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The analysis, conducted with a particle mass resolution of $5 \times 10^3 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass resolution of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, provides sufficient accuracy to suppress numerical artefacts. This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. The results demonstrate a significant alignment between the orbital elements predicted by the cold dark matter model and the observed data, providing robust support for the model as a credible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of metric-affine gravity theories, where the metric and connection are independent, we examine actions involving quadratic terms in the Ricci scalar curvature and the Holst invariant. These actions are non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We explore the behavior of the corresponding effective metric theory, which includes an extra dynamic pseudoscalar degree of freedom. Detailed analysis of inflationary predictions reveals compliance with recent observations across various parameters, potentially allowing a higher tensor-to-scalar ratio. The spectral index's direction of change varies based on parameter positioning.</description>

Abstract: The cascade phenomenon is fundamental to turbulence, a typical non-equilibrium system. In turbulence, energy is cascaded from large to small scales, where it is dissipated by fluid viscosity. Using Illustris and Virgo simulations, this paper presents the cascade in non-equilibrium collisionless dark matter flow. The cosmic energy of dark matter decreases with time, as if "dissipated" due to the expanding background. This is facilitated by the energy cascade from large to small haloes via halo merging and from large to small scales in individual haloes via particle migration in fluctuating non-uniform potential, such that the cosmic energy is "dissipated" on small scales. Inverse mass cascade across haloes of different sizes leads to a random walk of haloes in halo mass space. The halo mass function is naturally given by the Fokker-Planck equation for halo random walk. Similarly, the random walk of particles in haloes leads to the distribution of particles. The halo density profile can also be analytically derived. Universal scaling laws were identified for the halo density, mass, and velocity dispersion. The different inner density slopes of simulated haloes can be explained by the nonzero net mass and energy flux in individual haloes. The mass and energy cascade establishes a statistically steady state to continuously release energy and maximize entropy. The key feature of this state is scale-independent rates of cascade such that the statistical structures of the haloes are self-similar and scale-free, and there is no net accumulation of mass and energy on any intermediate scales. Since the waiting time and jumping length for particle random walk depends on the particle mass $m_p$, new mass constraints can be identified as $m_p\ge 10^{-15}$kg or $10^{12}$GeV. This constraint excludes standard WIMPs and suggests a heavy dark matter scenario (superheavy right-handed neutrinos, etc.).</description>

      <title>A deconstruction of methods to derive one-point lensing statistics</title>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ have been proposed as viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods and their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes, with a focus in the context where baryonic effects are negligible. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are effective for applications where lensing is mild, such as the majority of sources of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. However, both $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ break down for large values of convergence and magnification due to their loss of accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ yields second-to-fourth moments of the lensing PDFs, which are 6-10% smaller than those resulting from $N$-body simulations in regimes where baryonic effects are minimal. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <title>DESI Dark Energy Time Evolution is Recovered by Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide evidence that dark energy (DE) evolves with time, as parameterized by a $w_0 w_a$ equation of state. Cosmologically coupled black holes (BHs) provide a DE source that naturally evolves with time, because BH production tracks cosmic star-formation. Using DESI BAO measurements and priors informed by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we measure the fraction of baryonic density converted into BHs, assuming that all DE is sourced by BH production. We find that the best-fit DE density tracks each DESI best-fit $w_0w_a$ model within $1\sigma$, except at redshifts $z \lesssim 0.2$, highlighting limitations of the $w_0w_a$ parameterization. Cosmologically coupled BHs produce $H_0 = (69.94 \pm 0.81)~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with the same $\chi^2$ as $\Lambda$CDM, and with two fewer parameters than $w_0w_a$. This value reduces tension with SH0ES to $2.7\sigma$ and is in excellent agreement with recent measurements from the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program. Because cosmologically coupled BH production depletes the baryon density established by primordial nucleosynthesis, these BHs provide a physical explanation for the ``missing baryon problem'' and the anomalously low sum of neutrino masses preferred by DESI. The global evolution of DE is an orthogonal probe of cosmological coupling, complementing constraints on BH mass-growth from elliptical galaxies, stellar binaries, globular clusters, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA merging population, and X-ray binaries. A DE density that correlates with cosmic star-formation: 1) is a natural outcome of cosmological coupling in BH populations; 2) eases tension between early and late-time cosmological probes; and 3) produces time-evolution toward a late-time $\Lambda$CDM cosmology different from Cosmic Microwave Background projections.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the DM distribution function in the density spikes around PBHs</title>

Abstract: At the cosmological stage of radiation dominance, dark matter density spikes should form around primordial black holes. In the case when dark matter particles are able to annihilate, the density in the central regions of the spikes decreases due to the elimination of particles, which gives an upper bound on the central density. In this paper, the modification of the central density profile is investigated, taking into account the distribution of the particle orbits. The orbits in spike around a primordial black hole are very elongated, almost radial, and the angular momentum distribution has an exponential form. For such an initial distribution function, it is obtained that a cusp with the exponent $\approx-0.7$ is formed in the central region, instead of an annihilation plateau. The presence of the cusp provides some correction to the rate of dark matter annihilation around primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Data-Space Validation of High-Dimensional Models by Comparing Sample Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple method for assessing the predictive performance of high-dimensional models directly in data space when only samples are available. Our approach is to compare the quantiles of observables predicted by a model to those of the observables themselves. In cases where the dimensionality of the observables is large (e.g. multiband galaxy photometry), we advocate that the comparison is made after projection onto a set of principal axes to reduce the dimensionality. We demonstrate our method on a series of two-dimensional examples. We then apply it to results from a state-of-the-art generative model for galaxy photometry (pop-cosmos; arXiv:2402.00935) that generates predictions of colors and magnitudes by forward simulating from a 16-dimensional distribution of physical parameters represented by a score-based diffusion model. We validate the predictive performance of this model directly in a space of nine broadband colors. Although motivated by this specific example, we expect that the techniques we present will be broadly useful for evaluating the performance of flexible, non-parametric population models of this kind, and other settings where two sets of samples are to be compared.</description>

      <title>Projected gravitational wave constraints on primordial black hole abundance for extended mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the projected minimum constraints set by next-generation gravitational wave detectors Einstein Telescope and LISA on the abundance of primordial black holes relative to dark matter from both resolvable mergers and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) for extended primordial black hole mass distributions. We consider broad power law distributions for a range of negative and positive exponents $\gamma$ and top-hat distributions (with $\gamma=0$) and use the IMRPhenomXAS waveforms to simulate binary sources up to mass ratios $q_\mathrm{max} = 1000$ and redshifts $z=300$. Our results suggest that accounting for extended mass distributions have the most apparent impact when considering mergers at high redshifts $z &gt; 30$, for which the constraint curves have broader mass windows and shift to higher abundances compared to when a monochromatic distribution is assumed; on the other hand, constraints from low-redshift mergers and the SGWB do not change much with the assumed mass distribution. At high redshifts, astrophysical black holes are not expected to contribute significantly, providing possible smoking-gun evidence for PBHs. Constraints derived from LISA and ET observations would complement each other by probing different PBH mass windows and this holds for the extended mass distributions studied.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>
