      <title>Toward Non-Expert Customized Congestion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose congestion control algorithms (CCAs) are designed to achieve general congestion control goals, but they may not meet the specific requirements of certain users. Customized CCAs can meet certain users' specific requirements; however, non-expert users often lack the expertise to implement them. In this paper, we present an exploratory non-expert customized CCA framework, named NECC, which enables non-expert users to easily model, implement, and deploy their customized CCAs by leveraging Large Language Models and the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) interface. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the customized CCA implementation problem. Our evaluations using real-world CCAs show that the performance of NECC is very promising, and we discuss the insights that we find and possible future research directions.</description>

      <title>Nethira: A Heterogeneity-aware Hierarchical Pre-trained Model for Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic classification is vital for network security and management. The pre-training technology has shown promise by learning general traffic representations from raw byte sequences, thereby reducing reliance on labeled data. However, existing pre-trained models struggle with the gap between traffic heterogeneity (i.e., hierarchical traffic structures) and input homogeneity (i.e., flattened byte sequences). To address this gap, we propose Nethira, a heterogeneity-aware pre-trained model based on hierarchical reconstruction and augmentation. In pre-training, Nethira introduces hierarchical reconstruction at multiple levels-byte, protocol, and packet-capturing comprehensive traffic structural information. During fine-tuning, Nethira proposes a consistency-regularized strategy with hierarchical traffic augmentation to reduce label dependence. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Nethira outperforms seven existing pre-trained models, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 9.11%, and reaching comparable performance with only 1% labeled data on high-heterogeneity network tasks.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Secrecy Optimization in Hybrid RIS-Empowered and UAV-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a hybrid reconfigurable environment comprising a UAV-mounted reflecting RIS, an outdoor STAR-RIS enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, and an indoor holographic RIS (H-RIS), jointly enhancing secure downlink communication for indoor and outdoor users. The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments.</description>

      <title>MCP-Diag: A Deterministic, Protocol-Driven Architecture for AI-Native Network Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into network operations (AIOps) is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the stochastic grounding problem, where LLMs struggle to reliably parse unstructured, vendor-specific CLI output, and the security gap of granting autonomous agents shell access. This paper introduces MCP-Diag, a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We propose a deterministic translation layer that converts raw stdout from canonical utilities (dig, ping, traceroute) into rigorous JSON schemas before AI ingestion. We further introduce a mandatory "Elicitation Loop" that enforces Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) authorization at the protocol level. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that MCP-Diag achieving 100% entity extraction accuracy with less than 0.9% execution latency overhead and 3.7x increase in context token usage.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Synchronization: towards a data-centric architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology revolutionizes industrial processes by enabling the representation of physical entities and their dynamics to enhance productivity and operational efficiency. It has emerged as a vital enabling technology in the Industry 4.0 context. The present article examines the particular issue of synchronizing a digital twin while ensuring an accurate reflection of its physical counterpart. Despite the reported recent advances in the design of middleware and low delay communication technologies, effective synchronization between both worlds remains challenging. This paper reviews currently adopted synchronization technologies and architectures, identifies vital outstanding technical challenges, and proposes a unified synchronization architecture for use by various industrial applications while addressing security and interoperability requirements. As such, this study aims to bridges gaps and advance robust synchronization in DT environments, emphasizing the need for a standardized architecture to ensure seamless operation and continuous improvement of industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Lossy Compression of Cellular Network KPIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a fundamental component of mobile cellular network monitoring and optimization. Their massive volume, resulting from fine-grained measurements collected across many cells over long time horizons, poses significant challenges for storage, transport, and large-scale analysis. In this letter, we show that common cellular KPIs can be efficiently compressed using standard lossy compression schemes based on prediction, quantization, and entropy coding, achieving substantial reductions in reporting overhead. Focusing on traffic volume KPIs, we first characterize their intrinsic compressibility through a rate-distortion analysis, showing that signal-to-noise ratios around 30 dB can be achieved using only 3-4 bits per sample, corresponding to an 8-10x reduction with respect to 32-bit floating-point representations. We then assess the impact of KPI compression on representative downstream analytics tasks. Our results show that aggregation across cells mitigates quantization errors and that prediction accuracy is unaffected beyond a moderate reporting rate. These findings indicate that KPI compression is feasible and transparent to network-level analytics in cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition for Low-Resource Healthcare Using Classical Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited access to medical infrastructure forces elderly and vulnerable patients to rely on home-based care, often leading to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises such as yoga or physiotherapy. To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Real-World Impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography on WPA-Enterprise Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large-scale quantum computers poses a significant threat to contemporary network security protocols, including Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)-Enterprise authentication. To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the resulting overhead can be effectively mitigated through session resumption. Overall, this work presents a first real-world performance evaluation of PQC-enabled WPA-Enterprise authentication and demonstrates its practical feasibility for enterprise Wi-Fi deployments.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase.
