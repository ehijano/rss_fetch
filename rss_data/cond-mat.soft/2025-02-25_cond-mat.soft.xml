      <title>Structural and mechanical characterisation of nylon fibre aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of fibre networks is of great importance due to their appearance in a wide range of natural and industrial processes. These networks are particularly complex because their properties depend not only on the characteristics of individual fibres but also on their collective arrangements within the network. In this study, we investigate the case of nylon fibre aggregates that were generated in a turbulent von Karman flow. The key properties of these aggregates are characterized, including their three-dimensional structures, analysed through X-ray tomography, and their mechanical responses. The results are compared with those observed for aegagropilae, a natural fibre aggregate commonly found on the Mediterranean sea shore</description>

      <title>Effect of Particle Shape on Stratification in Drying Films of Binary Colloidal Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of particle shape in evaporation-induced auto-stratification in dispersed colloidal suspensions is explored with molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of solid spheres, aspherical particles, and hollow spheres. A unified framework is proposed for the stratification phenomena in systems that feature size or shape dispersity on the basis of two processes: diffusion and diffusiophoresis. In general, diffusion favors the accumulation of particles that diffuse more slowly at the evaporation front. However, particles with larger surface areas have larger diffusiophoretic mobilities and are more likely to be driven away from the evaporation front by the concentration gradients of other particles with smaller surface areas. In the case of a bidisperse colloidal suspension containing small and large solid spheres studied in most of the work reported in the literature, the competition between the two leads to the so-called "small-on-top" stratification when the suspension is rapidly dried, as diffusiophoresis dominates near the interface. Here we employ a computational model of composite particles that mimics the Rouse model of polymers, where the diffusion coefficient of a particle is inversely proportional to its mass. For a mixture of solid spheres and aspherical particles or hollow spheres with similar masses, the diffusion contrast is reduced and the solid spheres are always enriched at the evaporation front, as they have the smallest surface area for a given mass and therefore the lowest diffusiophoretic mobility. The unified framework is further corroborated with a case study of a mixture of solid and hollow spheres having the same outer radius and thus the same surface area. In this case, the diffusiophoretic contrast is suppressed and the solid spheres, which have a larger mass and thus a smaller diffusion coefficient, are found to accumulate at the evaporation front.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Induced Fluctuating Interfaces in Heterogeneously-Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of heterogeneous (spatially varying) activity in a hydrodynamical model for dense bacterial suspensions, confining ourselves to experimentally realizable, simple, quenched, activity patterns. We show that the evolution of the bacterial velocity field under such activity patterning leads to the emergence of hydrodynamic interfaces separating spatially localized turbulence from jammed frictional surroundings. We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers. This work reveals how naturally occurring heterogeneities could decisively steer active flows into more complex configurations than those typically studied, opening up parallels to droplet dynamics, front propagation and turbulent mixing layers.</description>

      <title>Curved crack paths are predicted by elastic-charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting crack trajectories in brittle solids remains an open challenge in fracture mechanics due to the non-local nature of crack propagation and the way cracks modify their surrounding medium. Here, we develop a framework for analytically predicting crack trajectories, similar to predicting the motion of charged particles in external fields within Newtonian mechanics. We demonstrate that a crack can be described as a distribution of elastic charges, and within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), its interaction with the background stress can be approximated by a singular geometric charge at the crack tip. The cracks motion is then predicted as the propagation of this singular charge within the unperturbed stress field. We apply our approach to study crack trajectories near defects and validate it through experiments on flat elastomer sheets containing an edge dislocation. The experimental results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, including the convergence of curved crack trajectories toward a single focal point. We discuss future extension of our theory to the motion of multiple interacting cracks. Our findings highlight the potential of the elastic-charges approach to significantly advance classical fracture mechanics by enabling analytical solutions to problems traditionally requiring numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Polydisperse Achiral Near-Rigid Nematogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding chirality transfer from the molecular to the macroscopic scale poses a significant challenge in soft and biological condensed matter physics. Many nanorods of biological origin not only have chiral molecular features but also exhibit a spread in contour length leading to considerable size dispersity. On top of this, random backbone fluctuations are ubiquitous for non-rigid particles but their role in chirality transfer remains difficult to disentangle from that of their native chirality imparted by their effective shape or surface architecture. We report spontaneous entropy-driven chiral symmetry breaking from molecular simulations of cholesteric liquid-crystals formed from achiral bead-spring rods with a continuous spread in contour length and marginal chain bending. The symmetry-breaking is caused by long-lived chiral conformations of long rods undergoing chiral synchronization leading to a homochiral twisted nematic. A simple theory demonstrates that even without chiral synchronization, the presence of shape-persistent configurational fluctuations along with length-dispersity can be harnessed to generate non-zero chirality at moderate polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Topologically cloaked magnetic colloidal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloaking is a method of making obstacles undetectable. Here we cloak unit cells of a magnetic pattern squeezed into an otherwise periodic pattern from a magnetically driven colloidal flow. We apply a time-periodic external magnetic field loop to an ensemble of paramagnetic colloidal particles on the deformed periodic magnetic pattern. There exist topological loops where the particles avoid to trespass the cloaked regions by robustly traveling around the cloak. Afterwards the ensemble of particles continues with a motion identical to the motion as if the distorted region were nonexistent and the ensemble would have trespassed the undeformed region. We construct the cloak by continuously squeezing new conformally mapped unit cells between those of the originally undeformed and periodic pattern. We find a cloaking/decloaking transition as a function of the size and shape of the newly squeezed-in region. A cloak is scalable to arbitrary size if the biholomorphic map from the undistorted periodic lattice to the region outside the cloak locally rotates by less than an angle of forty five degrees. The work generalizes cloaking from waves toward particles.</description>

      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of \textit{Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>

      <title>High second harmonic generation in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals by doping with optimally oriented chromophores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the second harmonic generation performance of a ferroelectric nematic fluid consisting of the prototype ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, RM734 mixed with the classical chromophore Dispersed-Orange 3 at 5 %wt. The mixture exhibits an interesting mesomorphic behavior with a wide temperature range of the ferroelectric mesophase, high nematic order parameter and ease of alignment in cells. In the study, two fundamental wavelengths (1064 nm and 1574 nm) have been used in order to account for the second harmonic generation performance in transparent and absorbing regimens. The results have been very outstanding and are among the highest for liquid crystals so far. Specifically, second order susceptibility tensor components of up to 25 pmV-1 and 8.5 pmV-1 have been obtained in the absorbing and transparent regimens, respectively. The mixing of chromophores with ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals is then stablished as a promising strategy in the search of high-performance nonlinear-optical mesogens.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relation between elastic and relaxation properties of dry, frictional granular media during shear deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using discrete element simulations based on molecular dynamics, we investigate the mechanical behavior of sheared, dry, frictional granular media in the "dense" and "critical" regimes. We find that this behavior is partitioned between transient stages and a final stationary stage. While the later is macroscopically consistent with the predictions of the viscous, $\mu(I)$ rheology, both the macroscopic behavior during the transient stages and the overall microscopic behavior suggest a more complex picture. Indeed, the simulated granular medium exhibits a finite elastic stiffness throughout its entire shear deformation history, although topological rearrangements of the grains at the microscale translate into a partial degradation of this stiffness, which can be interpreted as a form of elastic damage. The relaxation of stresses follows a compressed exponential, also highlighting the role of elastic interactions in the medium, with residual stresses that depend on the level of elastic damage. The established relations between elastic and relaxation properties point to a complex rheology, characterized by a damage-dependent transition between a visco-elasto-plastic and a viscous behavior.</description>

      <title>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineering non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into Formation of Bicontinuous Emulsion Gels via in-situ (Ultra-)Small Angle X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.</description>

      <title>Structural Anisotropy Stabilises Asymmetric Beating in Instability Driven Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending moduli impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending moduli ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Particle geometry space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</description>

      <title>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Observation of mechanical kink control and generation via phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground states associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many phenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.</description>

      <title>Turbulent-like flows in quasi two-dimensional dense suspensions of motile colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds numbers, driven by the activity of the microswimmers. In this study, we develop a model system to examine these dynamics using motile colloids that mimic bacterial locomotion. The colloids are powered by the Quincke instability, which causes them to spontaneously roll in a random-walk pattern when exposed to a square-wave electric field. We experimentally investigate the flow dynamics in dense suspensions of these Quincke random walkers under quasi two-dimensional conditions, where the particle size is comparable to the gap between the electrodes. Our results reveal an energy spectrum scaling at high wavenumbers as $ \sim k^{-4}$, which holds across a broad range of activity levels -- controlled by the field strength -- and particle concentrations. We observe that velocity time correlations decay within a single period of the square-wave field, yet an anti-correlation appears between successive field applications, indicative of a dynamic structural memory of the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of soft interacting particles on a comb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the coarse-grained particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Training and re-training liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials for pluripotent functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training has emerged as a promising materials design technique in which function can be acheived through repeated physical modification of an existing material rather than by direct chemical functionalization, cutting or reprocessing. This work investigates both the ability to train for function and then to erase that function on-demand in macroscopic metamaterials made from liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). We first show that the Poisson's ratio of these disordered arrays can be tuned via directed aging to induce an auxetic response. We then show that the arrays can be reset and re-trained for another local mechanical function, allostery, thus demonstrating pluripotent functionality.</description>

      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Bulk electricity storage in 1-nm water channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanometer-scale solid-state confinement has been shown to change water's structure and dynamics, offering new horizons in energy storage. However, most current materials operate at the micrometer scale, missing the interfacial effects that occur at three orders of magnitude smaller dimensions. Here, we report a scalable energy storage device that uses ultraconfined water as its sole electrolyte, unlocking the advantages of nanoscale confinement. We use the polarizability and proton 'superconductivity' of water confined in few-molecular-diameters clay channels to build an all-water supercapacitor. The device fabricated from reconstructed clay, graphene, and water by a sustainable self-assembly process, operates at voltages up to 1.65 V, has competitive power and energy density, and maintains near 100% Coulombic efficiency over 60,000 charge-discharge cycles. These results demonstrate the application of unique properties of ultraconfined water for sustainable energy storage and provide a benchmark for a class of novel ultraconfined water energy systems, or 'blue devices'.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.</description>
