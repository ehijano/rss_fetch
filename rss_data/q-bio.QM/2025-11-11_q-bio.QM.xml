      <title>Selective Diabetic Retinopathy Screening with Accuracy-Weighted Deep Ensembles and Entropy-Guided Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05529v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.</description>

      <title>HuBMAP Data Portal: A Resource for Multi-Modal Spatial and Single-Cell Data of Healthy Human Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) Data Portal (https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/) serves as a comprehensive repository for multi-modal spatial and single-cell data from healthy human tissues. This resource facilitates the NIH HuBMAP consortium's mission to create a widely accessible multi-scale spatial atlas of the healthy human body at single-cell resolution. As of October 2025, the portal hosts 5,032 datasets from 22 different data types spanning 27 organ classes across 310 donors. The portal's infrastructure and user interfaces enable efficient visualization and analysis directly in web browsers through integrated collaborative Jupyter workspaces and interactive Vitessce visualizations for over 1,500 non-spatial, 2D, and 3D spatial datasets. Uniform processing pipelines and rigorous quality control processes ensure comparability of results from different laboratories, organs, and donors for large-scale analyses, while externally processed, community-contributed datasets (EPICs) provide complementary perspectives. The portal interface supports both metadata- and data-driven search functionalities, bulk downloads, and integrated data collections, including supplementary data and visualizations for consortium publications.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive load measurement in the human tibia via spectral analysis of flexural waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forces transmitted by bones are routinely studied in human biomechanics, but it is challenging to measure them non-invasively, especially outside of the laboratory setting. We introduce a technique for non-invasive, in vivo measurement of tibial compression force using flexural waves propagating in the tibia. Modeling the tibia as an axially compressed Euler-Bernoulli beam, we show that tibial flexural waves have load-dependent frequency spectra. Specifically, under physiological conditions, peak locations in the acceleration amplitude spectrum shift linearly with the compression force on the tibia, and may be used as proxy force measure. We test the validity of this technique using a proof-of-principle wearable system that generates flexural waves via a skin-mounted mechanical transducer and measures the spectra of these waves using a skin-mounted accelerometer. In agreement with beam theory, data from three participants demonstrate linear relationships between tibial compression force and peak frequency location with Pearson correlation coefficients $r=0.88$--$0.97$ for medial-lateral swaying and $r=0.88$--$0.95$ for walking trials. Our flexural wave-based technique could give rise to a new class of wearable sensors for non-invasive physiological load monitoring and measurement, impacting research in human locomotion, sports medicine, and prosthetic design.</description>

      <title>Geometric and statistical analysis of avian skull morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the growth and form of shapes is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. While many prior works have analyzed the beak shapes of Darwin's finches, other cranial features are relatively less explored. In this work, we develop geometric and statistical methods for analyzing the skull morphology of Darwin's finches and their relatives, focusing on the relationship between their skull dimensions, orbit curvature, and neurocranial geometries. Specifically, by utilizing tools in computational geometry, differential geometry, and numerical optimization, we develop efficient algorithms for quantifying various key geometric features of the skull. We then perform a statistical analysis and discover a strong correlation between skull size and orbit curvature. Based on our findings, we further establish a predictive model that can estimate the orbit curvature using easily obtainable linear skull measurements. Our results show that the predictive model is highly effective and is capable of explaining 85.48\% of the variance (R-squared) in curvature with an average prediction error of only 6.35\%. Altogether, our work provides a quantitative foundation for understanding the functional and evolutionary pressures that shape avian skulls, thereby offering a validated framework for future studies in comparative anatomy and evolutionary biology.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Interactions in Brain Connectomics: Implicit versus Explicit Modeling Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system defined by multi-way, higher-order interactions invisible to traditional pairwise network models. Although a diverse array of analytical methods has been developed to address this shortcoming, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unifying conceptual framework that integrates and organizes the rapidly expanding methodological landscape of higher-order brain connectivity. This review provides a synthesis of the methodologies for studying higher-order brain connectivity. We propose a fundamental distinction between implicit paradigms, which quantify the statistical strength of group interactions, and explicit paradigms, which construct higher-order structural representations like hypergraphs and topological data analysis. We trace the evolution of each approach, from early Correlation-of-Correlations and information-theoretic concepts of synergy/redundancy, to the edge-centric paradigm and advanced topological methods. Through a critical analysis of conceptual, statistical, and computational challenges, we argue that the future of the field lies not in a single best method, but in a principled integration of these complementary approaches. This manuscript aims to provide a unified map and a critical perspective to guide researchers toward a robust and insightful understanding of the brain's complex, multi-level architecture.</description>

      <title>GastroDL-Fusion: A Dual-Modal Deep Learning Framework Integrating Protein-Ligand Complexes and Gene Sequences for Gastrointestinal Disease Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of menopause from deconvolution of millions of lab tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Menopause reshapes female physiology, yet its full temporal footprint is obscured by uncertainty in the age of the final menstrual period (FMP). Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image "de-blurring" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.</description>

      <title>LLM$^3$-DTI: A Large Language Model and Multi-modal data co-powered framework for Drug-Target Interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.</description>

      <title>Dual-Pathway Fusion of EHRs and Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Unseen Drug-Drug Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-discontinuous DNA Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.</description>

      <title>De-Individualizing fMRI Signals via Mahalanobis Whitening and Bures Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model to Shrink Proteins While Maintaining Their Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.</description>

Abstract: The anti-cancer immune response relies on the bindings between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and antigens, which elicits adaptive immunity to eliminate tumor cells. This ability of the immune system to respond to novel various neoantigens arises from the immense diversity of TCR repository. However, TCR diversity poses a significant challenge on accurately predicting antigen-TCR bindings. In this study, we introduce a lightweight masked language model, termed tcrLM, to address this challenge. Our approach involves randomly masking segments of TCR sequences and training tcrLM to infer the masked segments, thereby enabling the extraction of expressive features from TCR sequences. To further enhance robustness, we incorporate virtual adversarial training into tcrLM. We construct the largest TCR CDR3 sequence set with more than 100 million distinct sequences, and pretrain tcrLM on these sequences. The pre-trained encoder is subsequently applied to predict TCR-antigen binding specificity. We evaluate model performance on three test datasets: independent, external, and COVID-19 test set. The results demonstrate that tcrLM not only surpasses existing TCR-antigen binding prediction methods, but also outperforms other mainstream protein language models. More interestingly, tcrLM effectively captures the biochemical properties and positional preference of amino acids within TCR sequences. Additionally, the predicted TCR-neoantigen binding scores indicates the immunotherapy responses and clinical outcomes in a melanoma cohort. These findings demonstrate the potential of tcrLM in predicting TCR-antigen binding specificity, with significant implications for advancing immunotherapy and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Infrared Microscopy of Biochemistry and Metabolism in Single Living Eukaryotic Cells</title>

Abstract: The turn of the millennium has seen a growing interest in the study of live cells by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, driven by the versatility, wealth of molecular information, and potential for high-throughput screening of the technique. Measurements on individual cells, either isolated or within a multi-cellular structure, provide information that is not available from ensemble samples. The present review discusses the use of infrared (IR) microscopy to analyse live single cells from a biochemical perspective, seeking information on real-time processes. The emphasis is on the use of the technique to quantify metabolic turnover, with the aim of providing a complementary method for metabolomics, and for toxicological and pharmacological studies. The work highlights the methodological advances and proof-of-concept experiments that took place over the past few years in this direction. It discusses current advantages and limitations of the technique, including the possibility of detecting specific biomolecules and their reactivity, and it concludes with a brief outline of future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Convergence-divergence models: Generalizations of phylogenetic trees modeling gene flow over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are simple models of evolutionary processes. They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>
