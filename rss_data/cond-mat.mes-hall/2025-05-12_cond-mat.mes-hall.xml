      <title>Optimizing superlattice bilayer graphene for a fractional Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene modulated by a superlattice potential is a highly tunable system predicted to realize isolated topological flat bands. In this work we calculate the band structure and quantum geometry of bilayer graphene subject to both triangular and square superlattices, across a wide range of gate voltages. We identify the parameter regime that optimizes the "single-particle indicators" for the stability of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) when a topological flat band is partially filled. Our results guide the experimental realization of an FCI in this platform.</description>

      <title>Diverse electronic phases correlated with twist-angle distribution and pseudomagnetic field in turbostratic graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene has become a focal point of research due to its ability to host a range of quantum phases, including unconventional superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and strong correlation effects. In the present work, we address the challenge of investigating the diverse physics associated with a variety of twist-angles in a simple graphene platform which is economic and bypasses the tedious process of fabricating multiple devices, each with one twist angle. We used turbostratic graphene films containing a variety of twist angles characterized by distinct Moir\'e patterns observed through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and distinct signatures recorded by Raman spectroscopy. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we show that the local twist angles remarkably correlate with the characteristic local electronic properties. Most remarkably, the films spontaneously generate strained wrinkles during growth, with certain wrinkled regions exhibiting robust strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, as recorded by ultra-low temperature STS.</description>

      <title>Directed light emission from monolayers on 2D materials via optical interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials provide a rich platform to explore phenomena such as emerging electronic and excitonic states, strong light-matter coupling and new optoelectronic device concepts. The optical response of monolayers is entangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a two-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the two-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore essential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a function of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection and emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of light reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer matrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical interference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical properties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our findings are general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a substrate. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate parameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities in applications such as lighting technology where the direction of light emission can be controlled via substrate thickness.</description>

      <title>Inferring charge noise source locations from correlations in spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra do not fit well a power law; rather, we can recognize a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.</description>

      <title>Synthetic gauge field enabled realization of bulk- and edge-transported states in an aperiodic acoustic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states with immunity against various disorders have been implemented in a variety of topological insulators. In this Letter, we reveal that Landau levels in aperiodic acoustic structures can be achieved under different pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs). The produced zero order Landau modes (ZOLMs) could transmit along the channels at the interior or exterior of the inhomogeneous array, which are separately termed as "bulk-transported states" (BTSs) and "edge-transported states" (ETSs). Distinct from conventional valley edge states, the ZOLMs show intriguing self-collimation feature. If a pseudoelectric field (PEF) is further included, the combination of a PMF and PEF can result in the formation of bulk or edge Landau rainbow, where Landau zero modes are distributed at various positions of the bulk or boundary of the sample at different frequencies. The synthetic-gauge-field-controlled topological states can enable fully control of robust transmission, and using the entire footprint of a topological lattice. Our findings not only profoundly advance the current understanding of topological phase matter but also offer new avenues for constructing topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Generation of non-equilibrium spin-motive force at the surface of a topological insulator induced by current-driven domain wall motion in the magnetic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Faraday method can be used for computation of spin-motive force (SMF) within the unitary transformation approach. Meanwhile, the unitary transformation approach, which could be employed to obtain an effective collinear exchange interaction of non-collinear magnetic structures, cannot be used when the other parts of the Hamiltonian contain spin-dependent couplings. In the current study, the method of unitary transformation has been generalized to systems with spin-momentum coupling. In this way, the SMF at topological insulator surfaces has been computed analytically.</description>

      <title>Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowires with micromagnet arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction accounts for the coupling of momentum and spin degrees of freedom of electrons and holes in semiconductor materials. In quantum information processing, it allows for electrical control of spin states and for the engineering of topologically protected Majorana zero modes. Although such functionalities were previously considered to be limited to semiconductor materials with strong intrinsic spin-orbit interactions only, recent theoretical work proposes using external rotating magnetic fields to engineer synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This would relax material constraints and open up new research directions for materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit interaction or augment existing spin-orbit interaction in materials in which this interaction is already strong. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and introduce rotating magnetic fields along an InAs/Al hybrid nanowire using permalloy micromagnet arrays which yields an estimated synthetic Rashba spin-orbit interaction coefficient of 0.022 eV nm. We use transport spectroscopy and the energy dependence of Andreev bound states in the nanowires as a probe of the magnetic field profiles of the micromagnets which are reconfigurably prepared in parallel or antiparallel magnetization configurations.</description>

      <title>The role of non-equilibrium populations in dark exciton formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide structures, the optical excitation of a bright exciton may be followed by the formation of a plethora of lower energy dark states. In these formation and relaxation processes between different exciton species, non-equilibrium exciton and phonon populations play a dominant role, but remain so far largely unexplored as most states are inaccessible by regular spectroscopies. Here, on the example of homobilayer 2H-MoS$_2$, we realize direct access to the full exciton relaxation cascade from experiment and theory. By measuring the energy- and in-plane momentum-resolved photoemission spectral function, we reveal a distinct fingerprint for dark excitons in a non-equilibrium excitonic occupation distribution. In excellent agreement with microscopic many-particle calculations, we quantify the timescales for the formation of a non-equilibrium dark excitonic occupation and its subsequent thermalization to 85~fs and 150~fs, respectively. Our results provide a previously inaccessible view of the complete exciton relaxation cascade, which is of paramount importance for the future characterization of non-equilibrium excitonic phases and the efficient design of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Exchange as the Origin of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over two decades, the role of structural chirality in spin polarization has been widely investigated, with implications for the origins of life, catalysis, and quantum phenomena. Yet, it remains unclear whether all chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects arise from a common mechanism. We show that breaking all mirror symmetries in structurally chiral electron systems enforces a twin-pair electron exchange, inherently violating both parity P and time-reversal T symmetry while preserving combined PT-symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This exchange produces chiral quantum states where electron spin and motion are intrinsically linked, a key feature of CISS. At interfaces, these states drive spin and charge accumulation via spin-momentum locking. Our findings establish a new paradigm connecting quantum statistics, non-Hermitian physics, and spin transport with structural chirality. This framework unifies all observed CISS effects and provides guiding principles for designing chiral materials for spintronic and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Fractional Statistics and Electron Transfer at Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for electron transfer (ET) at graphene defects, treating the surface as a Dirac cone with a localized defect state coupled to a vibrational environment. Using a polaron transformation combined with a modified density of states, we derive an explicit expression for the ET rate that incorporates both vibrational reorganization and fractionalized quasiparticle statistics. We show that fractional statistics, modeled through a power-law density of states, suppress low-energy ET near resonance and introduce tunable deviations from conventional Marcus-like kinetics. Our results suggest that strain, defect engineering, or chemical modification could stabilize fractional excitations in graphene-based catalysts, offering new strategies for controlling surface reactivity. These findings provide a foundation for future experimental and computational investigations into the role of topology and fractional statistics in chemical electron transfer.</description>

      <title>Quantitative calibration of a TWPA applied to an optomechanical platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +-20 %.</description>

      <title>Bipolar doping in van der Waals semiconductor through Flexo-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping plays a key role in functionalizing semiconductor devices, yet traditional chemical approaches relying on foreign-atom incorporation suffer from doping-asymmetry, pronounced lattice disorder and constrained spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate a physical doping technique to directly write nanoscale doping patterns into layered semiconductors (MoS2). By applying localized tensile and compressive stress via an atomic force microscopy probe, p and n type conductance are simultaneously written into the designed area with sub-100-nm resolution, as verified by spatially resolved capacitance and photocurrent experiments. Density functional theory calculations reveal strain-driven shifts of donor and acceptor levels, as large as several hundreds of meV, linking mechanical stress to semiconductor doping. Fabricated strain-engineered junction efficiently rectifies the current flow and performs logic operations with stable dynamic response. This strain-driven approach enables spatially precise doping in van der Waals materials without degrading crystallinity, offering a versatile platform for nanoscale semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.</description>

      <title>Above-room-temperature ferromagnetism in large-area epitaxial Fe3GaTe2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits a high Curie temperature (TC) ~ 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van der Waals heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking. Consequently, the controlled large-scale growth of FGaT and related heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a breakthrough in the high-quality, large-scale growth of epitaxial FGaT thin films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of the continuous FGaT/graphene van der Waals heterostructures. Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal robust PMA with an enhanced TC well above room temperature, reaching up to 400 K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions, further validating the high TC and robust PMA. These findings are highly significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation data storage, logic processing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the magneto-optical response in valley polarized Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the last century, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of valley-degenerate narrow gap semiconductors, such as the Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se alloy. This material possesses band edges at the $L$-points of their Brillouin zone, yielding a valley degeneracy of four. However, in (111)-oriented films, it is still not fully understood how differences between the longitudinal valley, oriented along the growth axis, and the oblique valleys, oriented at an angle with respect to that axis, appear in infrared magneto-optical spectroscopy. In this work, we report a magneto-optical study on this family of alloys, focusing on an anomaly in the interband transition of the absorption strength ratio between longitudinal and oblique valleys under a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction. Based on the Mitchell-Wallis model, we provide a theoretical fit for the experimental transmission data, which quantitatively explains the spectral shape of the data at magnetic fields as high as 35T. In particular, we attribute this anomalous absorption strength variation to the carrier density difference between the two types of valleys as well as the field-dependent multiple-beam interference or the Fabry-P\'{e}rot interference. Our analysis also allows for the extraction of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal requirements that induce a nonreciprocal response to temperature differences in a mesoscopic electronic conductor. We identify two distinct mechanisms involved in electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic scattering and screening, that locally affect the internal properties of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification effects in the absence of inversion symmetry. We propose resonant tunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations acting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same direction irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, a case of antireciprocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The texture in antiferromagnets hosting a topologically protected skyrmion can be viewed as two effectively coupled ferromagnetic skyrmions. Assuming rigid magnetic configurations, we show that this coupling results in an effective mass of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion and that its dynamics can be viewed as due to a relative displacement of the two sublattice ferromagnetic skyrmions. The theory holds for different antiferromagnetic systems and includes effects from dissipation and external forces caused by electric currents. We verify our analytical results by micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moir\'e graphene.</description>

      <title>High-chirality and multiquaternion Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain random media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations for the non-local electron-hole vertex in high spatial dimensions to describe the vanishing of diffusion in Anderson localization. It is caused by forming a quantum bound state between the diffusing particle and the hole left behind. Divergence in a new time scale proportional to the electrical polarizability signals the Anderson localization transition. Consequently, the height of the peak of the dynamical conductivity at zero frequency, the static diffusion constant, is not pushed to zero at the localization transition but rather its width. Spatially localized quantum bound states in the localized phase cannot be described by the continuity and wave equations in the Hilbert space of Bloch waves.</description>

      <title>Optical Switching of $\chi^{(2)}$ in Diamond Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond's unique physical properties make it a versatile materials for a wide range of nonlinear and quantum photonic technologies. However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$. Optical control of $\chi^{(2)}$ by defect engineering opens the door for second-order nonlinear processes in diamond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>
