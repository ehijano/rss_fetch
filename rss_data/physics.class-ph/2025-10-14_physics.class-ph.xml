      <title>Modelling Intra-driver Behavioral Adaptation through Risk Sensitivity and Regime Transitions: A Task-difficulty Car-following Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a growing trend toward integrating human factors (HF) into traffic flow models to better understand the complexities of human behavior and its impact on traffic dynamics. This research seeks to advance this trend by bridging the gap between traditional car-following models and the inherent variability of human driving behavior. By incorporating these elements, our models provide valuable insights into how driver behavior adaptation and risk-taking influence traffic flow dynamics. Specifically, the study proposes a model called Intelligent Driver Model Task Saturation that integrates human behavioral adaptations and risk-taking strategies into a modified version of the established Intelligent Driver Model, enriched by a cognitive layer based on Fuller's Task Capability Interface model. This amalgamation offers a perspective on the interplay between driver behavior adaptation when the driving task saturates and the risk-taking strategy of drivers. When total task demand exceeds task capacity, drivers may adapt their behaviors in accordance with Fuller's risk allostasis theory, aiming to mitigate risk to acceptable levels. The model was calibrated utilizing data from driving simulator scenarios involving both normal and distracted driving and naturalistic data, ensuring its sensitivity to diverse driving behaviors and adaptive behavioral changes. We investigated the model in terms of behavioral soundness and model fitting. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively incorporates endogenous mechanisms to explain both inter- and intra-driver heterogeneities in driving behavior. Additionally, it generates two plausible HF: risk-taking and behavior adaptation. The findings of this study suggest a step forward in achieving a more realistic representation of driving behavior adaptation and risk-taking strategies.</description>

      <title>The vector potential of a steady azimuthal current density. Once again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an integral expression for the vector potential of a time-independent, steady azimuthal current density. Our derivation is substantially simpler and somewhat more general than others given in the literature. As an illustration, we recover the results for the vector potential of a circular current loop as an orthogonal expansion in spherical and cylindrical coordinates. Additionally, we obtain closed analytical expressions for the vector potential and the magnetic induction of a circular current loop in terms of Legendre functions of the second kind, that are simpler than the results in terms of complete elliptic integrals given in textbooks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Shape Modelling of the Nasosinusal Anatomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human nose exhibits a huge variation in shape among individuals. All these variants alter the airflow through the nasal cavity and can impact how we smell odors. To acquire a better understanding of physiological and pathological functioning, it is important to study the effects of these modifications. SSM, or Statistical Shape Modelling, is a widely used methodology for considering morphological differences within a population. In the literature, only a few studies analyze nasal anatomy in its entirety, including paranasal sinuses, whose segmentation is particularly challenging due to their complexity and variability. This work aims at creating a highly accurate SSM for the nasosinusal complex. A traditional, greyscale thresholding-based segmentation approach was chosen, relying on Mimics software (Leuven, Belgium). 40 computed tomography (CT) datasets were considered. After segmentation, post-processing was performed to obtain watertight meshes using 3-Matic software (Leuven, Belgium), which was also used for the SSM generation. The generated model shows all relevant landmarks that typically characterize a nasosinual complex. 32 different modes are needed to explain 95% of the total variance. As a preliminary output, this study showed the feasibility and consistency of a statistical model of the nasosinusal anatomy. However, additional studies involving a larger sample size and a more robust validation process could be conducted.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed. The attached supplementary calculations provide detailed derivations of several formulas including the integral in the title and discuss the resemblance between the field line potential for tube and the electric potential for disk.</description>

      <title>Generalized causality constraint based on duality symmetry reveals untapped potential of sound absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality constraints are known to bind sound absorption to a limit that can only be achieved by optimizing the system bandwidth for a specific material thickness. This limit is defined on the assumption of a one-port system, generally causing duality symmetry to be overlooked. Here, we define a generalized causality constraint of sound absorption by investigating reflection and transmission of a two-port hybrid monopole-dipole resonator. With our theory, we show that the absorption limit is approached by relying on the well-established critical coupling as well as by matching effective compressibility and density. We experimentally show that the designed resonator absorbance follows the duality symmetry condition embodied in the large bandwidth reported. A comparison with a traditional foam liner and other competitive works further validates our findings, confirming an intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality. Our results untap unexplored absorption potential in broadband acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Equinoctial Elements and Rodrigues Parameters: A New Set of Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>
