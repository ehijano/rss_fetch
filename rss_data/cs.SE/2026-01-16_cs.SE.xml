      <title>Putting green software principles into practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need and theoretical methods for measuring and reducing CO2 emitted by computing systems are well understood, but real-world examples are still limited. We describe a journey towards green software for a live product running on a public cloud. We discuss practical solutions found, in particular using the cost implications of serverless systems to drive efficiency. We end with some `green software' principles that worked well in this project.</description>

      <title>A Governance Model for IoT Data in Global Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial IoT platforms in global manufacturing environments generate continuous operational data across production assets, utilities, and connected products. While data ingestion and storage capabilities have matured significantly, enterprises continue to face systemic challenges in governing IoT data at scale. These challenges are not rooted in tooling limitations but in the absence of a governance model that aligns with the realities of distributed operational ownership, heterogeneous source systems, and continuous change at the edge. This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations. The model addresses governance enforcement at architectural boundaries, enabling semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without requiring centralized control of operational technology systems. This work contributes a systems architecture and design framework grounded in analysis of manufacturing IoT requirements and constraints; empirical validation remains future work</description>

      <title>Enhancing Formal Software Specification with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal software specification is known to enable early error detection and explicit invariants, yet it has seen limited industrial adoption due to its high notation overhead and the expertise required to use traditional formal languages. This paper presents a case study showing that recent advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to retain many of the benefits of formal specification while substantially reducing these costs. The necessity of a clear distinction between what is controlled by the system analyst and can highly benefits from the rigor of formal specification and what need not be controlled is demonstrated. We use natural language augmented with lightweight mathematical notation and written in \LaTeX\ as an intermediate specification language, which is reviewed and refined by AI prior to code generation. Applied to a nontrivial simulation of organizational knowledge growth, this approach enables early validation, explicit invariants, and correctness by design, while significantly reducing development effort and producing a correct implementation on the first attempt.</description>

      <title>R-LAM: Reproducibility-Constrained Large Action Models for Scientific Workflow Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) extend large language models by enabling autonomous decision-making and tool execution, making them promising for automating scientific workflows. However, scientific workflows impose strict requirements on reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, which are not satisfied by generic LLM-based agents. Unconstrained action generation can lead to silent state changes, non-deterministic executions, and irreproducible experimental results, limiting the applicability of LAMs in scientific settings.
  In this paper, we propose R-LAM, a reproducibility-constrained framework for applying Large Action Models to scientific workflow automation. R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and explicit provenance tracking to ensure that every action and intermediate artifact is auditable and replayable. The framework supports failure-aware execution loops and controlled workflow forking, enabling iterative experimentation without compromising reproducibility.
  We implement R-LAM as a lightweight Python framework and release it as an open-source PyPI package to facilitate reproducible research. An experimental evaluation of representative scientific workflows demonstrates that R-LAM improves reproducibility success rates and execution reliability compared to unconstrained LLM-based agents, while retaining adaptive control over workflow execution.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Tool-Augmented LLM Task Solving Strategies in Scalable Multi-Agent Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to work well in question-answering scenarios, but real-world applications often require access to tools for live information or actuation. For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies. Both SAGE and the OPACA framework, as well as the different benchmark services and results, are available as Open Source/Open Data on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Investigating Tool-Memory Conflicts in Tool-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) have powered many applications. However, they are likely to suffer from knowledge conflict. In this paper, we propose a new type of knowledge conflict -- Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC), where the internal parametric knowledge contradicts with the external tool knowledge for tool-augmented LLMs. We find that existing LLMs, though powerful, suffer from TMC, especially on STEM-related tasks. We also uncover that under different conditions, tool knowledge and parametric knowledge may be prioritized differently. We then evaluate existing conflict resolving techniques, including prompting-based and RAG-based methods. Results show that none of these approaches can effectively resolve tool-memory conflicts.</description>

      <title>Explicating Tacit Regulatory Knowledge from LLMs to Auto-Formalize Requirements for Compliance Test Case Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance testing in highly regulated domains is crucial but largely manual, requiring domain experts to translate complex regulations into executable test cases. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation. Experiments across financial, automotive, and power domains show that RAFT achieves expert-level performance, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while reducing overall generation and review time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), complex Software Engineering (SE) tasks require more collaborative and specialized approaches. This concept paper systematically reviews the emerging paradigm of LLM-based multi-agent systems, examining their applications across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirements engineering and code generation to static code checking, testing, and debugging. We delve into a wide range of topics such as language model selection, SE evaluation benchmarks, state-of-the-art agentic frameworks and communication protocols. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and outline future research opportunities, with a focus on multi-agent orchestration, human-agent coordination, computational cost optimization, and effective data collection. This work aims to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights into the current forefront landscape of agentic systems within the software engineering domain.</description>

      <title>Adoption and Evolution of Code Style and Best Programming Practices in Open-Source Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following code style conventions in software projects is essential for maintaining overall code quality. Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.</description>

      <title>On Fun for Teaching Large Programming Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teaching software development basics to hundreds of students in a frontal setting is cost-efficient and thus still common in universities. However, in a large lecture hall, students can easily get bored, distracted, and disengaged. The frontal setting can also frustrate lecturers since interaction opportunities are limited and hard to scale. Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe. The results suggest that the fun activities can enable students to stay focused, remember key concepts, and reflect afterwards. However, keeping the activities concise and clearly linked to the concepts taught seems to be key to their acceptance and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Strict Rules: Assessing the Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Code Smell Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code smells are symptoms of potential code quality problems that may affect software maintainability, thus increasing development costs and impacting software reliability. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.</description>

      <title>Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</description>

      <title>S$^2$F: Principled Hybrid Testing With Fuzzing, Symbolic Execution, and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid testing that integrates fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling has demonstrated superior testing efficiency compared to individual techniques. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes. Notably, our tool uncovers three previously unknown crashes in real-world programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large programming courses struggle to provide timely, detailed feedback on student code. We developed Mark My Works, a local autograding system that combines traditional unit testing with LLM-generated explanations. The system uses role-based prompts to analyze submissions, critique code quality, and generate pedagogical feedback while maintaining transparency in its reasoning process.
  We piloted the system in a 191-student engineering course, comparing AI-generated assessments with human grading on 79 submissions. While AI scores showed no linear correlation with human scores (r = -0.177, p = 0.124), both systems exhibited similar left-skewed distributions, suggesting they recognize comparable quality hierarchies despite different scoring philosophies. The AI system demonstrated more conservative scoring (mean: 59.95 vs 80.53 human) but generated significantly more detailed technical feedback.</description>

      <title>Repository Intelligence Graph: Deterministic Architectural Map for LLM Code Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repository aware coding agents often struggle to recover build and test structure, especially in multilingual projects where cross language dependencies are encoded across heterogeneous build systems and tooling. We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.
  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\%, yielding a mean 57.8\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\% in accuracy and 69.5\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\% and 46.1\% in single language repositories. Qualitative analysis suggests that RIG shifts failures from structural misunderstandings toward reasoning mistakes over a correct structure, while rare regressions highlight that graph based reasoning quality remains a key factor.</description>

      <title>Towards Online Malware Detection using Process Resource Utilization Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the interconnection of computational resources, creating an environment where malicious software (malware) can spread rapidly. To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in scenarios with limited data availability, where traditional batch-based approaches often struggle to perform reliably.</description>

      <title>Agentic Pipelines in Embedded Software Engineering: Emerging Practices and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new transformation is underway in software engineering, driven by the rapid adoption of generative AI in development workflows. Similar to how version control systems once automated manual coordination, AI tools are now beginning to automate many aspects of programming. For embedded software engineering organizations, however, this marks their first experience integrating AI into safety-critical and resource-constrained environments. The strict demands for determinism, reliability, and traceability pose unique challenges for adopting generative technologies.
  In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study with ten senior experts from four companies who are evaluating generative AI-augmented development for embedded software. Through semi-structured focus group interviews and structured brainstorming sessions, we identified eleven emerging practices and fourteen challenges related to the orchestration, responsible governance, and sustainable adoption of generative AI tools. Our results show how embedded software engineering teams are rethinking workflows, roles, and toolchains to enable a sustainable transition toward agentic pipelines and generative AI-augmented development.</description>

      <title>Evolving with AI: A Longitudinal Analysis of Developer Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered coding assistants are rapidly becoming fixtures in professional IDEs, yet their sustained influence on everyday development remains poorly understood. Prior research has focused on short-term use or self-reported perceptions, leaving open questions about how sustained AI use reshapes actual daily coding practices in the long term. We address this gap with a mixed-method study of AI adoption in IDEs, combining longitudinal two-year fine-grained telemetry from 800 developers with a survey of 62 professionals. We analyze five dimensions of workflow change: productivity, code quality, code editing, code reuse, and context switching. Telemetry reveals that AI users produce substantially more code but also delete significantly more. Meanwhile, survey respondents report productivity gains and perceive minimal changes in other dimensions. Our results offer empirical insights into the silent restructuring of software workflows and provide implications for designing future AI-augmented tooling.</description>

      <title>Model See, Model Do? Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.</description>

      <title>Formal Safety Guarantees for Autonomous Vehicles using Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI technologies enable autonomous vehicles to perceive complex scenes, predict human behavior, and make real-time driving decisions. However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR-&gt;DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR-&gt;DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.</description>

      <title>MHub.ai: A Simple, Standardized, and Reproducible Platform for AI Models in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform medical imaging by automating image analysis and accelerating clinical research. However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Tables or Sankey Diagrams? Investigating User Interaction with Different Representations of Simulation Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding complex parameter dependencies is critical for effective configuration and maintenance of software systems across diverse domains - from Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) to cloud infrastructure and database management. However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance.</description>

      <title>Developer Interaction Patterns with Proactive AI: A Five-Day Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.</description>

      <title>Agent Skills in the Wild: An Empirical Study of Security Vulnerabilities at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p&lt;0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.</description>

      <title>An Extension-Based Accessibility Framework for Making Blockly Accessible to Blind and Low-Vision Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block-based programming environments (BBPEs) such as Scratch and Code.org are now widely used in K-12 computer science classes, but they remain mostly inaccessible to blind or visually impaired (BVI) learners. A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs.</description>

      <title>Developer Needs and Feasible Features for AI Assistants in IDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the increasing presence of AI assistants in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), it remains unclear what different groups of developers actually need from these tools and which features are likely to be implemented in practice. To investigate this gap, we conducted a two-phase study. First, we interviewed 35 professional developers from three user groups (Adopters, Churners, and Non-Users) to uncover unmet needs and expectations. Our analysis revealed five key areas of need distinctly distributed across practitioners' groups: Technology Improvement, Interaction, and Customization, as well as Simplifying Skill Building, and Programming Tasks. We then examined the feasibility of addressing selected needs through an internal prediction market involving 102 practitioners. The results demonstrate a strong alignment between the developers' needs and the practitioners' judgment for features focused on implementation and context awareness. However, features related to proactivity and maintenance remain both underestimated and technically unaddressed. Our findings reveal gaps in current AI support and provide practical directions for developing more effective and sustainable in-IDE AI systems</description>

      <title>Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environments: A Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is reshaping software development, fundamentally altering how developers interact with their tools. This shift marks the emergence of Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environment (in-IDE HAX), a field that explores the evolving dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction in AI-assisted coding environments. Despite rapid adoption, research on in-IDE HAX remains fragmented, which highlights the need for a unified overview of current practices, challenges, and opportunities. To provide a structured overview of existing research, we conduct a systematic literature review of 90 studies, summarizing current findings and outlining areas for further investigation.
  We organize key insights from reviewed studies into three aspects: Impact, Design, and Quality of AI-based systems inside IDEs. Impact findings show that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead and over-reliance. Design studies show that effective interfaces surface context, provide explanations and transparency of suggestion, and support user control. Quality studies document risks in correctness, maintainability, and security. For future research, priorities include productivity studies, design of assistance, and audit of AI-generated code. The agenda calls for larger and longer evaluations, stronger audit and verification assets, broader coverage across the software life cycle, and adaptive assistance under user control.</description>

      <title>On the Need to Rethink Trust in AI Assistants for Software Development: A Critical Review</title>

Abstract: Trust is a fundamental concept in human decision-making and collaboration that has long been studied in philosophy and psychology. However, software engineering (SE) articles often use the term trust informally; providing an explicit definition or embedding results in established trust models is rare. In SE research on AI assistants, this practice culminates in equating trust with the likelihood of accepting generated content, which, in isolation, does not capture the full conceptual complexity of trust. Without a common definition, true secondary research on trust is impossible. The objectives of our research were: (1) to present the psychological and philosophical foundations of human trust, (2) to systematically study how trust is conceptualized in SE and the related disciplines human-computer interaction and information systems, and (3) to discuss limitations of equating trust with content acceptance, outlining how SE research can adopt existing trust models to overcome the widespread informal use of the term trust. We conducted a literature review across disciplines and a critical review of recent SE articles with a focus on trust conceptualizations. We found that trust is rarely defined or conceptualized in SE articles. Related disciplines commonly embed their methodology and results in established trust models, clearly distinguishing, for example, between initial trust and trust formation and between appropriate and inappropriate trust. On a meta-scientific level, other disciplines even discuss whether and when trust can be applied to AI assistants at all. Our study reveals a significant maturity gap of trust research in SE compared to other disciplines. We provide concrete recommendations on how SE researchers can adopt established trust models and instruments to study trust in AI assistants beyond the acceptance of generated software artifacts.</description>

      <title>CodeAssistBench (CAB): Dataset &amp; Benchmarking for Multi-turn Chat-Based Code Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10646v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have improved dramatically, yet existing benchmarks still evaluate them in narrow code-generation settings. Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 7.22-16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&amp;A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents. The benchmark and pipeline are fully automated and publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/CodeAssistBench/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Smart Grid Information Exchanges: A Three-Phase Method for Evaluating Information and Data Models during their Development Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing process of smart grid digitalisation is increasing the volume of automated information exchange across distributed energy systems. This has driven the development of new information and data models when existing models fail to offer an optimal description of the requisite information due to be exchanged. To prevent potential operational disruption - i.e. in the provision of flexibility - caused by flaws in these newly designed models, it is essential to conduct evaluations during the development process before these models are deployed.
  Current practices differ across domains. Beyond smart grid applications, information models are evaluated through explicit reviews using quality characteristics. Within smart grid contexts, evaluation focuses on data models and implicit system-level conformance and interoperability testing. However, no existing approach combines these explicit and implicit evaluation methods for both information and data models during their development. This limits early fault detection and increases potential model correction costs.
  To address this gap, we propose a three-phase evaluation method based on design science research. Our method integrates explicit and implicit approaches, applies them to information and data models and is adaptable to various design stages. We also introduce a set of quality characteristics to support explicit model evaluation. Overall, our contribution enhances the reliability and interoperability of smart grid information exchange.</description>

      <title>STELP: Secure Transpilation and Execution of LLM-Generated Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</description>

      <title>Out of Distribution, Out of Luck: How Well Can LLMs Trained on Vulnerability Datasets Detect Top 25 CWE Weaknesses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet its real-world impact remains limited. Prior work found that current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20%-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). These issues create a significant generalization gap where models achieve misleading In-Distribution (ID) accuracies (testing on splits from the same dataset) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce BenchVul, which is a manually curated and balanced test dataset covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs, to enable fair model evaluation. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,548 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM pipeline. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) pipeline, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation reveals that In-Distribution (ID) performance does not reliably predict Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance on BenchVul. For example, a model trained on BigVul achieves the highest 0.703 ID accuracy but fails on BenchVul's real-world samples (0.493 OOD accuracy). Conversely, a model trained on our TitanVul achieves the highest OOD performance on both the real-world (0.881) and synthesized (0.785) portions of BenchVul, improving upon the next-best performing dataset by 5.3% and 11.8% respectively, despite a modest ID score (0.590). Augmenting TitanVul with our RVG further boosts this leading OOD performance, improving accuracy on real-world data by 5.8% (to 0.932).</description>

      <title>Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs.
  In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</description>

      <title>Sharpen the Spec, Cut the Code: A Case for Generative File System with SYSSPEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.
  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS demonstrates equivalent level of correctness to that of a manually-coded baseline across hundreds of regression tests. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</description>
