      <title>Certainly Bot Or Not? Trustworthy Social Bot Detection via Robust Multi-Modal Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bot detection is crucial for mitigating misinformation, online manipulation, and coordinated inauthentic behavior. While existing neural network-based detectors perform well on benchmarks, they struggle with generalization due to distribution shifts across datasets and frequently produce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution accounts beyond the training data. To address this, we introduce a novel Uncertainty Estimation for Social Bot Detection (UESBD) framework, which quantifies the predictive uncertainty of detectors beyond mere classification. For this task, we propose Robust Multi-modal Neural Processes (RMNP), which aims to enhance the robustness of multi-modal neural processes to modality inconsistencies caused by social bot camouflage. RMNP first learns unimodal representations through modality-specific encoders. Then, unimodal attentive neural processes are employed to encode the Gaussian distribution of unimodal latent variables. Furthermore, to avoid social bots stealing human features to camouflage themselves thus causing certain modalities to provide conflictive information, we introduce an evidential gating network to explicitly model the reliability of modalities. The joint latent distribution is learned through the generalized product of experts, which takes the reliability of each modality into consideration during fusion. The final prediction is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of the joint latent distribution followed by a decoder. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of RMNP in classification and uncertainty estimation, as well as its robustness to modality conflicts.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Social Media and Google Trends to Identify Waves of Avian Influenza Outbreaks in USA and Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) poses significant threats to the poultry industry, humans, domestic animals, and wildlife health worldwide. Monitoring this infectious disease is important for rapid and effective response to potential outbreaks. Conventional avian influenza surveillance systems have exhibited limitations in providing timely alerts for potential outbreaks. This study aimed to examine the idea of using online activity on social media, and Google searches to improve the identification of AIV in the early stage of an outbreak in a region. To this end, to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we collected historical data on online user activities from X (formerly known as Twitter) and Google Trends and assessed the statistical correlation of activities in a region with the AIV outbreak officially reported case numbers. In order to mitigate the effect of the noisy content on the outbreak identification process, large language models were utilized to filter out the relevant online activity on X that could be indicative of an outbreak. Additionally, we conducted trend analysis on the selected internet-based data sources in terms of their timeliness and statistical significance in identifying AIV outbreaks. Moreover, we performed an ablation study using autoregressive forecasting models to identify the contribution of X and Google Trends in predicting AIV outbreaks. The experimental findings illustrate that online activity on social media and search engine trends can detect avian influenza outbreaks, providing alerts earlier compared to official reports. This study suggests that real-time analysis of social media outlets and Google search trends can be used in avian influenza outbreak early warning systems, supporting epidemiologists and animal health professionals in informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>The Role of Organizations in Networked Mobilization: Examining the 2011 Chilean Student Movement Through The Logic of Connective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the communication mechanisms that shape the formation of digitally-enabled mobilization networks. Informed by the logic of connective action, we postulate that the emergence of networks enabled by organizations and individuals is differentiated by network and framing mechanisms. From a case comparison within two mobilization networks -- one crowd-enabled and one organizationally-enabled -- of the 2011 Chilean student movement, we analyze their network structures and users' communication roles. We found that organizationally-enabled networks are likely to form from hierarchical cascades and crowd-enabled networks are likely to form from triadic closure mechanisms. Moreover, we found that organizations are essential for both kinds of networks: compared to individuals, organizations spread more messages among unconnected users, and organizations' messages are more likely to be spread. We discuss our findings in light of the network mechanisms and participation of organizations and influential users.</description>

      <title>References to unbiased sources increase the helpfulness of community fact-checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community-based fact-checking is a promising approach to address misinformation on social media at scale. However, an understanding of what makes community-created fact-checks helpful to users is still in its infancy. In this paper, we analyze the determinants of the helpfulness of community-created fact-checks. For this purpose, we draw upon a unique dataset of real-world community-created fact-checks and helpfulness ratings from X's (formerly Twitter) Community Notes platform. Our empirical analysis implies that the key determinant of helpfulness in community-based fact-checking is whether users provide links to external sources to underpin their assertions. On average, the odds for community-created fact-checks to be perceived as helpful are 2.70 times higher if they provide links to external sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the helpfulness of community-created fact-checks varies depending on their level of political bias. Here, we find that community-created fact-checks linking to high-bias sources (of either political side) are perceived as significantly less helpful. This suggests that the rating mechanism on the Community Notes platform successfully penalizes one-sidedness and politically motivated reasoning. These findings have important implications for social media platforms, which can utilize our results to optimize their community-based fact-checking systems.</description>

      <title>Power Spectrum Signatures of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point signatures based on the Laplacian operators on graphs, point clouds, and manifolds have become popular tools in machine learning for graphs, clustering, and shape analysis. In this work, we propose a novel point signature, the power spectrum signature, a measure on $\mathbb{R}$ defined as the squared graph Fourier transform of a graph signal. Unlike eigenvectors of the Laplacian from which it is derived, the power spectrum signature is invariant under graph automorphisms. We show that the power spectrum signature is stable under perturbations of the input graph with respect to the Wasserstein metric. We focus on the signature applied to classes of indicator functions, and its applications to generating descriptive features for vertices of graphs. To demonstrate the practical value of our signature, we showcase several applications in characterizing geometry and symmetries in point cloud data, and graph regression problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamics of self-citations and their role in shaping scientific impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analyzing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indexes. Our results emphasise the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches in capturing the nuances of scientific impact.</description>

      <title>Social Media Harm Abatement: Mechanisms for Transparent Public Health Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have been accused of causing a range of harms, resulting in dozens of lawsuits across jurisdictions. These lawsuits are situated within the context of a long history of American product safety litigation, suggesting opportunities for remediation outside of financial compensation. Anticipating that at least some of these cases may be successful and/or lead to settlements, this article outlines an implementable mechanism for an abatement and/or settlement plan capable of mitigating abuse. The paper describes the requirements of such a mechanism, implications for privacy and oversight, and tradeoffs that such a procedure would entail. The mechanism is framed to operate at the intersection of legal procedure, standards for transparent public health assessment, and the practical requirements of modern technology products.</description>

      <title>On Densest $k$-Subgraph Mining and Diagonal Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem aims to find a subgraph comprising $k$ vertices with the maximum number of edges between them. A continuous reformulation of the binary quadratic D$k$S problem is considered, which incorporates a diagonal loading term. It is shown that this non-convex, continuous relaxation is tight for a range of diagonal loading parameters, and the impact of the diagonal loading parameter on the optimization landscape is studied. On the algorithmic side, two projection-free algorithms are proposed to tackle the relaxed problem, based on Frank-Wolfe and explicit constraint parametrization, respectively. Experiments suggest that both algorithms have merits relative to the state-of-art, while the Frank-Wolfe-based algorithm stands out in terms of subgraph density, computational complexity, and ability to scale up to very large datasets.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme considerably accelerates learning over the independent case, often performing similarly to a centralised learner while removing the restrictive assumption of the latter. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that our networked approach has significant advantages over both alternatives in terms of robustness to update failures and to changes in population size.</description>
