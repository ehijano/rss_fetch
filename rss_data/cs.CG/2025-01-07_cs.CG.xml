      <title>An Optimal Algorithm for Half-plane Hitting Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $ P $ of $n$ points and a set $ H $ of $n$ half-planes in the plane, we consider the problem of computing a smallest subset of points such that each half-plane contains at least one point of the subset. The previously best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^3 \log n)$ time. It is also known that $\Omega(n \log n)$ is a lower bound for the problem under the algebraic decision tree model. In this paper, we present an $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm, which matches the lower bound and thus is optimal. Another virtue of the algorithm is that it is relatively simple.</description>

      <title>Equichordal Points of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equichordal point problem is a classical question in geometry, asking whether there exist multiple equichordal points within a single convex body. An equichordal point is defined as a point through which all chords of the convex body have the same length. This problem, initially posed by Fujiwara and further investigated by Blaschke, Rothe, and Weitzenb\"ock, has remained an intriguing challenge, particularly in higher dimensions. In this paper, we rigorously prove the nonexistence of multiple equichordal points in $n$-dimensional convex bodies for $n \geq 2$. By utilizing topological tools such as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and analyzing the properties of continuous functions and mappings on convex bodies, we resolve this long-standing question.</description>

      <title>Expensive Homeomorphism of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the longstanding question of whether expansive homeomorphisms can exist within convex bodies in Euclidean spaces. Utilizing fundamental tools from topology, including the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, we establish the nonexistence of such mappings. Through an inductive approach based on dimension and the extension of boundary homeomorphisms, we demonstrate that expansive homeomorphisms are incompatible with the compact and convex structure of these bodies. This work highlights the interplay between topological principles and metric geometry, offering new insights into the constraints imposed by convexity.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Exact structures for persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss applications of exact structures and relative homological algebra to the study of invariants of multiparameter persistence modules. This paper is mostly expository, but does contain a pair of novel results. Over finite posets, classical arguments about the relative projective modules of an exact structure make use of Auslander-Reiten theory. One of our results establishes a new adjunction which allows us to ``lift'' these arguments to certain infinite posets over which Auslander-Reiten sequences do not always exist. We give several examples of this lifting, in particular highlighting the non-existence and existence of resolutions by upsets when working with finitely presentable representations of the plane and of the closure of the positive quadrant, respectively. We then restrict our attention to finite posets. In this setting, we discuss the relationship between the global dimension of an exact structure and the representation dimension of the incidence algebra of the poset. We conclude with our second novel contribution. This is an explicit description of the irreducible morphisms between relative projective modules for several exact structures which have appeared previously in the literature.</description>
