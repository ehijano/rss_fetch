      <title>Superflows around corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the dynamics of a two-dimensional superflow governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation passing over finite-size rectangular obstacles: an impenetrable wall and an impenetrable rectangular well. Extending classical studies of vortex nucleation around smooth obstacles, we focus on the role of sharp corners in determining the onset of vortex nucleation. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on the Schwarz-Christoffel methods for potential flow and on numerical simulations, we show that local velocity amplification near sharp corners crucially controls the critical flow velocity for vortex nucleation.
  For both wall and well configurations, we identify analytically and theoretically the critical velocities as a function of the obstacle width and its height or depth, finding an excellent agreement between the theory and our numerical simulations. Our results provide a simple framework for understanding superflow stability past finite-size obstacles with sharp features and are directly relevant to experimentally realizable configurations in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and related superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical methods, we study the formation of self-bound quantum Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures. We describe an attractive atomic Bose-Fermi mixture using quantum hydrodynamics enriched by beyond-mean-field corrections and thermal fluctuations, together with a simplified self-consistent Hartree-Fock model. With these models, we determine that low-temperature droplets with finite lifetimes can exist in free space when the attraction between bosons and fermions is sufficiently strong. Additionally, Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures can exist in a box potential in equilibrium with bosonic and fermionic vapor. We discuss the properties of Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures in terms of the initial condensate fraction, total atom number, and interspecies attraction strength.</description>

      <title>Controlling emergent dynamical behavior via phase-engineered strong symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry constraints provide a powerful means to control the dynamics of open quantum systems. However, the set of accessible control parameters is often limited. Here, we show that a tunable phase in the collective light-matter coupling of a cavity QED system induces a phase-dependent strong symmetry of the Liouvillian, enabling dynamical control of the open quantum system evolution. We demonstrate that tuning this phase substantially reduces the critical driving strength for dissipative phase transitions between stationary and non-stationary phases. We illustrate this mechanism in two experimentally relevant cavity QED settings: a two-species ensemble of two-level atoms and a single-species ensemble of three-level atoms. Our results establish phase control as a versatile tool for engineering dissipative phase transitions, with implications for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometry of Classical and Quantum Statistics in the Relativistic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic geometry of classical and quantum ideal gases in the relativistic regime, with particular emphasis on the effects of particle mass and spatial dimensionality. Relativistic kinematics is incorporated through the full energy-momentum dispersion relation and the corresponding relativistic density of states. Using the Fisher-Rao information metric derived from the partition function, we analyze the thermodynamic curvature for Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Exact analytical expressions are obtained in two spatial dimensions, while the three-dimensional case is studied numerically. We show that the thermodynamic curvature preserves its characteristic sign-positive for bosons and negative for fermions; even in the relativistic regime, reflecting effective attractive and repulsive statistical interactions, respectively. A distinctive relativistic effect is the shift of curvature singularities from the non-relativistic critical point to a mass-dependent threshold at $\mu=mc^{2}$. In addition, the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation temperature is evaluated, revealing explicit mass-dependent corrections to the non-relativistic result. These findings provide a unified geometric perspective on relativistic statistical systems and clarify the interplay between quantum statistics, relativistic kinematics, and critical behavior.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy Rydberg levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states of lanthanides are a promising, yet largely unexplored, playground for quantum studies. Here, we report on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy obtained by two-color trap depletion spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. The absolute excitation frequency of over 700 states with effective principal quantum number n between 21 and 130 is measured with an accuracy of 20 MHz. Most states are assigned to the 8 different series converging to the first 4f10(5I8)6s(2S1/2) J = 17/2 ionization potential. This energy is measured at EIP = 47901.8265 +/- 0.0008 cm-1, improving the precision of the literature value by over an order of magnitude. A multichannel quantum defect theory approach is used to benchmark and refine the assignments and to characterize six observed perturbing states belonging to higher ionization limits. These results pave the way for using dysprosium in Rydberg-based quantum architectures, leveraging the unique properties arising from its complex electronic structure. They also represent a compelling benchmark for ab-initio calculations of open-shell atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid state-resolved single-atom imaging of alkaline-earth fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Hilbert spaces with large dimension are of key interest for quantum information with applications in quantum computing and memories, quantum simulations and metrology. Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Is a phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the system is invariant under the $U(1)$ transformation $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}% \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)$, whereas the order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is not. However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the ground state is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results show that the answer to the question in the title is ``no''. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and different from it.</description>

      <title>Mott-insulating phases of the Bose-Hubbard model on quasi-1D ladder lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.</description>

      <title>The Huang-Yang formula for the low-density Fermi gas: upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. We derive an upper bound that agrees, at low density $\rho$, with the Huang-Yang conjecture. The latter captures the first three terms in an asymptotic low-density expansion, and in particular the Huang-Yang correction term of order $\rho^{7/3}$. Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.</description>

      <title>Dual-Spaces Invariance as a Universal Criterion for Identifying Multifractal Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Anderson localization physics, eigenstates of disordered quantum systems are commonly classified as extended, localized, or critical, distinguished by their distinct spatial structures in real space. While critical states are known to exhibit multifractal characteristics, a precise and operational criterion for characterizing critical states remains an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by revisiting criticality from a dual-spaces perspective that treats position and momentum representations on equal footing. Building on the Liu--Xia criterion, which characterizes critical states by the simultaneous vanishing of Lyapunov exponents ($\gamma=\gamma_m=0$) in both spaces, we show that this dual-spaces characterization captures an essential feature of critical states that is not limited to Lyapunov exponents. In particular, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inverse participation ratio exhibits closely related scaling behavior in position and momentum space for critical states. This position-momentum correspondence clearly distinguishes critical states from extended or localized ones, which instead display a pronounced asymmetry between the two representations. Our results establish a robust and universal framework for precisely characterizing multifractal critical states in disordered quantum systems, and provide practical guidance for their identification in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity with a quantum control field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. Despite an extensive history of theoretical explorations and proposals, QCAs have not been experimentally explored in the context of highly-scalable globally-controlled systems. Here we realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform multiple quantum protocols. Seeding an automaton with different initial states, we explore many-body dynamics of quasiparticles and grow GHZ states across both species, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. We further develop a second automaton using a novel mediated entangling gate, enabling generation of 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. Our results demonstrate that simple global controls enable access to a rich variety of applications through the QCA framework. The versatility and scalability of QCAs present compelling opportunities for the development of quantum information systems, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</description>
