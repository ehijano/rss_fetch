      <title>Learning in associative networks through Pavlovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. In addition, while mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that the Pavlovian neural and synaptic dynamics mechanisms give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule. In this paper, we show that we can analytically prove this result. Moreover, we obtain the Pavlovian dynamics directly with statistical mechanics considerations, so that we can model the whole process within the same framework. Then, we test and study the model in different numerical settings. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning.</description>

      <title>A simple theory for training response of deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks give us a powerful method to model the training dataset's relationship between input and output. We can regard that as a complex adaptive system consisting of many artificial neurons that work as an adaptive memory as a whole. The network's behavior is training dynamics with a feedback loop from the evaluation of the loss function. We already know the training response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal situations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other complex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very simple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some different factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training methods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of stochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally, we discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.</description>

      <title>Quenches in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is a prototype of a complex non-convex energy landscape. Dynamical processes evolving on such landscapes and locally aiming to reach minima are generally poorly understood. Here, we study quenches, i.e. dynamics that locally aim to decrease energy. We analyse the energy at convergence for two distinct algorithmic classes, single-spin flip and synchronous dynamics, focusing on greedy and reluctant strategies. We provide precise numerical analysis of the finite size effects and conclude that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the reluctant algorithm is compatible with converging to the ground state energy density, while the greedy strategy is not. Inspired by the single-spin reluctant and greedy algorithms, we investigate two synchronous time algorithms, the sync-greedy and sync-reluctant algorithms. These synchronous processes can be analysed using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), and a new backtracking version of DMFT. Notably, this is the first time the backtracking DMFT is applied to study dynamical convergence properties in fully connected disordered models. The analysis suggests that the sync-greedy algorithm can also achieve energies compatible with the ground state, and that it undergoes a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Josephson threshold detector in the phase diffusion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the performance of threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions can be significantly improved by exploiting the phase diffusion regime. When the escape dynamics of the detector switches to this regime, a decrease in both - dark count rate and the standard deviation of switching current is simultaneously observed. However, this effect is essential for (i) critical currents below 100 nA, and (ii) temperatures of the order of several hundreds millikelvin. Importantly that for such detectors optimal performance occurs at finite temperatures, making the microwave single photon detection feasible even in the sub-K range. Possible explanation of these findings is discussed.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Disorder free many-body localization transition in two quasiperiodically coupled Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder free many-body localization (MBL) can occur in interacting systems that can dynamically generate their own disorder. We address the thermal-MBL phase transition of two isotropic Heisenberg spin chains that are quasi-periodically coupled to each other. The spin chains are incommensurate and are coupled through a short range exchange interaction of the $XXZ$ type that decays exponentially with the distance. Using exact diagonalization, matrix product states and density matrix renormalization group, we calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy at long times and extract the inverse participation ratio in the thermodynamic limit. We show that this system has a robust MBL phase. We establish the phase diagram with the onset of MBL as a function of the interchain exchange coupling and of the incommensuration between the spin chains. The Ising limit of the interchain interaction optimizes the stability of the MBL phase over a broad range of incommensurations above a given critical exchange coupling. Incorporation of interchain spin flips significantly enhances entanglement between the spin chains and produces delocalization, favoring a pre-thermal phase whose entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

      <title>Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>The Role of Pseudo-labels in Self-training Linear Classifiers on High-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning method. However, why and how ST improves generalization performance by using potentially erroneous pseudo-labels is still not well understood. To deepen the understanding of ST, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss on binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The results show that ST improves generalization in different ways depending on the number of iterations. When the number of iterations is small, ST improves generalization performance by fitting the model to relatively reliable pseudo-labels and updating the model parameters by a large amount at each iteration. This suggests that ST works intuitively. On the other hand, with many iterations, ST can gradually improve the direction of the classification plane by updating the model parameters incrementally, using soft labels and small regularization. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can extract information from the data in an almost noiseless way. However, in the presence of label imbalance, the generalization performance of ST underperforms supervised learning with true labels. To overcome this, two heuristics are proposed to enable ST to achieve nearly compatible performance with supervised learning even with significant label imbalance.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in driven-dissipative disordered many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum jumps affect localized regimes in driven-dissipative disordered many-body systems featuring a localization transition. We introduce a deformation of the Lindblad master equation that interpolates between the standard Lindblad and the no-jump non-Hermitian dynamics of open quantum systems. As a platform, we use a disordered chain of hard-core bosons with nearest-neighbor interactions and subject to incoherent drive and dissipation at alternate sites. We probe both the statistics of complex eigenvalues of the deformed Liouvillian and dynamical observables of physical relevance. We show that reducing the number of quantum jumps, achievable through realistic postselection protocols, can promote the emergence of the localized phase. Our findings are based on exact diagonalization and time-dependent matrix-product states techniques.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>
