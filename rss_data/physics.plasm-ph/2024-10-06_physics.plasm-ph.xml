      <title>Neutral pressure measurement in TCV tokamak using ASDEX-type pressure gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the neutral gas distribution at the edge of magnetic confinement fusion devices is critical for divertor physics studies. In the TCV tokamak, a set of ASDEX-type hot ionization pressure gauges (APGs) has been installed for fast, in-situ measurements of the neutral pressure distribution in the TCV chamber. The APGs have been calibrated against baratron pressure gauges (BGs) for pressures ranging from less than 1 mPa to several hundred mPa. A correction to account for the residual pressure in the pumped torus is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy. APG measurements in a series of plasma discharges with varied density ramp rates are analyzed, and are compared with the pressure measurements of the existing BGs. APG measurements feature significantly higher time resolution and faster time response than the BGs, and extend the measurement range to lower pressures. APGs systematically measure higher neutral pressures than the BGs connected to the same TCV port, likely due to the BG time delay and slow time response and nonuniform neutral distribution in gauge ports during the discharge. The initial APG operations in TCV have been proven successful, which validates the APG as an adequate pressure measurement technique for the upcoming TCV divertor upgrades.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Relativistic Particle Pushers vis-\`a-vis Computation Time &amp; Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of relativistic particle pushers has long been a topic of interest in the field of computational plasma physics, particularly from the point of view of the particle-in-cell approach. Previous works undertaken to compare such integrators have predominantly targeted the ultra-relativistic regime. In this paper, we utilize a custom-built code to study the core run-times of the Boris, the Vay, and the Higuera-Cary particle pushers for low-, high-, and ultra-relativistic particles. This is followed by a comparison of the three integrators in terms of accuracy and error. A fitness parameter is then proposed that can serve as a one-stop value to determine which method is more suitable for a particular simulation setup. It is hoped that through knowledge of such intricacies, the choice for the integrator will be easier to make depending on the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Reduced modeling of scrape-off losses of runaway electrons during tokamak disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of runaway electron generation and losses during tokamak disruptions is crucial for the development of reactor-scale tokamak devices. In this paper we present a reduced model for runaway electron losses due to flux surface scrape-off caused by the vertical motion of the plasma. The model is made compatible with computationally inexpensive one-dimensional models averaging over a fixed flux-surface geometry, by formulating it as a loss term outside an estimated time-varying minor radius of the last closed flux surface. We then implement this model in the disruption modeling tool DREAM, and demonstrate its impact on selected scenarios relevant for ITER. Our results indicate that scrape-off losses may be crucial for making complete runaway avoidance possible even in a $15\,\rm MA$ DT H-mode ITER scenario. The results are however sensitive to the details of the runaway electron generation and phenomena affecting the current density profile, such as the current profile relaxation at the beginning of the disruption.</description>

      <title>Enhancement to Fusion Reactivity in Sheared Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sheared flow increases the reactivity of fusion plasma. In unmagnetized DT plasma with flow gradients comparable to the mean free path of reacting ions, reactivity can be more than doubled. Neutron spectra are modified, helping to explain anomalous observations. The reactivity enhancement is particularly relevant in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where it allows turbulent kinetic energy to contribute to the fusion burn even before thermalizing. In high-yield ICF experiments, the effect is most pronounced before bang time, suggesting a new mechanism for fast ignition.</description>

      <title>First-principles measurement of ion and electron energization in collisionless accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the largest 3D Particle-in-Cell shearing-box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability, for the first time employing the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio. We investigate the energy partition between relativistically hot electrons and subrelativistic ions in turbulent accretion flows, a regime relevant to collisionless, radiatively inefficient accretion flows of supermassive black holes, such as those targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope. We provide a simple empirical formula to describe the measured heating ratio between ions and electrons, which can be used for more accurate global modeling of accretion flows with standard fluid approaches such as general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>
