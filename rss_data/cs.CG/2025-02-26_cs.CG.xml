      <title>Tight Bounds on the Number of Closest Pairs in Vertical Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \geq 2$ is a constant, and let $H_1,H_2,\ldots,H_{m+1}$ be a sequence of vertical hyperplanes that are sorted by their first coordinates, such that exactly $n/m$ points of $S$ are between any two successive hyperplanes. Let $|A(S,m)|$ be the number of different closest pairs in the ${{m+1} \choose 2}$ vertical slabs that are bounded by $H_i$ and $H_j$, over all $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq m+1$. We prove tight bounds for the largest possible value of $|A(S,m)|$, over all point sets of size $n$, and for all values of $1 \leq m \leq n$.
  As a result of these bounds, we obtain, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, a data structure of size $O(n)$, such that for any vertical query slab $Q$, the closest pair in the set $Q \cap S$ can be reported in $O(n^{1/2+\epsilon})$ time. Prior to this work, no linear space data structure with sublinear query time was known.</description>

      <title>Apex Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a zigzag filtration, we want to find its barcode representatives, i.e., a compatible choice of bases for the homology groups that diagonalize the linear maps in the zigzag. To achieve this, we convert the input zigzag to a levelset zigzag of a real-valued function. This function generates a Mayer-Vietoris pyramid of spaces, which generates an infinite strip of homology groups. We call the origins of indecomposable (diamond) summands of this strip their apexes and give an algorithm to find representative cycles in these apexes from ordinary persistence computation. The resulting representatives map back to the levelset zigzag and thus yield barcode representatives for the input zigzag. Our algorithm for lifting a $p$-dimensional cycle from ordinary persistence to an apex representative takes $O(p \cdot m \log m)$ time. From this we can recover zigzag representatives in time $O(\log m + C)$, where $C$ is the size of the output.</description>

      <title>Exact Algorithms for Minimum Dilation Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a spectrum of new theoretical insights and practical results for finding a Minimum Dilation Triangulation (MDT), a natural geometric optimization problem of considerable previous attention: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, find a triangulation $T$, such that a shortest Euclidean path in $T$ between any pair of points increases by the smallest possible factor compared to their straight-line distance. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for the problem; moreover, evaluating the objective function involves computing the sum of (possibly many) square roots. On the other hand, the problem is not known to be NP-hard.
  (1) We provide practically robust methods and implementations for computing an MDT for benchmark sets with up to 30,000 points in reasonable time on commodity hardware, based on new geometric insights into the structure of optimal edge sets. Previous methods only achieved results for up to $200$ points, so we extend the range of optimally solvable instances by a factor of $150$.
  (2) We develop scalable techniques for accurately evaluating many shortest-path queries that arise as large-scale sums of square roots, allowing us to certify exact optimal solutions, with previous work relying on (possibly inaccurate) floating-point computations.
  (3) We resolve an open problem by establishing a lower bound of $1.44116$ on the dilation of the regular $84$-gon (and thus for arbitrary point sets), improving the previous worst-case lower bound of $1.4308$ and greatly reducing the remaining gap to the upper bound of $1.4482$ from the literature. In the process, we provide optimal solutions for regular $n$-gons up to $n = 100$.</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on plane 4-graphs, that is, planar graphs of maximum degree 4 whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size 2. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Distance Distributions for detecting near-duplicates in large materials databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real objects are often given as discrete sets of points such as corners or other salient features. For our main applications in chemistry, points represent atomic centers in a molecule or a solid material. We study the problem of classifying discrete (finite and periodic) sets of unordered points under isometry, which is any transformation preserving distances in a metric space.
  Experimental noise motivates the new practical requirement to make such invariants Lipschitz continuous so that perturbing every point in its epsilon-neighborhood changes the invariant up to a constant multiple of epsilon in a suitable distance satisfying all metric axioms. Because given points are unordered, the key challenge is to compute all invariants and metrics in a near-linear time of the input size.
  We define the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD) for any discrete set and prove in addition to the properties above the completeness of PDD for all periodic sets in general position. The PDD can compare nearly 1.5 million crystals from the world's four largest databases within 2 hours on a modest desktop computer. The impact is upholding data integrity in crystallography because the PDD will not allow anyone to claim a `new' material as a noisy disguise of a known crystal.</description>

      <title>A Purely Geometric Variant of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale--Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$ to its opposite. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n/3$. Moreover, this can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>
