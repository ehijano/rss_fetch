      <title>The Noncomputability of Immune Reaction Complexity: Algorithmic Information Gaps under Effective Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a validity-filtered, certificate-based view of reactions grounded in Algorithmic Information Theory. A fixed, total, input-blind executor maps a self-delimiting advice string to a candidate response, accepted only if a decidable or semi-decidable validity predicate V(x, r) holds. The minimum feasible realizer complexity M(x) = min_{r: V(x,r)=1} K(r), with K denoting prefix Kolmogorov complexity, measures the minimal information required for a valid outcome. We define the Normalized Advice Quantile (NAQ) as the percentile of M(x) across a reference pool, yielding a scale-free hardness index on [0, 1] robust to the choice of universal machine and comparable across task families. An Exact Realizer Identity shows that the minimal advice for any input-blind executor equals M(x) up to O(1), while a description plus selection upper bound refines it via computable feature maps, separating description cost K(y) from selection cost log i_y(x). In finite-ambiguity regimes M(x) approximately equals min_y K(y); in generic-fiber regimes the bound is tight. NAQ is quasi-invariant under bounded enumeration changes. An operational converse links NAQ to rate-distortion: communicating advice with error epsilon requires average length near the entropy of target features. Extensions include a resource-bounded variant NAQ_t incorporating time-penalized complexity (Levin's Kt) and an NP-style setting showing linear worst-case advice n - O(1). Finally, a DKW bound guarantees convergence of empirical NAQ estimates, enabling data-driven calibration via compressor-based proxies.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Near-Optimal Performance of the Synchronous Nyquist-Folding Generalized Eigenvalue Method (SNGEM) for Sub-Nyquist Multi-Tone Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronous Nyquist folding generalized eigenvalue method (SNGEM) realizes full frequency/amplitude/phase estimation of multitone signals at extreme sub-Nyquist rates by jointly processing the original signals and their time derivatives. In this paper, accurate Cramer-Rao bounds for amplitude ratio parameter R=A/B=1/(2\pif) are derived for two channels with equal SNR. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm that SNGEM achieves machine accuracy in noise-free conditions and closely approaches the derived CRB at all SNR levels, even at 10- 20x compression, whereas classical compressive sensing OMP exhibits irreducible error flattening due to DFT grid bias and aliasing noise. These results establish SNGEM as a statistically nearly optimal deterministic sub-Nyquist parameter spectrum analysis</description>

      <title>Power consumption Reduction in ELAA-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power consumption reduction in extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. Although ELAAs are critical for achieving high-resolution near-field sensing, fully activating all antenna elements in conventional digital architectures leads to prohibitive power demands. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient subarray activation framework that selects an optimal subset of subarrays to minimize the total power consumption, subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for both sensing and communication. We formulate a novel optimization problem and solve it using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining dual-function performance.</description>

      <title>Deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel in which at most $t$ deletions may occur. We propose an explicit construction of $q$-ary codes of length $n$ for this channel with $2t\log_q n+\Theta(\log\log n)$ redundant symbols. We also show that the optimal redundancy is between $t\log_q n+\Omega(1)$ and $2t\log_q n-\log_q\log_2 n+O(1)$, so our explicit construction matches the existential upper bound to first order. In contrast, for the classical adversarial $q$-ary deletion channel, the smallest redundancy achieved by known explicit constructions that correct up to $t$ deletions is $4t(1+\epsilon)\log_q n+o(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation with Quantum Messages for Symmetric Q-ary Pure-State Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) provides a low-complexity alternative to collective measurements for communication over classical--quantum channels. Prior BPQM constructions and density-evolution (DE) analyses have focused on binary alphabets. Here, we generalize BPQM to symmetric q-ary pure-state channels (PSCs) whose output Gram matrix is circulant. For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities. This provides a DE framework for symmetric q-ary PSCs that allows one to estimate BPQM decoding thresholds for LDPC codes and to construct polar codes on these channels.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Sensor Scheduling for Delay-Aware and Stable Remote State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictable sensor-to-estimator delays fundamentally distort what matters for wireless remote state estimation: not just freshness, but how delay interacts with sensor informativeness and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Transversal gates for quantum CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of computing the set of diagonal transversal gates fixing a CSS code. We determine the logical actions of the gates as well as the groups of transversal gates that induce non-trivial logical gates and logical identities. We explicitly declare the set of equations defining the groups, a key advantage and differentiator of our approach. We compute the complete set of transversal stabilizers and transversal gates for any CSS code arising from monomial codes, a family that includes decreasing monomial codes and polar codes. As a consequence, we recover and extend some results in the literature on CSS-T codes, triorthogonal codes, and divisible codes.</description>

      <title>Subjective Distortion: Achievability and Outer Bounds for Distortion Functions with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some rate-distortion-type problems, the required fidelity of information is affected by past actions. As a result, the distortion function depends not only on the instantaneous distortion between a source symbol and its representation symbol, but also on past representations. In this paper, we give a formal definition of this problem and introduce both inner (achievable) and outer bounds on the rate-distortion tradeoff. We also discuss convexification of the problem, which makes it easier to find bounds. Problems of this type arise in biological information processing, as well as in recommendation engines; we provide an example applied to a simplified biological information processing problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Privacy of Sequential Data Releases Under Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility remains an active area of research. Our contribution is motivated by two observations. First, privacy mechanisms developed for one-time data release cannot straightforwardly be extended to sequential releases. Second, practical databases are likely to be useful to multiple distinct parties. Furthermore, we can not rule out the possibility of data sharing between parties. With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility. Finally, we discuss how our findings may extend to applications in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Martingale Estimators: Structured Estimators for Maximizing Information Freshness in Query-Based Update Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.</description>

      <title>The augmented NLP bound for maximum-entropy remote sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum-entropy remote sampling problem (MERSP) is to select a subset of s random variables from a set of n random variables, so as to maximize the information concerning a set of target random variables that are not directly observable. We assume throughout that the set of all of these random variables follows a joint Gaussian distribution, and that we have the covariance matrix available. Finally, we measure information using Shannon's differential entropy.
  The main approach for exact solution of moderate-sized instances of MERSP has been branch-and-bound, and so previous work concentrated on upper bounds. Prior to our work, there were two upper-bounding methods for MERSP: the so-called NLP bound and the spectral bound, both introduced 25 years ago. We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound. In addition, the augmented NLP formulation allows us to derive upper bounds for rank-deficient covariance matrices when they satisfy a technical condition. This is in contrast to the earlier work on the ordinary NLP bound that worked with only positive definite covariance matrices. Finally, we introduce a novel and very effective diagonal-scaling technique for MERSP, employing a positive vector of parameters. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in advancing the state of the art for calculating upper bounds on MERSP.</description>

      <title>Sparse Grassmannian Design for Noncoherent Codes via Schubert Cell Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for designing sparse Grassmannian codes for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output systems. Conventional pairwise error probability formulations under uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels fail to account for rank deficiency induced by sparse configurations. We revise these formulations to handle such cases in a unified manner. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form metric that effectively maximizes the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI) at a given signal-to-noise ratio. We focus on the fact that the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmann manifold provides a mathematically sparse property, and establish design criteria for sparse noncoherent codes based on our analyses. In numerical results, the proposed sparse noncoherent codes outperform conventional methods in terms of both symbol error rate and AMI, and asymptotically approach the performance of the optimal Grassmannian constellations in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime. Moreover, they reduce the time and space complexity, which does not scale with the number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of weight enumerators for codes generated by an integral matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of error-correcting codes, the minimum weight and the weight enumerator play a crucial role in evaluating the error-correcting capacity. In this paper, by viewing the weight enumerator as a quasi-polynomial, we reduce the calculation of the minimum weight to that of a code over a smaller integer residue ring. We also give a transformation formula between the Tutte quasi-polynomial and the weight enumerator. Furthermore, we compute the number of maximum weight codewords for the codes related to the matroids $N_k$ and $Z_k$. This is equivalent to computing the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the hyperplane arrangements related to $N_k$ and $Z_k$.</description>

      <title>Thompson sampling: Precise arm-pull dynamics and adaptive inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.
  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.
  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.
  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic H\"ormander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.</description>

      <title>Lossy Common Information in a Learnable Gray-Wyner Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Decentralized Self-Regulating Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-regulating random walks (SRRWs) are decentralized token-passing processes on a graph allowing nodes to locally \emph{fork}, \emph{terminate}, or \emph{pass} tokens based only on a return-time \emph{age} statistic. We study SRRWs on a finite connected graph under a lazy reversible walk, with exogenous \emph{trap} deletions summarized by the absorption pressure $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}=\sum_{u\in\mathcal P_{\mathrm{trap}}}\zeta(u)\pi(u)$ and a global per-visit fork cap $q$. Using exponential envelopes for return-time tails, we build graph-dependent Laplace envelopes that universally bound the stationary fork intensity of any age-based policy, leading to an effective triggering age $A_{\mathrm{eff}}$. A mixing-based block drift analysis then yields controller-agnostic stability limits: any policy that avoids extinction and explosion must satisfy a \emph{viability} inequality (births can overcome $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}$ at low population) and a \emph{safety} inequality (trap deletions plus deliberate terminations dominate births at high population). Under corridor-wise versions of these conditions, we obtain positive recurrence of the population to a finite corridor.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Bosonic MAC: Achievable Rates and Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \(O(\sqrt{n} \log n)\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Dimension-Free Convergence and Loss-Adaptive Schedules for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Optimization for Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.</description>

      <title>OD-Stega: LLM-Based Relatively Secure Steganography via Optimized Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to generate stego-texts in combination with arithmetic coding. An efficient method should embed secret bits in as few language tokens as possible while keeping the stego-text as natural as possible. We show that this problem is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the divergence between the new distribution and the original one produced by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided under either the KL divergence or the total variation constraint. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The incorporation of the proposed approach with existing (potentially non arithmetic coding based) techniques, e.g., the Discop technique.</description>

      <title>Edge Collaborative Gaussian Splatting with Integrated Rendering and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS), where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO) algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution capability of ILO.</description>

      <title>Cross-Band Channel Impulse Response Prediction: Leveraging 3.5 GHz Channels for Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate cross-band channel prediction is essential for 6G networks, particularly in the upper mid-band (FR3, 7-24 GHz), where penetration loss and blockage are severe. Although ray tracing (RT) provides high-fidelity modeling, it remains computationally intensive, and high-frequency data acquisition is costly. To address these challenges, we propose CIR-UNext, a deep learning framework designed to predict 7 GHz channel impulse responses (CIRs) by leveraging abundant 3.5 GHz CIRs. The framework integrates an RT-based dataset pipeline with attention U-Net (AU-Net) variants for gain and phase prediction. The proposed AU-Net-Aux model achieves a median gain error of 0.58 dB and a phase prediction error of 0.27 rad on unseen complex environments. Furthermore, we extend CIR-UNext into a foundation model, Channel2ComMap, for throughput prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating superior performance compared with existing approaches. Overall, CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization, beam management, digital twins, and intelligent resource allocation in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Expectations in Expectation Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new variant of variable-length source coding for sending a source over two parallel channels, one of which is costly and the other free. We give a complete solution to this problem. Next, we relate the problem to the number partitioning problem, which is the task of dividing a given list of numbers into a pre-specified number of subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is as nearly equal as possible. We introduce two new objective functions for this problem and show that an adapted version of the Huffman coding algorithm (with a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for input size $n$) produces the optimal solution for one objective function, and a nearly optimal solution for the other objective function.</description>

      <title>Neural Window Decoder for SC-LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural window decoder (NWD) for spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes. The proposed NWD retains the conventional window decoder (WD) process but incorporates trainable neural weights. To train the weights of NWD, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, we restrict the loss function to target variable nodes (VNs) of the window, which prunes the neural network and accordingly enhances training efficiency. Second, we employ the active learning technique with a normalized loss term to prevent the training process from biasing toward specific training regions. Next, we develop a systematic method to derive non-uniform schedules for the NWD based on the training results. We introduce trainable damping factors that reflect the relative importance of check node (CN) updates. By skipping updates with less importance, we can omit $\mathbf{41\%}$ of CN updates without performance degradation compared to the conventional WD. Lastly, we address the error propagation problem inherent in SC-LDPC codes by deploying a complementary weight set, which is activated when an error is detected in the previous window. This adaptive decoding strategy effectively mitigates error propagation without requiring modifications to the code and decoder structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the recently obtained optimality criterion (A.S. Holevo, Lobachevskii J. Math., \textbf{43}:7 (2022), 1646-1650), when applied to specific ensembles of states leads to nontrivial tight entropy inequalities that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) (B.-G. Englert and J. \v{R}eh\'{a}\v{c}ek, J. Mod. Optics \textbf{57 }N3 (2010) 218-226) is reconsidered and the corresponding entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also an approach to the proof of the conjectures concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids.</description>

      <title>POLAR: A Pessimistic Model-based Policy Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare, education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training performance or provide guarantees only for an oracle policy, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Cellular, Cell-less, and Everything in Between: A Unified Framework for Utility Region Analysis in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless networks, with a focus on signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into interference patterns of modern network architectures, including extremely large MIMO and cell-less networks. A central contribution is a simple characterization of feasible utility regions using the concept of spectral radius of nonlinear mappings. This characterization provides a powerful mathematical tool for wireless system design and analysis. For example, it allows us to generalize existing characterizations of the weak Pareto boundary using compact notation. It also allows us to derive tractable sufficient conditions for the identification of convex utility regions. This property is particularly important because, on the weak Pareto boundary, it guarantees that time sharing (or user grouping) cannot simultaneously improve the utilities of all users. Beyond geometrical insights, these sufficient conditions have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate maximization problems that are inherently convex, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide justification for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the beamforming strategy.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</description>

      <title>Increasing Data Rate through Shaping on Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of cellular systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low-density parity check (LDPC) coding for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. We focus on improving performance of wireless transmission with rate $3/4$ LDPC codes employing $4$-QAM at the cell edge. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We emphasize that the shaping code is also used to transmit information. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. Our results suggest that it is better to increase rate at the cell edge by introducing shaping, rather than by increasing the rate of the LDPC code.</description>

      <title>Three results on twisted $G-$codes and skew twisted $G-$codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>
