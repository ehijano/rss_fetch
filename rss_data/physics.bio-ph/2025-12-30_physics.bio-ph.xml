      <title>A critical review of nanoplastic bioaccumulation data and a unified toxicokinetic model: from teleosts to human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoplastics (NP) are now detected in human blood and organs at concentrations reaching hundreds to thousands of parts per million, yet no quantitative framework has linked short-term laboratory uptake kinetics to long-term, organ-specific bioaccumulation in humans. Here we develop a minimal, mechanistically grounded toxicokinetic model that represents organisms as a sequential two-compartment system comprising a systemic gate-blood compartment governing entry and circulation, and organ-level tissue compartments controlling retention. Reanalysis of six independent uptake and depuration datasets in teleost fish (spanning four species, multiple organs, particle sizes from 20 to 500~nm, and exposure concentrations across four orders of magnitude) reveals a striking data collapse when expressed in normalized variables. This collapse shows that uptake dynamics are universally governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the systemic excretion capacity, which is generically small under experimental conditions, implying prolonged systemic residence of NP. Exploiting the scale-free structure of the model, we extrapolate these kinetics to humans and demonstrate that direct exposure from air and water cannot account for reported organ burdens, even under conservative assumptions of negligible clearance. Instead, mass-balance constraints identify dietary intake as the dominant pathway for systemic loading. At steady state, human organ concentrations follow a robust cubic scaling with tissue lipid fraction, yielding blood-to-brain enrichment factors of order $10^{3}$--$10^{4}$. This lipid-mediated enrichment, combined with inefficient systemic depuration, explains why the brain emerges as a dominant sink for environmental nanoplastics. Our results establish a unified, predictive toxicokinetic framework that quantitatively bridges short-term animal experiments and chronic human bioaccumulation.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Architecture of Living Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.
  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new analytical potential function to model proton transfer in the adenine-thymine base pair and develop a non-adiabatic quantum mechanical framework to calculate genetic mutation probabilities. This potential has been used to calculate the probability of mutation in a non-adiabatic process. The results of the new model have been shown to be consistent with the findings of other researchers.</description>

      <title>Viral Evolution Under Physical Constraints: Decay, Mutation, and Transmission as a Constrained Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viruses display striking diversity in structure, transmission mode, immune interaction, and evolutionary behavior. Despite this diversity, viral strategies are not unconstrained. Here we present a unifying framework that treats viral evolution as a problem of constrained optimization governed by physical decay, immune pressure, mutation robustness, and transmission architecture. We model virions as multi-component physical systems subject to irreversible environmental failure and viruses as replicators operating under immune-driven selection and mutation-selection balance. Within this framework, major viral transmission strategies arise as necessary solutions rather than taxonomic accidents. Environmentally transmitted and airborne viruses are predicted to be structurally simple, chemically stable, and reliant on replication volume rather than immune suppression. Structurally complex viruses tolerate rapid environmental decay by encoding immune-modulatory machinery, latency, or persistent replication, at the cost of reduced mutation robustness. Temperature-dependent seasonality emerges naturally from the thermally activated nature of viral decay, without invoking host behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biological networks the responses of individual elements are ambiguous. We consider a scenario in which many sensors respond to a shared signal, each with limited information capacity, and ask that the outputs together convey as much information as possible about an underlying relevant variable. In a low noise limit where we can make analytic progress, we show that individually ambiguous responses optimize overall information transmission.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Neuroscience for AI: How integrating Actions, Compositional Structure and Episodic Memory could enable Safe, Interpretable and Human-Like AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic state encodes locus-specific chromatin mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromatin is repeatedly deformed in vivo during transcription, nuclear remodeling, and confined migration - yet how mechanical response varies from locus to locus, and how it relates to epigenetic state, remains unclear. We develop a theory to infer locus-specific viscoelasticity from three-dimensional genome organization. Using chromatin structures derived from contact maps, we calculate frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli for individual loci and establish that the mechanical properties are determined both by chromatin epigenetic marks and organization. On large length scales, chromatin exhibits Rouse-like viscoelastic scaling, but this coarse behavior masks extensive heterogeneity at the single-locus level. Loci segregate into two mechanical subpopulations with distinct longest relaxation times: one characterized by single-timescale and another by multi-timescale relaxation. The multi-timescale loci are strongly enriched in active marks, and the longest relaxation time for individual loci correlates inversely with effective local stiffness. Pull-release simulations further predict a time-dependent susceptibility: H3K27ac-rich loci deform more under sustained forcing yet can resist brief, large impulses. At finer genomic scales, promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies emerge as "viscoelastic islands" aligned with their focal interactions. Together, these results suggest that chromatin viscoelasticity is an organized, epigenetically coupled property of the 3D genome, providing a mechanistic layer that may influence enhancer-promoter communication, condensate-mediated organization, and response to cellular mechanical stress. The prediction that locus-specific mechanics in chromatin are controlled by 3D structures as well as the epigenetic states is amenable to experimental test.</description>

      <title>Myofibroblasts slow down defect recombination dynamics in mixed cell monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular organization and mechanotransduction pathways are crucial regulators of tissue morphogenesis, whereas their dysregulation contributes to pathologies. Overactive fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, are key drivers of fibrosis, yet how their presence alters collective cellular ordering remains unclear. Inspired by the analogy between liquid crystals and cells, we investigate how topological defects influence reorganization in dense monolayers of co-cultured fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Owing to steric interactions, these elongated cells exhibit local order; topological defects, where alignment is disrupted, have been postulated to serve as mechanical centers. In this study, we examine how the incorporation of contractile myofibroblasts impacts defect relaxation. The behavior is reminiscent of active nematics with quenched disorder: myofibroblast concentration modulates the disorder strength; increasing their fraction slows defect recombination. Higher myofibroblast concentrations similarly reduce the overall cell alignment on microgrooved surfaces, as myofibroblasts interfere with monolayer reorganization. This observation highlights the potential of a simple, quantitative assay for diagnosing disease progression. Furthermore, we found that myofibroblasts preferentially localize at negatively charged -1/2 defects, compared to fibroblasts, which tend to be localized in +1/2 defects. Consequently, the slowdown of recombination dynamics can be partially attributed to the reduced velocity of the more mobile +1/2 defects. Our study suggests that myofibroblasts can exploit negatively charged defects by avoiding regions of compressive stress and evading apoptosis. Combining live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies, this work provides insights into the role of topological defects in fibrotic disease progression.</description>

      <title>Treatment of sunflower seeds by cold atmospheric plasma enhances their tolerance to water stress during germination and early seedling development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ambient air plasma treatment on both sunflower seed germination and early steps of seedling development under water stress. Dry seeds were exposed to a cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) generated in a dielectric barrier device where excited molecular nitrogen and ozone were detected by optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry respectively. Interestingly, we explain the crucial role of gap's accuracy when treating seeds with CAP, especially to improve interaction between seeds and plasma and therefore ensure an efficient treatment. CAP significantly improved the germination rates of seeds of dormant and non-dormant sunflower genotypes under water stress, demonstrating its efficiency in alleviating seed dormancy and in improving germination under suboptimal conditions. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments demonstrated that plasma treatment also stimulated seedling development under water stress conditions. These findings highlight the potential of CAP treatment as an effective approach to promote the whole process of emergence of crop species.</description>

      <title>Breaking seed dormancy in Mediterranean Brassica rapa wild populations: is cold plasma treatment efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turnip (Brassica rapa) is a native species of the Mediterranean area, spread from northwest France to south Algeria. In this study, dormancy and germination traits were assessed for 61 wild Brassica rapa populations collected across the Mediterranean region. Seed dormancy is a key factor influencing germination and seedling establishment. Three dormancy-breaking methods were compared: gibberellic acid, scarification and cold plasma. The efficiency and selectivity were evaluated through germination ability, time to 10% germination (T10), mean germination time and greenhouse emergence. Five days after imbibition, germination was only 18% for the untreated seeds but 60% for the plasma-treated seeds. Germination also began 24 hours earlier and mean germination time was reduced across most populations. However, there was a limited effect on seedling emergence, which remained around 55% for both untreated and treated samples. Comparative analysis indicates that cold plasma was more effective in alleviating embryo dormancy. In addition, histological and scanning electron microscopy showed that the seed coat differed according to the geographical origin of the populations, with a deeper dormancy in seeds from Sicilian populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>An integrated quantitative single-objective light-sheet microscope for subcellular dynamics in embryos and cultured multicellular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging of subcellular processes in living embryos, stem-cell systems, and organoid models requires microscopy platforms that combine high spatial resolution, fast volumetric acquisition, long-term stability, and minimal phototoxicity. Single-objective light-sheet approaches based on oblique plane microscopy (OPM) are well suited for live imaging in standard sample geometries, but most existing implementations lack the optical calibration, timing precision, and end-to-end integration required for reproducible quantitative measurements. Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts. This work establishes OPM as a robust and quantitatively calibrated single-objective light-sheet platform for transcription imaging in complex living systems.</description>

Abstract: Evolution has shaped animal bodies, yet to what extent biomechanical systems impose constraints and provide opportunities across different behaviors remains unclear. In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory biomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual selection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus canaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that broadens the frequency range of amplified responses. This enhancement encompasses the full range of syllabic rates, with an average magnification of ~94% of the theoretical maximum. Thus, birds sing at a resonance, indicating that rapid song rhythms evolved to operate under shifting natural frequencies of the respiratory biomechanics. Our results illustrate a shared optimization strategy across behavioral states, reveal a deep connection between neural and biomechanical dynamical parameters and show that sexually selected displays may still rely on optimization strategies.</description>

Abstract: Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Field Theory of the Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the statistical inference of a time-dependent rate of events in the framework of Bayesian field theory. This maps the problem to a Langevin equation which, beyond the local linear regime taken as reference, involves nonlinearities and an explicit dependence on the local shape of the maximum likelihood curve. We study the corresponding impacts in a perturbative expansion, formulating a scaling hypothesis for the order of shape corrections. We find that the pure nonlinearities dominate the mean and skewness. Crucially, we uncover that the leading correction to the variance is driven by noise propagation from the signal's effective curvature. We test the derived expansion with numerical simulations and illustrate its applicability on real neural spike data.</description>
