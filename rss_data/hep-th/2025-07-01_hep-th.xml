      <title>Splitting Regions and Shrinking Islands from Higher Point Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constraints from higher-point amplitudes on $2 \to 2$ scattering in the context of effective field theory (EFT) using the perturbative numerical S-matrix bootstrap. Specifically, we investigate the class of weakly coupled EFTs with amplitudes that obey the hidden zero and split conditions that are known to hold both for Tr($\Phi^3$) theory and for certain string tree amplitudes, including at 4-point the beta function. Requiring the splitting condition for the 5-point amplitude not only fixes nearly all its contact terms, but it also imposes non-linear constraints among the 4-point EFT Wilson coefficients. When included in the bootstrap, the resulting allowed region consistent with positivity is no longer convex but is restricted to a smaller non-convex region - which has a sharp corner near the string beta function! Assuming the absence of an infinite spin tower at the mass gap, the allowed region bifurcates into a trivial region (with states only above a chosen cutoff) and an island that continues to shrink around the string as more constraints are included in the bootstrap. The numerics indicate that in the absence of single-mass infinite spin towers the string beta function is the unique 4-point amplitude compatible with hidden zero and the 5-point splitting constraints. The analysis provides a prototype example for how features of higher-point amplitudes constrain the bootstrap of 4-point amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Primal S-matrix bootstrap with dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for constructing the consistent space of scattering amplitudes by parameterizing the imaginary parts of partial waves and utilizing dispersion relations, crossing symmetry, and full unitarity. Using this framework, we explicitly compute bounds on the leading couplings and examine the Regge behaviors of the constructed amplitudes. The method also readily accommodates spinning bound states, which we use to constrain glueball couplings. By incorporating dispersion relations, our approach inherently satisfies the Froissart-Martin/Jin-Martin bounds or softer high-energy behaviors by construction. This, in turn, allows us to formulate a new class of fractionally subtracted dispersion relations, through which we investigate the sensitivity of coupling bounds to the asymptotic growth rate.</description>

      <title>Solving inverse problems of Type IIB flux vacua with conditional generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem in Type IIB flux compactifications of identifying flux vacua with targeted phenomenological properties such as specific superpotential values or tadpole constraints using conditional generative models. These machine learning techniques overcome computational bottlenecks in traditional approaches such as rejection sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which struggle to generate rare, finely-tuned vacua. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that conditional generative models provide a more efficient alternative, specifically using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We introduce a CVAE framework tailored to flux compactifications, incorporating physical constraints directly into the loss function - enabling the generation of physically consistent vacua beyond the training set. Our experiments on conifold and symmetric torus background geometries show that the CVAE achieves a speedup of about $O(10^3)$ compared to Metropolis sampling, particularly in narrow target ranges for superpotential values. Additionally, the CVAE generates novel, distinct flux configurations beyond the training data, highlighting its potential for probing computationally challenging regions of the string landscape. Our results establish conditional generative models as a powerful and scalable tool for targeted flux vacua generation, opening new pathways for model building in regions of the landscape previously inaccessible by traditional model building techniques.</description>

      <title>Assisted Fibre Inflation in Perturbative LVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-field fiber inflation scenario in type IIB perturbative large volume compactifications, showing that the multi-field dynamics suppresses trans-Planckian displacements of the canonical inflaton. Considering a concrete K3-fibred Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold with $h^{1,1}({\rm CY})=3$ and having certain underlying symmetries, we show that the presence of multi-fibre moduli creates an assisted inflation scenario where multiple moduli collectively help in producing the cosmological observables consistent with the experimental observations. We further argue that individual field range excursions $(\Delta\phi_n)$ corresponding to each of the inflaton fields can be estimated as $\Delta\phi_n = \Delta\phi/\sqrt{n}$, where $\Delta\phi$ denotes to the effective single-field inflaton range needed to generate the desired cosmological observables, and $n$ is the number of moduli assisting the multi-fibre inflation. We also present various numerical benchmark models consistently producing cosmological observables in the lights of the recent ACT experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scenarios where Jackiw-Teitelboim black holes are attached to baths whose temperatures can be manipulated externally. We consider the bath to be cooled continuously and numerically investigate the subsequent evolution of the generalized entropies of the black hole. Page curves corresponding to several different cooling profiles of the bath are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we review formulations of wave equations for spin-3/2 fields constructed from different Lorentz group representations. We analyze the Joss-Weinberg single-spin chiral representation and the double-spin chiral representation, focusing on the structure of their covariant operators. We explore the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism and its algebraic properties, originally introduced for spin--0 and spin-1 particles, and here considered as a potential framework for spin 3/2. As a result, we recover the well-known Rarita-Schwinger representation and we find a new possibility in the $(3/2,0) \oplus (0,3/2) \oplus (1,1/2) \oplus (1/2,1)$ representation.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ring homomorphisms between fusion rings appearing in conformal field theories connected under massless renormalization group (RG) flows. By interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection, we propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a massless and massive RG flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring plays a fundamental role as a condensation rule between anyons. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>Relational entanglement entropies and quantum reference frames in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative to quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we demonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice gauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we introduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global boundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming challenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining gauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs naturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable relational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its complement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to the region. The "electric center algebra" of previous approaches is recovered as the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling any extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a generalization of previous proposals for a "magnetic center algebra" is obtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian case, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic corner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and relative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the extrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the non-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic QRFs, we discuss the influence of "asymptotic" symmetries on regional entropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals the interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.</description>

      <title>A basis of the gradient flow exact renormalization group for gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization group (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group (ERG) for gauge theory that is aimed to preserve gauge invariance as manifestly as possible. It achieves this goal by utilizing the Yang--Mills gradient flow or diffusion for the block-spin process. In this paper, we formulate GFERG by the Reuter equation in which the block spinning is done by Gaussian integration. This formulation provides a simple understanding of various points of GFERG, unresolved thus far. First, there exists a unique ordering of functional derivatives in the GFERG equation that remove ambiguity of contact terms. Second, perturbation theory of GFERG suffers from unconventional ultraviolet (UV) divergences if no gauge fixing is introduced. This explains the origin of some UV divergences we have encountered in perturbative solutions to GFERG. Third, the modified correlation functions calculated with the Wilson action in GFERG coincide with the correlation functions of diffused or flowed fields calculated with the bare action. This shows the existence of a Wilson action that reproduces precisely the physical quantities computed by the gradient flow formalism (up to contact terms). We obtain a definite ERG interpretation of the gradient flow. The formulation given in this paper provides a basis for further perturbative/non-perturbative computations in GFERG, preserving gauge invariance maximally.</description>

      <title>Properties of Non-topological Solitons in Two-dimensional Model With Resurrected Conformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the critical bosonic string theory, we explicitly evaluate the three point scattering amplitude at tree level, of a photon with two massive higher spins. The massive excitations belong to states of the form $A_{-r_1}^{s_1} A_{-r_2}^{s_2}$ where $A_{-n}$ is a DDF creation operator. Next, we take the infinite ``spin'' limit to arrive at the classical string dynamics. We find a rotating ``floppy'' string lying mostly on a plane which develops a transverse kink.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the particle spectrum of a second-order (in derivatives) theory based on a rank-2 tensor field with both symmetric and antisymmetric components. By demanding the existence of a propagating massless spin-2 particle and invariance under transverse diffeomorphisms, we derive a new class of stable models with two massless scalars and a single massless spin-2 particle. A natural nonlinear completion is proposed in terms of a dynamical metric field. The identification of the spectrum is carried out using a fully Lagrangian, gauge-invariant approach which makes use of Bardeen variables in a constructive manner. The approach significantly reduces the number of steps in the spectrum determination in some cases.</description>

      <title>Conformal scalar field theory from Ising tricriticality on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement bootstrap program has generated new quantum numbers associated with degrees of freedom living on gapped domain walls between topological phases in two dimensions. Most fundamental among these are the so-called "parton" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite sectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along the way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT.</description>

      <title>Probing the transition from classical to quantum radiation reaction in relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transition from classical radiation reaction, described by the Landau-Lifshitz model, to the quantum mechanical regime. The plasma is subject to a circularly polarized field where the self-consistent plasma current is the source of the electromagnetic field through Ampere's law. The radiation reaction implies wave energy loss, frequency up-conversion, and a modified distribution function. Increasing the value of the quantum $\chi$-parameter, the quantum results gradually differ from the classical ones. Moreover, the deviation between models also depends on the plasma parameters, including density and temperature. We discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Measurements in stochastic gravity and thermal variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a free, conformally invariant, Maxwell quantum field (photon) interacting with a cosmological background spacetime, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and semiclassical and stochastic gravity. The thermal fluctuations give rise to backreaction effects upon the spacetime geometry, which are incorporated in the semiclassical Einstein-Langevin equation, evaluated in the cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We first evaluate the semiclassical Einstein equation for the background geometry sourced by the thermal quantum stress-energy tensor. For large enough temperature, the solution is approximated by a radiation-dominated expanding universe driven by the thermal bath of photons. We then evaluate the thermal noise kernel associated to the quantum fluctuations of the photon field using point-splitting regularization methods, and give its explicit analytic form in the limits of large and small temperature, as well as a local approximation. Finally, we prove that this thermal noise kernel corresponds exactly to the thermal variance of the induced fluctuations of the linearized metric perturbation in the local and covariant measurement scheme defined by Fewster and Verch. Our analysis allows to quantify the extent to which quantum fluctuations may give rise to non-classical effects, and thus become relevant in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Large condensation in enriched $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the language of enriched $\infty$-categories, we formalize and generalize the definition of fusion n-category, and an analogue of iterative condensation of $E_i$-algebras. The former was introduced by Johnson-Freyd, and the latter by Kong, Zhang, Zhao, and Zheng. This extends categorical condensation beyond fusion n-categories to all enriched monoidal $\infty$-categories with certain colimits. The resulting theory is capable of treating symmetries of arbitrary dimension and codimension that are enriched, continuous, derived, non-semisimple and non-separable. Additionally, we consider a truncated variant of the notion of condensation introduced by Gaiotto and Johnson-Freyd, and show that iterative condensation of monoidal monads and $E_i$-algebras provide examples. In doing so, we prove results on functoriality of Day convolution for enriched $\infty$-categories, and monoidality of two versions of the Eilenberg-Moore functor, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Radiative Mass Generation in Gauged Theories of Flavour: A Path to Fermion Mass Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of models based on extended gauged flavour symmetries that address the hierarchical structure of fermion masses in the Standard Model (SM) through the radiative mass generation mechanism. In these frameworks, only third-generation fermions acquire tree-level masses, while the first and second generations gain their masses via quantum corrections induced by new gauge bosons, naturally explaining the observed mass hierarchy. Since the technically natural structure of fermion masses in the SM prevents such a mechanism from being implemented directly, we propose extensions involving both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge symmetries. Abelian extensions, which must be flavour non-universal, typically generate masses for only second-generation fermions at the 1-loop level, requiring higher order corrections or extension of gauge structure to account for first-generation masses. We show that either a $U(1)_1 \times U(1)_2$ extension or a single $U(1)_F$ with up to 2-loop mass generation can successfully realize the mechanism, with the latter predicting a viable new physics scale around $10^3$ TeV when flavour-violating charges are optimized. Non-Abelian extensions, such as those based on $SU(3)_F$, provide a more constrained and predictive setup due to a comparatively fewer number of free parameters. We also explore a radiative mechanism in Abelian extensions within left-right symmetric theories, which simultaneously addresses the strong CP problem. All these models collectively offer a compelling and testable framework for generating a realistic SM fermion mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Curvature and Topological Insights of Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the influence of string fluids on the extended thermodynamic structure and microscopic interactions of Hayward black holes by employing thermodynamic geometry as an empirical tool. Using the novel equation of state obtained for regular black holes surrounded by string fluids, we analyze the extended phase space with enthalpy as the central thermodynamic potential. By examining the behavior of the normalized Ruppeiner curvature scalar $R_N$ in the temperature-volume $(T,V)$ plane, we analyzed the influence of the string fluid parameters on the microstructure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the presence of string fluids significantly modifies the dominant microscopic interactions, transitioning from attractive to repulsive regimes depending on the charge and volume of the black hole. We see that the thermodynamic curvature effectively detects critical points and phase transitions, reflecting the nature of repulsive or attractive interactions among black hole microstructures. We further investigate thermodynamic topology to provide a novel classification scheme for stability and phase behavior, delineating local stable and unstable regions in parameter space. We investigate the thermodynamic topology of Hayward-AdS black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing that the number and type of topological charges depend on the parameters $\epsilon$ and $b$, revealing phase transitions and stability characteristics encoded in the global topological charge $W$. This integrated study of the thermodynamic geometry and topology structure enhances the understanding of Hayward black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing overall thermodynamic stability and configuration with significant implications for holographic duality and potential astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Configurable photonic simulator for quantum field dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field simulators provide unique opportunities for investigating the dynamics of quantum fields through tabletop experiments. A primary drawback of standard encoding schemes is their rigidity: altering the theory, its coupling geometry, metric structure, or simulation time typically requires redesigning the experimental setup, which imposes strong constraints on the types of dynamics and theories that can be simulated. Here, we introduce the Optical Time Algorithm (OTA) as a unifying framework, enabling the efficient simulation of large classes of free quantum field dynamics using a single optical circuit design that separates the time from the Hamiltonian's structure. By modifying the parameters of the optical elements, our method allows us to engineer timescales, coupling graphs, spacetime metrics, and boundary conditions, thereby facilitating the implementation of relativistic and non-relativistic, real- and complex-valued, short- and long-range quantum field theories on both flat and curved spacetimes. We exploit the OTA's configurability to investigate the spreading of quantum correlations in space and time for theories with continuously varying coupling ranges. Relevant features predicted by quantum field theory can be observed on systems of $10-20$ modes, which paves the ground for experimental implementations.</description>

Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for rewriting dimensionally regulated Feynman parameter integrals in the Minkowski regime as a sum of real, positive integrands multiplied by complex prefactors. This representation eliminates the need for contour deformation, allowing for direct numerical or analytic evaluation of the integrals. We develop an algorithm to construct such representations for a broad class of integrals and demonstrate its generalisation through selected examples. Our approach is applied to integrals up to three loops, including cases with internal masses and off-shell external legs. The resulting expressions are suitable for evaluation using existing techniques, such as sector decomposition, where we observe performance gains of up to four orders of magnitude in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Soft and virtual corrections to semi-inclusive DIS up to four loops in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the threshold resummation formalism for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) to derive the soft and virtual corrections for the SIDIS cross section up to four loops in QCD. Using the recently computed next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the SIDIS cross section together with known results for the form factor and splitting functions in QCD up to four loops, we derive the complete soft and collinear contributions to the SIDIS coefficient functions at four-loop order. We also include systematically the next-to-leading power corrections, which are suppressed near threshold. The numerical analysis of the new four-loop corrections shows a small effect on the cross section underpinning the very good perturbative stability of the SIDIS process at that order in perturbation theory, including the reduced dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$.</description>

Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under energy constraints in the observable universe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present significant evidence that the powerful property of Yangian invariance extends to a new large class of conformally invariant Feynman integrals. Our results apply to planar Feynman diagrams in any spacetime dimension dual to an arbitrary network of intersecting straight lines on a plane (Baxter lattice), with propagator powers determined by the geometry. We formulate Yangian symmetry in terms of a chain of Lax operators acting on the fixed coordinates around the graph, and we also extend this construction to the case of infinite-dimensional auxiliary space. Yangian invariance leads to new differential and integral equations for individual, highly nontrivial, Feynman graphs, and we present them explicitly for several examples. The graphs we consider determine correlators in the recently proposed loom fishnet CFTs. We also describe a generalization to the case with interaction vertices inside open faces of the diagram. Our construction unifies and greatly extends the known special cases of Yangian invariance to likely the most general family of integrable scalar planar graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we set up the theoretical framework and indicate future applications of symmetric Yang--Mills fields to cosmology. We analyze the coset space dimensional reduction scheme to construct pure Yang--Mills fields on spacetimes given as cylinders over cosets. Particular cases of foliations using $H^n$, dS$_n$ and AdS$_n$ slices as non-compact symmetric spaces are solved, compared to previous results in the literature, and generalized in a structured fashion. Coupling to general relativity in FLRW-type universes is introduced via the cosmological scale factor. For the hyperbolic slicing in 4D, the dynamics of the Einstein--Yang--Mills system is analytically solved and discussed. Finally, we generalize the analysis to warped foliations of the cylinders, which enlarge the range of possible spacetimes while also introducing a Hubble friction-like term in the equation of motion for the Yang--Mills field.</description>

The results are compared with generalized Holomorphic anomaly approach, which provides order by order expansion in $\Omega$-background parameters $\epsilon_{1,2}$. Another crucial test of our results provides comparison with respect to Painlev\'{e} 1 $\tau$-function, which was expected to be hold in self-dual case $\epsilon_1=-\epsilon_2$. We also discuss Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit $\epsilon_1=0$, accessible either by means of deformed Seiberg-Witten curve, or WKB methods.</description>

      <title>Effect of backreaction on Island, Page curve and Mutual Information</title>

Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation in a bath attached to a deformed eternal AdS black hole. This black hole is dual to the two identical strongly coupled large-$N_c$ thermal field theories, where each theory is backreacted (deformed) by the presence of a uniform static distribution of heavy fundamental quarks. In our observation we find that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases in a quadratic manner for an early time and linearly for the late time. The large time expression for the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is used to find the Page curve and Page time. After the Page time, the entanglement entropy saturates to a constant value due to the appearance of an island. We observe that introducing deformation (backreaction) delays the appearance of island and shifts the Page curve to a later time. Subsequently, the computation of the scrambling time reveals an increase with the backreaction parameter, suggesting a longer duration for information retrieval in the presence of deformation. Moreover, our analysis of the mutual information between the radiation subsystems shows that it vanishes at a critical time which increases with the deformation before the Page time. After the Page time, the appearance of island leads to the vanishing of mutual information between black hole subsystems and gives the time difference of the order of scrambling time.</description>

      <title>An On-Shell Derivation of the Soft Effective Action in Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the soft effective action in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories from the on-shell action obeying Neumann boundary conditions at timelike and null infinity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity. This allows us to identify the on-shell degrees of freedom on the boundary with the soft modes living on the celestial sphere. Following the work of Donnelly and Wall, this suggests that we can interpret soft modes as entanglement edge modes on the celestial sphere and study entanglement properties of soft modes in abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Novel Insights in Quantum Dynamics through Extended Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in the study of the model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK), as elucidated in a recent paper, we embark on a re-evaluation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Our motivation stems from the insights gained from the DSSYK model, particularly its ability to capture essential features of quantum dynamics and gravitational effects. In this work, we delve into the SYK model, uncovering precise solutions for the two-point function and self-energy that have not been previously reported. Building upon the advancements made in particle physics phenomenology, we extend the SYK model to encompass tensor field theory. Through the incorporation of a cutoff term to ensure convergence, we substantially advance our understanding of quantum many-body physics. Our investigation extends to experimental parameter estimation and the exploration of cutoff dependency in random couplings, providing invaluable insights into system dynamics. The introduction of a novel tensor field theory replaces conventional fermionic degrees of freedom with tensorial counterparts, leading to the discovery of intriguing phase transition phenomena characterized by a first-order transition. Furthermore, we elucidate a direct linear relationship between the coupling parameter and the cutoff scale. These findings not only shed light on emergent behavior across both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems but also pave the way for further theoretical and experimental exploration, inspired by the recent advancements in the SYK model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that both the running coupling and the gluon propagator remain finite at infrared scales and that the latter shows positivity violations which reflects the presence of massless modes. We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, its residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss and derive the off-shell nilpotent of order two and absolutely anti-commuting Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST), anti-BRST, co-BRST and anti-co-BRST symmetry transformations for the non-interacting Friedberg-Lee-Pang-Ren (FLPR) model in one (0 + 1)-dimension (1D) of spacetime by exploiting the standard techniques of the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) onto (1, 1)-dimensional super sub-manifold of the general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold, where the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions play a crucial role. We provide clear proof of nilpotency and absolute anti-commutativity properties of the (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-)co-BRST Noether's conserved charges within the framework of ACSA to BRST formalism, where we take only one Grassmannian variable in place of two usual Grassmannian variables (i.e., fermionic variables). Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the Lagrangian of this non-interacting FLPR model is (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-)co-BRST symmetries invariance within the ambit of the ACSA to BRST approach in (1, 1)-dimensional super sub-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the reflected entropy for bipartite mixed state configurations in a $T\bar{T}$ deformed boundary conformal field theory in $2$ dimensions (BCFT$_2$). The bulk dual is described by asymptotically AdS$_3$ geometries with the cut off surface pushed deeper into the bulk and truncated by an end of the world brane. We obtain the reflected entropy up to a linear order in the radial cut-off for static and time dependent configurations involving an eternal black hole, from the island and defect extremal surface (DES) prescriptions in the context of the deformed AdS/BCFT. We observe agreement of the leading order correction for all cases between the two prescriptions. We also obtain the analogous of the Page curves for the reflected entropy and investigate the modification due to the $T\bar{T}$ deformation.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Classical worldlines from scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic diagrammatic investigation of the classical limit of observables computed from scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory through the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, motivated by the study of gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We achieve the manifest cancellation of divergences in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit at the integrand level beyond one loop by employing the Schwinger parametrisation to rewrite both cut and uncut propagators in a worldline-like representation before they are combined. The resulting finite classical integrand takes the same form as the counterpart in the worldline formalisms such as post-Minkowskian effective field theory (PMEFT) and worldline quantum field theory (WQFT), and in fact exactly coincides with the latter in various examples, showing explicitly the equivalence between scattering amplitude and worldline formalisms. The classical causality flow, as expressed by the retarded propagator prescription, appears as an emergent feature. Examples are presented for impulse observables in electrodynamics and a scalar model at two loops, as well as certain subclasses of diagrams to higher orders and all orders.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum for two-body scattering is determined by the radiation-reaction (RR) term in the one-loop waveform. This RR term is actually proportional to the tree-level waveform, and this reduces the calculation of the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss, $J_\text{2rad}$, to two loops, instead of three loops as one would expect by power counting. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a three-family $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. The factorizable geometry allows for explicit control over rigid cycles and moduli stabilization. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the holographic optical appearance of an AdS black hole with higher derivative corrections in the presence of a string cloud, drawing on the AdS/CFT correspondence and wave optics. We introduce a Gaussian wave source that oscillates at the AdS boundary and propagates through the bulk. The resulting response function is then analyzed using an imaging system to study the optical properties of the black hole. Depending on the observer's position and variations in system parameters, the resulting holographic image takes on different forms, including a well defined Einstein ring, deformed luminous patterns, or isolated bright spots. Notably, when the observer is positioned at the north pole, the image consistently features a bright ring at the photon sphere, encircled by concentric stripes. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between the Einstein ring's location and the photon sphere radius predicted by geometric optics, reinforcing the connection between wave optics and gravitational lensing. Additionally, we examine the influence of higher-derivative corrections and string cloud parameters on the observed optical features.</description>

Abstract: Carrollian conformal field theory offers an alternative description of massless scattering amplitudes, that is holographic in nature. In an effort to build a framework that is both predictive and constraining, we construct operator product expansions (OPE) that are compatible with carrollian symmetries. In this way, we unify and extend preliminary works on the subject, and demonstrate that the carrollian OPEs indeed control the short-distance expansion of carrollian correlators and amplitudes. In the process, we extend the representation theory of carrollian conformal fields such as to account for composite operators like the carrollian stress tensor or those creating multiparticle states. In addition we classify 2- and 3-point carrollian correlators and amplitudes with complex kinematics, and give the general form of the 4-point function allowed by symmetry.</description>

Using the functional approach and local momentum representation, the coefficient of the derivative term is calculated up to the first order in curvature in the one-scalar theory. The two-scalar problem is solved by extracting normal modes and consequent reduction to the single-scalar case. The method can be applied to a larger number of scalars. In the theory with strong hierarchy of masses, the renormalized effective potential and the coefficients of the second-order derivative terms demonstrate the quantum decoupling in the low-energy limit.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mirror Axion Solitons</title>

Abstract: We study an axion soliton, which weakly interacts with background matter and magnetic fields. A mirror-symmetric soliton, for which the magnetic flow is due to secondary magnetic helicity invariant, is described by the Iroshnikov-Kreichnan spectrum. For a large scale magnetic field dynamo is not observed. In a mirror axionic soliton, a phase transition, which produces a magnetic helical flow, is possible. Using this transition, the soliton becomes mirror-asymmetric. When the mirror symmetry is broken, the axion soliton allows the magnetic energy, which is the result of the transformation of the axionic energy. In the main result, for an initial stage of the process, we calculate a scale for which the generation of large scale magnetic fields is the most intense. By making numerical simulations, we received that lower lateral harmonics of the magnetic field have greater amplitudes compared to higher ones. A simplest statistical ensemble, which is defined by the projection of all harmonics onto principal harmonics is constructed. We put forward an assumption that it was the indication to some instability in axionic MHD. Now, we can provide a possible explanation of this feature. When the mirror symmetry of the axion soliton is broken, the $\gamma$-term in the axionic mean field equation, which is related to the axion spatial inhomogeneity, interacts with principal harmonics. As the result, the axion soliton acquires the magnetic energy and becomes helical.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy of single-mode squeezed states in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a single-mode squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory within wedge regions of Minkowski spacetime. Similarly to the case of coherent states, this relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. Consequently, the Araki-Uhlmann entropy between a single-mode squeezed state and the vacuum satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows.</description>

Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit. This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications, including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyse infinite classes of regular supergravity backgrounds dual to four-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) compactified on a circle with a supersymmetry-preserving twist. These flows lead to three-dimensional gapped QFTs preserving four supercharges. The solutions arise in Type IIB, Type IIA, and eleven-dimensional supergravity, and generalise known constructions by incorporating deformations that avoid typical singularities associated with the holographic description of the Coulomb branch of the CFT. We examine several observables: Wilson loops, holographic central charges, and complexity. We show they exhibit a universal factorisation, with each observable decomposing into a UV-CFT contribution times a flow-dependent factor. We also explore the parameter regimes where higher-curvature corrections become relevant, affecting the physical interpretation of certain observables. Our findings provide new insights into universal features of holographic RG flows and resolve a puzzle related to complexity in these systems.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangians which transform homogeneously under a global transformation of the fields (a global rescaling, for instance) can be written on-shell as a total derivative which has a universal, solution-independent expression, using a functional version of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. We study the uniqueness of this expression and how this result can be used in the construction of generalized Komar charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first-order formalism, the Einstein--Hilbert action can be modified by the addition of a Holst term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. This modification breaks parity although it does not affect the equations of motion. We show that the standard Komar charge is also modified by the addition of a topological term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. For the Killing vector that generates time translations, the value of the Komar integral at infinity is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the NUT charge $N$ and the parity-breaking Barbero parameter. Thus, as in the standard Witten effect, a non-vanishing NUT charge $N$ induces a non-vanishing mass $\alpha N$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the monodromy group of the differential systems for multiloop integrals. We describe a simple heuristic method to obtain the monodromy matrices as functions of space-time dimension $d$. We observe that in a special basis the elements of these matrices are Laurent polynomials in $z=\exp(i\pi d)$ with integer coefficients, i.e., the monodromy group is a subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z}[z,1/z])$. We derive bilinear relations for monodromies in $d$ and $-d$ dimensions which follow from the twisted Riemann bilinear relations and check that the found monodromy matrices satisfy them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new model of a particle propagating in $4D$, ${\cal N}=1$ superspace that describes the dynamics of a continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup. The model is characterized by two-component Weyl spinor additional even variables playing the role of extra coordinates. A canonical formulation, specific local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry, and a compete system of bosonic and fermionic constraints are derived. All bosonic constrains are first-class, while fermionic constraints are a mixture of first and second classes. Using additional variables inherent in to the model, we split the fermionic constraints into first and second classes in a covariant way. Quantization of the model is carried out according to Dirac prescription imposing all the first-class constraints and half of the second-class constraints (Gupta-Bleuler procedure) on the wave function. At quantization, the fermionic constraints are written in terms of spinor supercovariant derivatives acting on superfields. The corresponding wave function, which is either a chiral or antichiral superfield, depends on additional variables and obeys the superfield constraints that define the continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup in the superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis investigates effective field and string theories in which supersymmetry is realized and broken in various ways. Chapter 1 addresses effective theories with nonlinearly realized supersymmetry, constructed using the formalism of constrained superfields. We establish a criterion for identifying inconsistent constraints, formulate their improved versions, and propose, along these lines, improved supergravity models of inflation. In Chapter 2, we discuss a peculiar application of this framework: the gravitational production of massive gravitinos in time-dependent backgrounds. We emphasize some physical subtleties in the standard description of this mechanism, which become particularly severe in the case of the gravitino. Next, the focus shifts to linear supersymmetry, and we investigate the leading-order coupling of the massive spin-2 field supermultiplet to pure supergravity in four dimensions. This analysis is carried out using the supercurrent superfield formalism, and it shows that only a single class of such couplings can be consistently defined. This is fundamentally distinct from the coupling obtained by compactifying higher-dimensional supergravities, and it has interesting connections to string theory and the string lamppost principle. Finally, in Chapter 3, we present a novel orientifold projection of type IIB string theory. This is a Scherk--Schwarz orientifold in which supersymmetry is entirely broken, and the O-planes couple only to the twisted sector of the theory. We argue that this model is invariant under S-duality and can be formulated as an F-theory compactification. We also analyze the D-brane spectrum of the theory and compare the results with earlier similar constructions. All original findings presented in this thesis are preceded by a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the general frameworks to which they belong.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key issues in holography is going beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the $T \overline{T}$ deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents associated with chaotic motions of both massless and massive particles in the vicinity of a Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. Our exploration focuses on their correlations with the black hole phase transition and the chaos bound. The results demonstrate that these exponents serve as effective probes of the phase transition, with the chaotic Lyapunov exponent of the massless particle offering a more precise characterization. Further calculations indicate that critical exponents linked to these Lyapunov exponents are uniformly 1/2. Notably, the violation of the chaos bound occurs irrespective of whether a phase transition is taking place. Through comparative analysis, we identify a critical radius, and the violation consistently arises when the black hole's radius is less than this critical radius. Moreover, this violation is observed in the spacetime of the stable small black hole during the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Topological Holography: Towards a Unification of Landau and Beyond-Landau Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.</description>

      <title>Anderson duality of topological modular forms and its differential-geometric manifestations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study a morphism of spectra implementing the Anderson duality of topological modular forms ($\mathrm{TMF}$). Its differential version will then be introduced, allowing us to pair elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ with spin manifolds whose boundaries are equipped with string structure. A few negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ will then be constructed using the theory of $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded $\mathrm{TMF}$, and will be identified using the differential pairing. We also discuss a conjecture relating vertex operator algebras and negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$, underlying much of the discussions of this paper. The paper ends with a separate appendix for physicists, in which the contents of the paper are summarized and translated into their language.</description>

      <title>Constructions and deformations of Calabi--Yau 3-folds in codimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct polarized Calabi--Yau 3-folds with at worst isolated canonical orbifold points in codimension 4 that can be described in terms of the equations of the Segre embedding of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2$ in $\mathbb P^8$. We investigate the existence of other deformation families in their Hilbert scheme by either studying Tom and Jerry degenerations or by comparing their Hilbert series with those of existing low codimension Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Among other interesting results, we find a family of Calabi--Yau 3-fold with five distinct Tom and Jerry deformation families, a phenomenon not seen for $\mathbb Q$-Fano 3-folds. We compute the Hodge numbers of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2 $ Calabi--Yau 3-folds and corresponding manifolds obtained by performing crepant resolutions. We obtain a manifold with a pair of Hodge numbers that does not appear in the famously known list of 30108 distinct Hodge pairs of Kruzer--Skarke, in the list of 7890 distinct Hodge pairs corresponding to complete intersections in the product of projective spaces and in Hodge paris obtained from Calabi--Yau 3-folds having low codimension embeddings in weighted projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at higher temperatures in the quantum critical regime.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical studies as the conservation laws and the radiation fields are investigated in the pseudo-electrodynamics. We explore the action symmetry under infinitesimal transformations to obtain the energy-momentum, the Belinfante-Rosenfeld, and the general angular momentum tensors for this nonlocal planar electrodynamics. Through the results such as the retarded potentials and fields generated by a point particle in an arbitrary motion, we study the radiation of an electric dipole and it radiated power in 1+2 dimensions. In addition, we propose a way to introduce magnetic monopoles in pseudo-electrodynamics, in which the solutions and conservation laws are also presented.</description>

Abstract: The motion of particles hit by a burst of gravitational waves generated by flyby admits, for the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile, only a numerical description. The profile can however be approximated by the hyperbolic Scarf potential which admits an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our toy model is consistent with the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev provided the wave amplitude takes certain ``magical'' values.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>Exact results for spin glass criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically Charged Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and quench dynamics in the thermally perturbed tricritical fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <title>On the Dark-Energy Enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>
