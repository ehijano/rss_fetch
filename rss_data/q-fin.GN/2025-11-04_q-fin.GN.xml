      <title>A parallel monetary system based on the redeemable self-decaying money -- The ultimate hedge and safe haven of private wealth in the rising wave of over issuance of fiat and token money/stablecoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A currency with stable purchasing power can always provide a psychological haven for people around the world. However, since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, issuing more cheap currencies has become a common trend in the international community, and the legalization and over issuance of stablecoins will strengthen this trend. In this context, our study focused on a parallel monetary system based on a redeemable self-decay/devalued money(RSDM). Firstly, we point out the idea of redeeming gold at a fixed denomination with gold certificates is similar to an impossible perpetual motion machine. Only when the face value of a gold token self-decays or self-depreciates and the weight of the reduced value can compensate for the storage cost of physical gold, can it be convertible or redeemable. Secondly, we pointed out that as a modern "good money" under the Internet environment, it must have two basic functions: long-term value storage and zero logistics cost of money circulation. Thirdly, we found that a single type of money is difficult to shoulder the responsibility of modern "good money". Only a parallel monetary system, including RSDM, such as a triple-monetary system consisting of RSDM, domestic fiat and major international reserve currencies, can form the ultimate safe haven of wealth and safeguard the reverse Gresham law. Based on this analysis, we build an integer programming model for currency optimization selection in a multi-monetary pool. Fourthly, several potential application scenarios of RSDM in the real world were discussed, including a new approach to activate dormant gold assets in India based on RSDM, and the gold monetization scheme in the United States. Finally, the demand for RSDM with precious metals as collateral was analyzed, providing theoretical support for establishing a sound parallel monetary system based on RSDM.</description>

      <title>How Digital Asset Treasury Companies Can Survive Bear Markets: The Case of the Strategy and Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, public firms that hold large crypto reserves as a core strategy, deliver levered exposure to digital assets but face acute downside risk when equity premia over net asset value multiples (mNAV) compress in bear markets. This paper develops a survival framework that couples conservative treasury policy with an operating line that monetizes holdings independent of mark-to-market gains. Using Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as a case, we propose a "BTC-to-sats" payments rail that allocates a small, risk-capped liquidity sleeve of the treasury to Lightning Network channels, generating price-agnostic fee revenue (acquiring bps, routing, hedge/FX spread) while keeping settlement exposure near zero beta to BTC. We formalize a no-forced-sale condition and show how disclosed KPIs allow investors to test whether operating cash flows can bridge an 18 to 24-month bear without liquidations. The feasibility of the rail is supported by Strategy's Lightning initiative and empirical Lightning performance. Our model generalizes across DAT types and provides implementable disclosures that can sustain an mNAV premium through cycles.</description>

      <title>Words That Unite The World: A Unified Framework for Deciphering Central Bank Communications Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks (WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date, comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility.
