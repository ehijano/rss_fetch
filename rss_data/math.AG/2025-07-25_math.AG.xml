      <title>On the construction of a counterexample to Strassen's rank additivity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rank additivity conjecture, first formulated by Volker Strassen in 1973, states that the rank of the direct sum of two independent tensors is equal to the sum of their individual ranks. In the last decades, this conjecture has been a central topic in tensor rank theory and its implications for computational complexity. In 2019, Yaroslav Shitov disproved this conjecture in its general form by showing the existence of a counter-example using a dimension counting argument. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Strassen problem and Shitov's work and revisit his counterexample with a detailed explanation, offering an alternative proof.</description>

      <title>Lifting Deligne-Lusztig Reduction and Geometric Coxeter Type Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur.
  In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces.
  We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphism group and real forms of complexity-one varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over a perfect field. We study the representability of the equivariant automorphism group of G-varieties. For a broad class of complexity-one G-varieties, we show that this group is representable by a group scheme locally of finite type when the base field has characteristic zero. We also establish representability, by a linear group, in the case of almost homogeneous G-varieties of arbitrary complexity. Using an exact sequence description of the equivariant automorphism group, we derive a criterion to determine whether a complexity-one variety admits only finitely many real forms. In contrast, we present a very simple example of a complexity one surface having infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic real forms.</description>

      <title>A Microlocal Theory for Zariski-Constructible Sheaves on Rigid Analytic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microlocal theory, in the sense of Kashiwara-Schapira, for Zariski-constructible sheaves on rigid analytic varieties. We define and study monodromic sheaves, the monodromic Fourier transform, specialisation, microlocalisation, micro-hom, and singular support in this context. Some questions and conjectures are formulated in the end. The appendix contains infinity-categorical characterisations of monodromic sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the codimension 1 PGL(3) orbit closures in $\text{Gr}(3,6)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projective linear group $\text{PGL}(3)$ naturally acts on the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(3, V_2)$ of $3$-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V_2$ of homogeneous conics in 3 variables. It was proved by Abdallah, Emsalem and Iarrobino in 2021 that this action has a one-parameter family of orbits along with 14 special orbits. The codimension 1 orbits of this action consist of the entire one-parameter family of orbits, along with 2 of the 14 special orbits. In this paper, we calculate the classes of the codimension 1 orbit closures in the Chow ring of $\text{Gr}(3, V_2)$.</description>

      <title>Real Bialynicki-Birula flows in moduli spaces of Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $\geqslant 2$ and let $\sigma:X \to X$ be an anti-holomorphic involution. Using real and quaternionic systems of Hodge bundles, we study the topology of the real locus $\mathbb{R} \mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(r,d)$ of the moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles of rank $r$ and degree $d$ on $X$, for the induced real structure $(E,\phi) \to (\sigma^*(\overline{E}),\sigma^*(\overline{\phi}))$. We show in particular that, when $\mathrm{gcd}(r,d)=1$, the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R} \mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{Dol}}(r,d)$ coincides with that of $\mathbb{R} \mathrm{Pic}_d(X)$, which is well-known.</description>

      <title>On 7-adic Galois representations for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</description>

      <title>A note on D-modules on the projective spaces of a class of G-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation $(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential $\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of skew-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>The Alpha Group Dynamic Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behavior of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governed by a matrix that represents the division in the algebra of the Alpha group. As the system evolves, the matrix induces topological transitions in geometric spaces, controlled by a rotational parameter. Numerical simulations are performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method implemented in Python. The results reveal the emergence of topological nodes, the existence of critical points at which the rotation between dividing planes transitions from 0 to $\pi/2$ radians. Near zero radians, the system exhibits a Euclidean geometric structure, while rotations close to $\pi/2$ define an Alpha Group space. At these nodes, the matrix-driven ODE system undergoes qualitative dynamic changes, reflecting distinct topological behaviors. The Alpha Group matrix is interpreted as a generator of symmetry transformations, potentially analogous to gauge fields under local or global symmetries. This work provides a computational framework for exploring dynamic topologies, attractors at infinity, and internal coherence in hyper-complex vector spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Iitaka conjecture for anticanonical divisors in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a fibration over a perfect field of positive characteristic, we study an Iitaka-type inequality for the anticanonical divisors. We conclude that it holds when the source of the fibration is a threefold or when the target is a curve, the general fibre is regular and the pair induced on it from the ambient space is strongly F-regular. We then give counterexamples in characteristics 2 and 3 for fibrations with non-normal fibres, constructed from Tango--Raynaud surfaces.</description>

      <title>Motivic Steenrod problem away from the characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topology, the Steenrod problem asks whether every singular homology class is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold. Here, we introduce an analogous question in algebraic geometry: is every element on the Chow line of the motivic cohomology of $X$ the pushforward of a fundamental class along a projective derived-lci morphism? If $X$ is a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p \geq 0$, then a positive answer to this question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by alterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily so: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$ that are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A consequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be expressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the first-named-author in his thesis.</description>

Abstract: For any $n \ge 3$, we consider the moduli space $M_n$ of semistable sheaves with Mukai vector $2(1,0,1-n)$ on a K3 surface. The moduli space $M_n$ is singular and lacks a crepant resolution, but might still admit a categorical crepant one. As a preliminary to exploring this possibility, we study the explicit resolution of singularities of $M_n$ constructed by O'Grady, and provide a global description of its exceptional locus.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the generic invariance of the Fano type property in cases where the volumes of anti-canonical divisors of Fano type fibers are a constant over a Zariski-dense subset, or the Fano type fibers are dimension $2$. Additionally, paralleling this theorem, we establish a conjecture by Schwede and Smith under the condition that the volumes of anti-canonical divisors remain constant in the reduction mod $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fit the Brauer group of a $\mu_r$-gerbe over a (possibly arbitrarily singular) stacky curve into an exact sequence and give characterizations for when it is short exact and conditions for when it splits. We also give a precise formula for the Brauer group of a $\mu_r$-gerbe in the case that the base curve is smooth.</description>

      <title>Motivic classes of fixed-generators Hilbert schemes of unibranch curve singularities and Igusa zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the study of Hilbert schemes of unibranch plane curves whose points have a fixed number of minimal generators. Building on the work of Oblomkov, Rasmussen and Shende we provide a formula for their motivic classes and investigate the relationship with principal Hilbert schemes of the same given unibranch curve. In addition, the paper specializes this study to the case of $(p,q)$-curves, where we obtain more structured results for the motivic classes of fixed-generators Hilbert schemes: their positivity and topological invariance, and an explicit relationship to one-generator schemes i.e. principal ideals in $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{C,0}$. Finally, we focus on a special open component in the one-generator locus, whose motivic class is naturally related to the motivic measure on the arc scheme $\mathbb A^2_\infty$ of the plane introduced by Denef and Loeser as well as to the Igusa zeta function. We also provide an explicit formulation of these motivic classes in terms of an embedded resolution of the singularity, proving their polynomiality as well as making them an interesting topological invariant of the given curve.</description>

      <title>Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Schubert varieties arising from cluster structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.09912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies is a generalization of that of Newton polytopes for toric varieties, and it gives a systematic method of constructing toric degenerations of projective varieties. In this paper, we study Newton-Okounkov bodies of Schubert varieties from the theory of cluster algebras. We construct Newton-Okounkov bodies using specific valuations which generalize extended g-vectors in cluster theory, and discuss how these bodies are related to string polytopes and Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes.</description>

      <title>Hodge Laplacian and geometry of Kuranishi family of Fano manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first obtain eigenvalue estimates for the Hodge Laplacian on Fano manifolds, which follow from the Bochner-Kodaira formula. Then we apply it to study the geometry of the Kuranishi family of deformations of Fano manifolds. We show that the original K\"ahler form remains to be a K\"ahler form for other members of the Kuranishi family, and give an explicit formula of the Ricci potential. We also show that our set-up gives another account for the Donaldson-Fujiki picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03840v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a general Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem by using the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence picture and Berndtsson's theorem in \cite{Bern20}. In the test configuration ($\mathbb C^*$-degeneration) case, our approach gives a quick proof of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem without taking limit or using singular weight, which is very different from the Ohsawa-Chen-Blocki-Guan-Zhou approach and the Berndtsson-Lempert approach. Another advantage of our approach is that it fits better to the sharp estimate for the weighted Bergman kernel on compact manifold. Applications include a sharp lower bound of the Bergman kernel for compact Riemann surfaces and a non-vanishing theorem in terms of (weighted) Okounkov bodies.</description>

      <title>Bihamiltonian structure of the DR hierarchy in the semisimple case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Of the two approaches to integrable systems associated to semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs), the one suggested by Dubrovin and Zhang and the more recent one using the geometry of the double ramification (DR) cycle, the second has the advantage of being very explicit. The Poisson operator of the DR hierarchy is $\eta^{-1} \partial_x$, where $\eta$ is the metric of the CohFT, and the Hamiltonians are explicitly defined as generating functions of intersection numbers of the CohFT with the DR cycle, the top Hodge class $\lambda_g$, and powers of a psi-class. The question whether the DR hierarchy is endowed with a bihamiltonian structure appeared to be much harder. In our previous work in collaboration with S. Shadrin, when the CohFT is homogeneous, we proposed an explicit formula for a differential operator and conjectured that it would provide the required bihamiltonian structure. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Our proof is based on two recently proved results: the equivalence of the DR hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy of a semisimple CohFT under Miura transformation and the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple CohFT. In particular, our second Poisson bracket coincides through the DR/DZ equivalence with the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy, hence providing a remarkably explicit approach to their bihamiltonian structure.</description>

      <title>$L^1$-Stability for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first establish the weak stability results for solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in relative full mass classes, extending the results known to hold in the full mass class. Building on weak stability, we then prove the $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}$ stability of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on quasi-projective varieties. As an application, we study the limit of the singular Ricci-flat metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Calabi-Yau projective varieties, inspired by Tosatti's work on Calabi-Yau projective manifolds.</description>
