      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on Rd with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. In an earlier joint work, we proved that the algorithm samples from Gibbs measures supported on torus with time complexity that is polynomial in the inverse temperature; however, the approach breaks down in the non-compact setting. This work overcomes this obstacle and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the seventh power of the inverse temperature, the square of the inverse allowed absolute error and the square of the inverse allowed probability error.</description>

      <title>The dynamic of a tax on land value : concepts, models and impact scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a spatial-dynamic framework to analyze the theoretical and quantitative effects of a Land Value Tax (LVT) on urban land markets, capital accumulation, and spatial redistribution. Building upon the Georgist distinction between produced value and unearned rent, the model departs from the static equilibrium tradition by introducing an explicit diffusion process for land values and a local investment dynamic governed by profitability thresholds. Land value $V (x, y, t)$ and built capital $K(x, y, t)$evolve over a two-dimensional urban domain according to coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, incorporating local productivity $A(x, y)$, centrality effects $\mu(x, y)$, depreciation $\delta$, and fiscal pressure $\tau$ . Analytical characterization of the steady states reveals a transcritical bifurcation in the parameter $\tau$ , separating inactive (low-investment) and active (self-sustaining) spatial regimes. The equilibrium pair $(V ^*, K^*)$ is shown to exist only when the effective decay rate $\alpha = r + \tau - \mu(x, y)$ exceeds a profitability threshold $\theta = \kappa + \delta / I_0$, and becomes locally unstable beyond this boundary. The introduction of diffusion, $D_V \Delta V$, stabilizes spatial dynamics and generates continuous gradients of land value and capital intensity, mitigating speculative clustering while preserving productive incentives. Numerical simulations confirm these analytical properties and display the emergence of spatially heterogeneous steady states driven by urban centrality and local productivity. The model also quantifies key aggregate outcomes, including dynamic tax revenues, adjusted capital-to-land ratios, and net present values under spatial heterogeneity and temporal discounting. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the main qualitative mechanisms-critical activation, spatial recomposition, and bifurcation structure-remain robust under alternative spatial profiles $(A, \mu)$, discretization schemes, and moderate differentiation of the tax rate $\tau (x, y)$. From an economic perspective, the results clarify the dual nature of the LVT: while it erodes unproductive rents and speculative land holding, its dynamic incidence on built capital depends on local profitability and financing constraints. The taxation parameter $\tau$ thus acts as a control variable in a nonlinear spatial system, shaping transitions between rent-driven and production-driven equilibria. Within a critical range around $\tau_c$, the LVT functions as an efficient spatial reallocation operator-reducing inequality in land values and investment density without impairing aggregate productivity. Beyond this range, excessive taxation induces systemic contraction and investment stagnation. Overall, this research bridges static urban tax theory with dynamic spatial economics by formalizing how a land-based fiscal instrument can reshape the geography of value creation through endogenous diffusion and nonlinear feedback. The framework provides a foundation for future extensions involving stochastic shocks, adaptive policy feedbacks, or endogenous public investment, offering a unified quantitative perspective on the dynamic efficiency and spatial equity of land value taxation.</description>

      <title>A two-parameter, minimal-data model to predict dengue cases: the 2022-2023 outbreak in Florida, USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable and timely dengue predictions provide actionable lead time for targeted vector control and clinical preparedness, reducing preventable diseases and health-system costs in at-risk communities. Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Optimizer Sensitivity In Vision Transformerbased Iris Recognition: Adamw Vs Sgd Vs Rmsprop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of biometric authentication is increasingly critical as digital identity systems expand. Iris recognition offers high reliability due to its distinctive and stable texture patterns. Recent progress in deep learning, especially Vision Transformers ViT, has improved visual recognition performance. Yet, the effect of optimizer choice on ViT-based biometric systems remains understudied. This work evaluates how different optimizers influence the accuracy and stability of ViT for iris recognition, providing insights to enhance the robustness of biometric identification models.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of self-repellent random walks, their local time and Event Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the self-repellent random walk and its local time process on the discrete circle $\mathbb{Z}_n$. While the self-repellent random walk alone is non-Markovian since the jump rates depend on its history via its local time, jointly considering the evolution of the local time profile and the position yields a piecewise deterministic, non-reversible Markov process. We show that this joint process can be interpreted as a second-order lift of a reversible diffusion process, the discrete stochastic heat equation with Gaussian invariant measure. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the relaxation time of order $\Omega(n^{3/2})$. Using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we prove an upper bound for a slightly modified dynamics of order $O(n^2)$, matching recent conjectures in the physics literature. Furthermore, since the self-repellent random walk and its local time process coincide with the Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the harmonic chain, a non-reversible MCMC method, we demonstrate that the relaxation time bound confirms the recent empirical observation that Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms can outperform traditional MCMC methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Theoretical guarantees for lifted samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifted samplers form a class of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods which has drawn a lot attention in recent years due to superior performance in challenging Bayesian applications. A canonical example of such sampler is the one that is derived from a random walk Metropolis algorithm for a totally-ordered state space such as the integers or the real numbers. The lifted sampler is derived by splitting into two the proposal distribution: one part in the increasing direction, and the other part in the decreasing direction. It keeps following a direction, until a rejection occurs, upon which it flips the direction. In terms of asymptotic variances, it outperforms the random walk Metropolis algorithm, regardless of the target distribution, at no additional computational cost. Other studies show, however, that beyond this simple case, lifted samplers do not always outperform their Metropolis counterparts. In this paper, we leverage the celebrated work of Tierney (1998) to provide an analysis in a general framework encompassing a broad class of lifted samplers. Our finding is that, essentially, the asymptotic variances cannot increase by a factor of more than 2, regardless of the target distribution, the way the directions are induced, and the type of algorithm from which the lifted sampler is derived (be it a Metropolis--Hastings algorithm, a reversible jump algorithm, etc.). This result indicates that, while there is potentially a lot to gain from lifting a sampler, there is not much to lose.</description>

      <title>Finite- and Large- Sample Inference for Model and Coefficients in High-dimensional Linear Regression with Repro Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel and effective inference approach to conduct both finite- and large-sample inference for high-dimensional linear regression models. This approach is developed under the so-called repro samples framework, in which we conduct statistical inference by creating and studying the behavior of artificial samples that are obtained by mimicking the sampling mechanism of the data. We construct confidence sets for (a) the true model corresponding to the nonzero coefficients, (b) a single or any collection of regression coefficients, and (c) both the model and regression coefficients jointly. To facilitate the constructions of these confidence sets and overcome computational difficulties of searching all possible models, we use an innovative Fisher inversion technique to construct a model candidate set that includes the true sparse model with the probability close to 1 for models with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors. The proposed approach fills in two major gaps in the high-dimensional regression literature: (1) lack of effective approaches to addressing model selection uncertainty and providing valid inference for the underlying true model; (2) lack of effective inference approaches to guaranteeing finite-sample performance. We provide both finite-sample and asymptotic results to theoretically guarantee the performance of the proposed methods. In addition, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods are valid and achieve better coverage with smaller confidence sets than the current state-of-the-art approaches, such as debiasing and bootstrap approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study the spatially homogeneous granular medium equation \[\partial_t\mu=\rm{div}(\mu\nabla V)+\rm{div}(\mu(\nabla W \ast \mu))+\Delta\mu\,,\] within a large and natural class of the confinement potentials $V$ and interaction potentials $W$. The considered problem do not need to assume that $\nabla V$ or $\nabla W$ are globally Lipschitz. With the aim of providing particle approximation of solutions, we design efficient forward-backward splitting algorithms. Sharp convergence rates in terms of the Wasserstein distance are provided.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop pre-trained estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator uses a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. Once trained, the estimator can be shared and applied to different datasets at negligible cost and effort. Under sufficient training, the estimator converges to the Bayesian posterior given the data patterns. As an illustration, we construct a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model (available at pnnehome.github.io). Estimation takes only seconds and achieves high accuracy on 12 real datasets. More broadly, pretrained estimators can make structural models much easier to use and more accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration of computer models is a key step in making inferences, predictions, and decisions for complex science and engineering systems. We formulate and analyze a nonparametric Bayesian methodology for computer model calibration. This paper presents a number of key results including; establishment of a unique nonparametric Bayesian posterior corresponding to a chosen prior with an explicit formula for the corresponding conditional density; a maximum entropy property of the posterior corresponding to the uniform prior; the almost everywhere continuity of the density of the nonparametric posterior; and a comprehensive convergence and asymptotic analysis of an estimator based on a form of importance sampling. We illustrate the problem and results using several examples, including a simple experiment.</description>
